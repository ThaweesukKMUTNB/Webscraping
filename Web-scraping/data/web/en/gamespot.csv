gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-in-elden-ring-the-games-story-part-3-caelid/1100-6502962/,having defeated godrick the grafted traveled through liurnia of the lakes and faced the academy of sorcerers there are two major options facing players in elden ring you can continue to make their way north to the altus plateau home of the foot of the erdtree or they can venture east of limgrave to the festering lands of caelid in fact one of the paths to the altus plateau requires you to head to caelid and fight your way through a fort infested with giant bats so before moving farther north we going to head east to claim a third great runeyou can access caelid pretty early but it can be a tough place for any tarnished to survive that because caelid is ravaged by something called scarlet rot the creeping disease infects living things and pools in a huge fetid swamp resulting in a whole region filled with putrefying monstrous creatures it also the home of radahn one of the demigod children of radagon and rennala the shardbearer waits for you on the eastern coast of caelid but unlike the others radahn isn gathering power or planning to try to become elden lord you soon see whythe reason caelid is so messed up is because it was the scene of a major turning point in the shattering marking the end of most major hostilities and the beginning of the demigods mostly retreating to their lands and strongholds the scarlet rot is the result of a battle between the greatest warriors among the demigod children radahn and malenia their clash destroyed caelid by unleashing the disease but it also destroyed both malenia and radahn here what you need to know about what happening in caelid as always there be spoilers beyondmore elden ring story explainerselden ring story guide the lore and history of the lands betweenwhat happens in elden ring the game story part liurnia of the lakesthe frenzied flame and the game bleakest ending explainedas you first enter caelid you largely find it in ruinsmoreso than usual i guesswith diseased birds and dogs feasting on bodies of the dead corpses are piled together and burned in ravaged buildings but some of those corpses are undead and need to be burned again to prevent them from exploding and spraying disease everywhere fire is almost as much a part of caelid as the scarlet rot and you soon see why soldiers and knights still loyal to radahn are trying to push back the scourge by burning it near redmane castle radahn former seat of power you see coordinated groups of soldiers ambushing attacking and burning the giant trexlike dogs that maraud the land a reverence for flame has become a calling card of radahn formidable soldiers in fact and you see fires set all over caelid as they work to hold back the rot as best they can and burn anything afflicted with it but while the humans are trying to take back the land from the disease at best it a stalematein the center of caelid is the swamp of aeonia where the rot is worst the infected water spreads the disease to anything that touches it making this a dangerous place to cross you can find cleanrot knights here remnants of the force loyal to malenia that marched with her to fight radahn scarlet rot in fact came from malenia at least in a roundabout way and the battle between her and radahn is why it covers caelid the cleanrot knights pledged their loyalty to malenia in spite of the fact that they knew they contract scarlet rot if they did so they not immune to the disease but have accepted the putrefaction of their flesh that speaks to the kind of loyalty malenia and her brother miquella instill in people we talk about both of them in more detail in later articlesthere are others who are not just willing to succumb to the rot but who actually worship it you find these pests humansized centipedelike creatures in a few places around caelid these beings seem to worship the scarlet rot and moreover the real force behind it an outer god we know little about the god of rot but it does seem to have influence in the lands between and it appears to be responsible for malenia rot curse you later find the pests in certain locations like the underground lake of rot that suggests they have a hidden culture and agenda of their ownfar in the north of caelid you find greyoll dragonbarrow a mesa that has been taken over by dragons and other creatures the nearby fort faroth has been invaded by vicious giant bats and there you can find half of the medallion that allows access to the grand lift of dectus which will carry you from liurnia bellum highway to the altus plateau the first half is in fort haight in limgrave among a whole bunch of smaller baby dragons you can find a huge one in the center elder greyoll the mother of all dragons greyoll won fight you herself and actually seems barely able to move using her dragon children for protection we don know much about greyoll or the dragons who live here but the title mother of all dragons seems significant in terms of what we learn about dragons through the course of the game especially later in farum azula in essence you can kill greyoll but one wonders if that might put an end to the future for dragons all togetherheading even further north you can find a cathedrallike building called the beastial sanctum inside is a strange character named gurranq described as a beast clergyman gurranq a bit weirdhe covers himself in a shabby cloth and seems barely able to restrain himself he asks you to bring him deathroot something that only grows in the presence of beings called those who live in deathremember rogier from back in limgrave his quest also deals with those who live in death and you can meet a second tarnished who goes by d who also interested in them those who live in death are undead people who don follow the rules of the golden order when people die their souls are supposed to return to the erdtreethat why catacombs in the lands between are built near erdtree roots which you always find in their boss rooms those who live in death don return to the erdtree and thus remain in their bodies living despite having died like zombies or more often as skeletons d hunts those who live in death on behalf of the beast clergyman and the golden order bent on eradicating them believing them to be an affrontif you sign up with gurranq he give you an item called the beast eye which quivers whenever you near those who live in death kill them and you can bring their deathroot back to gurranq who trades it for various beast incantations gurranq eats the deathroot but his hunger for it can never be sated and seems to be nearly driving him mad in fact at one point when you interact with him he attack you if you smack a little sense into him he snap out of it but it seems like this is an indication that gurranq addiction to deathroot and obsession with those who live in death is damaging his mindfor the time being gurranq is just a strange character for whom you can do some jobs killing those who live in death venturing further into the lands between however we learn more about his deal what up with the undead what rogier is trying to uncover and how it all ties together with the assassination of godwyn the goldenthe shardbearer you seeking in caelid is general radahn perhaps the fiercest warrior among the demigod children of marika with only malenia able to challenge him for the title the son of radagon and rennala radahn is huge and ludicrously strong sporting red hair like radagon he took after both his parents to become a great champion studying warfare as well as sorcery radahn specializes in magic related to gravity learned in the caelid sorcerer town of sellia which he pursued at least in part so that he could use magic to help his tiny but beloved horse support his enormous body and let him keep riding it when you finally fight him you see the mountain of a man carried along on a horse that absolutely should have been crushed under his weightwhen radagon was with rennala he studied sorcery and later with marika studied the incantations of the golden order faith radahn took at least part of a page from his father studying to become the strongest warrior he could be but like rennala other children it seems like radahn stopped idolizing his father to some degree after he departed liurnia to return to leyndell instead radahn looked to another warrior for inspiration godfrey he leaned hard into a lion motif for his armor and castle which was a symbol synonymous with the first elden lord with radahn purposely invoking one of the greatest fighters the lands between had ever seen it hard to see this as anything other than a slight against radagon the second elden lord and godfrey replacement as marika consortwhen it comes to radagon though radahn might have been a reminder of something the elden lord hated about himself as she was consolidating her power marika waged war on the giants in the north of the lands between alongside godfrey elden ring lore tells us that all the giants had red hair as did radagona fact he hated actually all of radagon children wound up with red hair though in ranni case this is a bit speculative since we don see her actual body in anything but a crispy burnt form in addition radahn is huge much bigger than any of the other demigods kind of like a giant it speculative at this point because radagon backstory is a whole murky thing that becomes a bigger part of the story later but there a theory among fans that radagon may have been descended from or otherwise related to the giants in some way an aspect of himself that he seems to have despised radahn then would have been a very big ahem reminder of radagon giant heritage and that likely would have damaged their fatherson relationshipeither way radahn made a name for himself on the battlefield his mastery of gravity magic earned him the name starscourge although this part is a little hazy apparently radahn gravity magic was so powerful that he could stop the turning of the stars this is perhaps a bit more metaphorical than it first appears to be what this seems to be in practical terms is that radahn was able to use gravity magic spells to prevent meteors falling to earthagain we in speculative territory but i think this is specifically a practical move that targeted raya lucaria as well as the people of the underground eternal cities which we haven talked about yet the sorcerers of liurnia channel their strength from the stars and a lot of their gravity magic is actually directly related to meteorsas if they use magic to yank small celestial bodies out of space and chuck them at their enemies it sounds like this meteor magic could have been used to destroy farum azula the floating city of the dragons it essentially a superweapon in the hands of a bunch of people who don really subscribe to the golden order this is actually reflected in the game by the fact that all sorcereries use the intelligence stat while incantations of the golden order use the faith stat this is almost like the conflict between science and religion plus liurnia only came into the fold of the golden order when radagon married rennala radahn might not have been a fan of his father but he was still part of the ruling class so i think the starscourge title came from him using his powerful gravity magic to render the stars incapable of falling taking away the ability of raya lucaria to use meteors as weaponsit also possible this was a move aimed at protecting against attacks or incursions from outer gods or other cosmic forces radahn is said to have studied gravity magic in sellia under an alabaster lord one of an ancient race who supposedly were born from a meteor that struck the lands between in the distant past there are also several creatures who are linked directly to meteorswe can find more than one fallen star beast a monster that literally falls to earth from space and fight two versions of a boss called astel which seems to be some kind of cosmic horror starmonster as well radahn experience with an alabaster lord in his youth might have given him an inkling of the dangers that lurk beyond in the voidlater during the shattering malenia marched south from the stronghold she shared with her brother miquella at a place called the haligtree this was when she passed through limgrave and humiliated the cowardly godrick after that she headed to caelid to face radahn as the demigods warred over who should claim the elden ring radahn would have been her strongest competition among the demigods and if they hadn faced one another it seems like one of them might have managed to consolidate enough power to claim the elden ring that not how it went down thoughmalenia faced radahn on caelid vast wailing dunes near the continent shores there the pairs of armies faced each other down and a huge number of people were killed as malenia faced radahn she quickly found she couldn beat him under normal meanshe was too strong and too skilled in order to match his ferocity malenia gave up the pride and determination she used to hold the rot at bay within herself she bloomed literally appearing cocooned in a giant flower as part of the curse which essentially caused an explosion of scarlet rot radahn as well as the rest of caelid were infectedthe battle had huge consequences for everyone involved neither radahn nor malenia was actually able to win the battle and in giving herself over to the rot malenia lost somethingsome part of her sense of self and her will she fell into a deep sleep and her cleanrot knights had to evacuate her one knight finley carried malenia all the way back to the northern mountains to the haligtree where she and her brother miquella were basedmalenia and her knights retreated but radahn didn win either the scarlet rot infection ravaged him from the inside out but because marika removed the rune of death from the elden ring radahn couldn die so he justkept rotting the infection drove him mad and he never returned to redmane castle instead he just wanders the battlefield now more monster than personwhen you finally make your way into the lands between depending on how far you progress in the rest of the game and who you talk to you might hear about the radahn festival if you met iron fist alexander the big living jar or progressed the quests of blaidd and ranni you hear about the festival from them the festival takes place at redmane castle in the southeast of caelid and draws tarnished warriors from all over to take part in itradahn troops are still loyal to him but as you learn when you reach redmane their lord is lost at this point everyone who liked the guy just wants him put out of his misery the festival is now run by a guy called jerren who you meet at redmane when you arrive along with other tarnished and blaidd if you progressed his questjerren explains the deal of the radahn festival which is both tragic and kind of hilarious after his fight with malenia radahn never returned to the castle he stayed out on the wailing dunes as the scarlet rot festered and drove him mad with pain the affect turned him beastlike and he just wanders the sands eating the corpses of the fallen soldiers who litter the battlefield the radahn festival isn a celebration of the former lord or his triumphs in battle it literally a tournament in which warriors show up and show their skill and strength by trying to kill radahn for the tarnished the reward is a great rune for radahn soldiers the upshot is their lord will finally be released from his maddening torment but in essence the remnants of redmane castle put a bounty out on their former general and turned his execution into a game and that what the radahn festival istaking part in the festival lets you head out to the wailing dunes and face radahn and if you so choose you can use elden ring summoning feature to bring all the other warriors you see at redmane into the fight with you as a team you all slug it out with radahn who is likely to beat the hell out of just about everyoneeven though he lost his mind he hasn lost any of his strength or skill he barely holding on from the infliction of the rot however and you can see this if you use weapons and items that inflict scarlet rot in this fight build up more rot infection on radahn and he goes down quickly suggesting the affliction becomes more than he can handleeventually though you bring radahn down finally killing him and ending his plight the radahn festival ends with a few of the other warriors congratulating you and talking about where they headed next with radahn defeated you can continue to advance ranni and blaidd quests since the death of the starscourge means the stars can move once again and meteors will immediately start to fallfalling stars will actually rip holes in limgrave opening a new pathway to buried locales below but before venturing down we head upto the altus plateau the foot of the erdtree and mt gelmir the home of some of the worst atrocities in the lands

for its devoted fanbase possibly fueled by an impending network sale that leaves us on a heck of a cliffhanger it feels like a good friend has left usit was the third or fourth show to join the arrowverse depending on whether you consider supergirl cbs season as being a part of it legends of tomorrow shouldn have worked it all started with a terrible pitch what if we took a bunch of side characters from different shows and made them time travelersand for the first season that was kind of true like many other shows with devoted fanbasesstar trek the next generation and parks and recreation come to mindit took the show a while to find its footing the first season was overly dramatic centering on the show leastlikeable charactersrip hunter hawkman hawkgirl and vandal savageand on characters bad decisions unnecessary secrets and worst of all a love trianglea few episodes into legends second season though the adults left the room and then didn bother to check on the weird kids for six seasonsthings immediately strayed into the bizarre with reverseflasheobard thawne migrating from the flash with his other faceplayed by matt letscher instead of tom cavanaghto antagonize the legends he was later joined by arrow villains damien darhk neal mcdonough and malcolm merlyn john barrowman to form the legion of doom throughout the season the legends would fight confederate soldiers meet jonah hex take part in the first fullsize arrowverse crossover and meet all manner of historical figures from al capone to george washington ray goes to the moon with thawne forcing them to work together to get home the villains win and rewrite reality temporarily creating the first of many alternate timelines the show would explorethis second season felt gleefully unburdened compared to the first it made great use of previous villains for one this is something both marvel and dc shows struggle with villains tend to be a big bad for a season they killed and then they gone for good they rarely given the opportunity to resurface the way villains do in the comic book source material damien darhk for example was a badlywritten arrow villain that brought stakes that were much too high for the show about the man who shows colorful pointy sticks and his girlfriend who hacks things with her ipad against a team of time travelers that include an atomic man an atomsized man and someone who can summon any animal they want though he a much better fit darhk would go on to recur throughout the show first as a villain and then as a begrudging antihero redeemed by his daughter and the legends relentless optimism he developed into a sympathetic character that was the perfect definition of a recurring villain and was given room to change and grow throughout he one of my alltime favorite characters in the arrowverse despite his rough patch on arrow and it all thanks to legendsthe show also became absolutely unafraid to be silly and in active conversation with its fanbase when a stuffed animal named beebo inadvertently became an oracle to a band of vikings the fandom latched onto him making him a hilarious recurring character the season finale had the legends transforming voltronstyle into a giant beebo and then showing its shaolin style to a time demonlegends also got metatextualmaking fun of itself and of televisionin a way that calls to mind something like nbc community for example that time demon mallus is voiced by character actor john noble in the episode guest starring john noble they kidnapped john noble from the lord of the rings set where he played denethor so that they could have him pretend to be mallus to try to manipulate an evil character into doing you know less evil so they had the actor who plays the part of the villain play himself playing the part of the villainlater the show would goof around with parodies and do great sendups of tv genres and other tropes sara lance once told a character that the crew wasn allowed to talk about macguffins before she had her coffee macguffin is the term used in storytelling critique to talk about the item everyone is afterthe holy grail the allspark etcbut which isn actually the point of the story they parody star trek friends and more but it was always always with the intention of telling us something about the charactersthese characters were not static and even throwaway jokes became central to the characters zari during a timeloop episode learned that hardened thief mick rory had a secret knack for writing romance novels and that would later become an important part of his character rather than a silly joke that made fun of someone having feelings and expressing them throughout his six seasons with the show rory evolved from a hardened criminal to a loving if very surly father and someone proud to be part of the legends teamit tough to write stuff like this that winks at the audience but doesn do so at the expense of the characters and legends deftly balanced this throughout its runsomething that would be a problem for other shows became a strong point for legends a huge revolving cast the first season saw the exit of three of the waverider characters and that began a tradition that would last through the show run each season would see some characters leave the show and others join that meant that the core crew from season dwindled until only sara lance was left but it also brought great characters like john constantine aboard the team timeshipactress maisie richardsonsellers joined the show as amaya jiwe and later shifted to the role of charlie a shapechanger who became stuck in the form of jiwe and eventually came to like it matt ryan joined as john constantine but would later play gwyn davies tala ashe played two wildly different versions of her character zari one a flannelwearing donutloving hacker and another from an alternate timeline where she was a kardashianlike fashionfirst media mogul the show took care of its actors like that giving them both reasons to stay on the show if they wanted and to flex their acting chops by playing different characters and sporting different lookseven characters that felt so random and weird at first became beloved members of the group such as when a change to the timeline replaced zari with her brother the lovable stoner behrad the missteps here were few and far between with even initially obnoxious characters like gary greene finding a way to fit into the show and grow into a full personthroughout its run the legends would contend with historical time anomalies resurrected souls from hell aliens and mythological creatures making sure that things never felt like a villainoftheweek treadmill despite the show being of a similar budget if not smaller budget as compared to other arrowverse shows legends were constantly ending up in new locations and time periods the set designers and directors never made these feel cheap despite how cheap they probably were in reality the show wasn overly concerned with realism but instead understood the fine line between capturing the essence of something and slavishly recreating every detaillegends was so silly and true to itself throughout its run that it made the other arrowverse shows look worse by comparison it was unafraid to transform itself and take chances to give its cast and characters the room they needed to flourish it felt the series was playing a prank on the network and all of the other shows as devastating as it is that the show was canceled it hard not to be grateful that we got seven seasons of this utter nonsensei wish we gotten to meet booster gold for more than the last half of the season finale donald faison would fit in with the legends crew swimmingly we would been able to say goodbye to sara lance and the waveriderlegends of tomorrow shouldn have worked but the writers and cast loved the show so much that they willed it to work they molded and chiseled away at it until the worst parts fell away to reveal even more silliness and personality there are still arrowverse shows on the cw the flash will get a season superman and lois a season but as the cw prepares to sell itself off to the highest bidder it looked to shave off shows that weren quite so successful legends slid under the radar for so long and it feels like someone finally checked the books and realized that somehow this show was still being filmed and aired by the networkas legends of tomorrow dies it hard not to see it as the beginning of the end of the arrowvers and that doesn even account for the fact that it was cancelled on the same day as batwoman effectively ending both of the network lgbtqled superhero shows at once both legends and the arrowverse were weird ambitious experiments that despite flaws worked better than they should for those of us that found legends of tomorrow it was a true gift of a show a gem in the cw crown and one of the few superhero shows that stood out as offering something different from the overdramatic apocalyptic tone of so many other superhero shows and moviesimage credit the cw network llc all rights reservedgot a news tip or want to contact us directly

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzones-caldera-map-continues-to-improve-with-season-3/1100-6503058/,call of duty warzone caldera map arrived for season of vanguard shifting players from the drab buildings of verdansk to a sunny island getaway however season also launched with myriad problems on caldera that hindered the enjoyment and playability of the map now with the launch of season warzone tropical island is a much better place to visitcall of duty season made it really hard to enjoy the beauty of the island with graphical bugs that caused giant polygon monsters to swallow buildings and players whole consoles struggled to keep up with several crashing and performance issues across playstation and xbox systems some of the operator skins in the battle pass were also broken leaving many players to abuse skins that allowed them to be nothing more than a floating head on the map making them frustrating to encounter furthermore the ricochet anticheat that was promised also didn arrive to all regions at launch so hackers continued to spoil all the fairness and fun overall caldera was a refreshing change in scenery for warzone but it got off to a really bad startyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing call of duty warzone season three operation monarch cinematic trailerthe tides shifted as call of duty season was delayed which activision said was to give developers of both warzone and vanguard time to hammer out the issues within both games shortly after the announcement warzone developers admitted the game was broken and bloated but reaffirmed the studio dedication to fixing the problems a delay in content can feel like a bummer but the extra time helped raven software put caldera in a much more playable state several updates were made to reduce the bugs and improve the game overall performance and the eventual launch of season continued to bring positive changes to warzone new mapas raven software whittled down the issues with caldera a much smoother experience arrived with season big update this improved version of caldera also included new features and points of interest to breathe more life into the battle royale season redeploy balloons were a big hit with players allowing them to zip up and parachute back down to more easily traverse the massive islandwith the recent launch of season classified arms caldera continues to evolve into a much more satisfying battle royale experience season for warzone is themed around the upcoming battle between godzilla and king kong for the operation monarch event bringing a host of positive map changes to calderato start the island has shifted from a sunny paradise to a cloudy overcast this atmospheric change makes a drastic improvement to visibility on the island and players seem to be loving the lighting change additional improvement in visibility also comes from changes that raven software made to reduce the thick foliage in some areas of the island as a result there are fewer shadows and hiding spots making it easier for players to spot enemiesseason also brings the new dig site point of interest and several other map changes to give caldera a fresh skull islandinspired appearance for the upcoming arrival of king kong and godzilla caldera ancient ruins volcano and newly unearthed monster bones make this the perfect place for the hollywood titans to throw down overall the map just looks more interesting and fun in this current seasonit also worth mentioning that raven software has done a pretty good job of keeping the weapon meta healthy for warzone pacific much of the lifespan of the verdansk map was left to the chaos of overpowered guns but the developer is now staying on top of weapon balancing broken weapons don stay broken for long and players aren limited to using just a handful of guns to just to compete with the pack season recent weapon balancing made major changes to warzone sniper rifles and we recommend a few loadouts to try the perk system even got a few changes including the addition of lootable perks to give players an additional way to get their perks equippedthe anticheat is also doing a solid job of detecting cheaters as some players have been praising ricochet for the lack of hackers in their matches activision latest update to the software is even going so far as to troll cheaters with the new cloaking feature which is a function that makes cheaters unable to see or hear any legitimate playerswhile it unfortunate that warzone pacific often felt like an unplayable experience in season it great to see raven software make good on the promise to get warzone into better shape season feels like the best version of caldera yet and it should hopefully leave players more confident that warzone will continue to receive positive changes as vanguard seasons progressof course it uncertain how long caldera will stick around as warzone has already been announced the battle royale sequel is currently being developed alongside this year call of duty modern warfare however players are still left wondering if their cosmetics will transfer over to warzone but developers recently discussed the issues

one another in a friendly competition to see which of the three character classes will reign supreme whether the bragging rights interest you or not you want to pick up the guardian games new submachine gun the title this slick little gun carries some of the best perks in the class along with a new origin trait just for the guardian games called classy contenderif you lean into the guardian games you likely get multiple rolls of the title but your first chance at the gun will require you to finish the event opening quest best in class it not especially difficult but it is something you want to knock out quickly in order to start messing around with your new gun and to fully open up your guardian games options here how to knock out the quest quickly and claim the titleyour quest starts in the tower with eva levante the event vendor who shows up in the center of the courtyard to start you want to claim your guardian games class item which you get for free after that pick a contender card from eva you going to need to complete a playlist activity like a strike or gambit match so pick the card that lines up with whatever you want to do nextyou should only need to complete one activity so all options are equalwhen you get into your activity you want to earn earn laurels one of the main currencies of the guardian games laurels drop while you wearing your guardian games class item whenever you kill strong enemiesanything with an orange health bar or yellow health baror when you take out enemies with your abilities you can earn laurels anywhere so long as you wearing your guardian games class item this step also requires you to earn a medallion but if you killing enemies with a mind toward getting laurels you should earn one along the way we completed this step in a single strikeafter you knocked out your activity and earned a few laurels you return to the tower to deposit your medallion in the big podium in the center of the courtyard return to eva and she give you another item the medallion case which tracks the medallions you earn and the laurels you carrying at any given timehead next to zavala and he introduce you to a few new elements of the guardian games first are vanguard medals which are like triumphs you receive for doing things in the guardian games playlist medals unlock for all sorts of reasons like killing three enemies with melees in rapid succession gaining killstreaks with specific weapons using your abilities and more there are also three new guardian games playlists for you to access from the tower courtyard screen in the director the recreational playlist is a little easier and more casual while the training and competitive playlists are a bit more serious jump into the recreational playlist and grab any vanguard medal in order to proceed on the best in class quest you get one for basically anything you do but a quick and easy way to earn one is to quickly melee three weak enemiesreturn to the tower after knocking out a recreational playlist activity and you can wrap up the quest speak with zavala first who will give you a new item for tracking your scores and then head to eva to get your first copy of the titlethe title is a significant smg because it has a high rate of fire and solid range that makes it similar to other great smgs like funnelweb a current favorite what might put the title ahead of other competitors is its new origin trait classy competitor with this equipped you earn class ability energy with every kill the gun also fires void ammo which means you can synergize it with new void aspects and fragments which allows the gun to fire volatile roundsthe first copy of the title you get comes with demolitionist and vorpal weapon for its perks but bungie noted in its recent this week at bungie blog post that you can earn various rolls of the gun as well as masterworked version with double perks in the third and fourth slots from what we can tell however the title doesn drop just from guardian games activitiesat least not in the recreational and training playlists it seems very likely that if you want additional rolls of the title you need to earn light the bronze silver gold and platinum torches in the game and earn their rewardslighting the torches is part of the guardian games medallion battalion quest you can pick up from eva it tracks your progress in depositing medallions for your class in the podium in the tower awarding points based on the rarity of the medallions you dropping inthe highest points are for platinum medallions while bronze awards the lowest deposit enough medals and you unlock the ability to light a torch behind the medallion podium in the tower which unlocks a reward for the week after unlocking the bronze torch our rewards hasn unlocked yet suggesting you need to wait until the weekly reset to actually reap these rewards you can light up to eight torches in a weektwo each for bronze silver gold and platinum levelswith corresponding rewards for each torchso although we unsure of exactly what you earn from these torchlightings it seems that better versions of the title are very likely to drop here we also waiting to see what potential rewards will come from the guardian games competitive playlist which is only accessible during the weekends the idea is to play the training playlist during the week to unlock special buffs for your character and then play the competitive playlist over the weekend to unlock better rewards and earn more medallions for your class we update this article when the competitive playlist unlocks with more informationgamespot may get a commission from retail offersgot a news tip or want to contact us directly email news ,Destiny 2 The Title SMG Guide: How To Get

killing mohg lord of blood locks you out of obtaining the white mask if you already beaten him you need to wait until ng to get this helmthere are two ways to reach the mohgwyn palace completing white mask varre questline or reaching a portal deep in the consecrated snowfieldwhite mask varre questline can be completed very early in the game so this is the option to go with if you want to get your hands on the white mask as quickly as possible in a new gamevarre is the first npc you encounter in elden ring standing right next to the first step site of grace talk to him here then return to this location after defeating godrick the grafted in stormveil castle or after obtaining any great rune he will instruct you to visit the roundtable hold and meet the two fingers do so then head to liurnia of the lakesthe second location you find varre is at the rose church just south of raya lucaria academy talk to him here and tell him the two fingers didn seem right when he asks your impression of them talk to him again and he will give you five festering bloody fingers a consumable item used for invading other players in pvpuse the fingers to invade three different players then return to varre he will ask you to join him in serving luminary mohg lord of blood allow him to anoint you and he will give you the lord of blood favor instructing you to soak it in a maiden blood as your final stepthe closest place to do this is at the church of inhibition tucked away in the northeast corner of liurnia when you get there head over to the maiden corpse in the chair grab the finger maiden set from her then select dye cloth with maiden bloodwith your newly bloodsoaked lord of blood favor in hand head back to varre he will congratulate you on completing your final trial cut off your finger and reward you with a reusable blood finger talk to him again and he will give you the pureblood knight medal a reusable item that can instantly teleport you to mohgwyn palace from anywhere use it head up the stairs and rest at the dynasty mausoleum entrance site of gracethis is the far simpler option of the two but you won be able to get there until later in the game you first need to make it to the altus plateau by collecting both halves of the dectus medallion in limgrave and caelid respectively from there you must defeat morgott the omen king in leyndell to gain access to the mountaintops of the giants finally you must complete latenna questline to get both halves of the haligtree secret medallion only then can you access the consecrated snowfield by using the grand lift of roldonce you make it to the hidden path to the haligtree site of grace head northwest until you hit the yelough anix ruinsit hard to see through the snow in this area but it basically a straight shot from there continue northwest until you find a lone albinauric guarding a portal on the side of the cliff take down the sanguine noble invader collect the sanguine noble set and enter the portal to mohgwyn palace head out of the cave and follow the trail to your left until you reach the palace approach ledgeroad site of graceyou find the white mask in a lake of blood in the southeast section of the map to get there from the dynasty mausoleum entrance site of grace simply head down the stairs and continue forward hugging the cliffside on your right until the lake of blood narrows into a stream there will be giant crows dogs and deadly bloodgeysers ahead so tread lightly to get here from the palace approach ledgeroad site of grace head down the hill past the hordes of albinaurics once you reach the lake hug the left wall until you reach the streamcontinue forward you will be invaded by three different nameless white mask npc invaders in this area naturally they inflict bleed their combos can be lethal if you get caught in them so be ready to dodge away when they rush you try to pick off some enemies from a distance before going in or consider luring the invaders away the giant crows are extremely aggressive and can spot you from a distancethe first invader will appear right at the entrance of the lake the second will appear near the rocks to your left neither of these drop any items but you want to get them out of the way nonetheless finally head to the cliffside at the far south end of the lake you find the final invader there behind a large treekill the final invader

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/back-4-blood-tunnels-of-terror-dlc-review/1900-6417865/,since back blood debuted in october it been players bestlooking and perhaps most extravagant left dead successor since the original sequel in but it also been a frustratingly inconsistent game to play in one level you may excitedly limp to the saferoom as a swarm scratches at your heels the way any horde shooter should often feel only for the next level to be a mess of enemy spam and poor objective design six months later pacing and design issues still hinder the experience in the game first expansion tunnels of terror but the moments of frustration are finally showing signs of waning alongside some fun additions to the game core campaignthe tunnels of terror expansion adds two characters a slew of weapons and seven new levels to back blood in the form of ridden hives rather than offer up another underplayed side attraction to the main campaign these ridden hives are smartly built right into the game original already lengthy story mode spawning at random hives act as highrisk highreward optional dungeons into which a full team must agree to descend togethertauntingly they often appear near safe rooms giving squads of cleaners a decision to make head for the security of the bright orange door or sink into the hellish hives for the game best loot for any highlevel players the decision should be an easy one legendary weapons can only be found in these hives not to mention the game new free currency skull totems which can unlock exclusive new cosmetics those factors should mean that the toughest roguelite runs demand at least one pit stop in a hive for better weapons however the game legacy issues like poorly balanced enemy swarms continue to get in the wayacross the game seven hives each has a second inner hive region that is meant to be even harder and they certainly are but not in a fun way rather than pit you in inventive new scenarios like splitting up the group or putting you in tough flightorfight situations the ai director simply throws a lot more of the game mutations special infected at youit feels like a game of dd being run by a dungeonmaster with a puerile idea of the rule of cool sometimes less is more but back blood continues to reject the notion opening a door and being met with four minibosses at once isn interesting it just exhausting and doing that five times in a single hive makes it that much more of a slog as a saving grace the ai teammates seem better now than they did at launch meaning these overwhelming hordes are sometimes more manageableat the very least predictablewhen played offline due to the way the ai aims expertly and defends you like their monarchthese ongoing issues are why i found it both frustrating and funny that alongside the dlc came an even harder difficulty for those who want it i don know anyone who thinks the game is properly balanced at its lowest difficulty so introducing a new ceiling without repairing that shoddy floor feels like the wrong way to goat least some other parts of these hives are worthwhile the loot itself is great offering weapons with impressive stats and special abilities in a move borrowed from loot shooters each bundle of these weapons is also stashed in a warped chest and opening such a chest deals trauma damage to your whole squad making hp harder to restore any cleaner can unilaterally open a warped chest which makes communication keyand the lack thereof potentially damning for team chemistryi found that so long as the ai director was only being tough but fair the hives themselves were well worth venturing into each time i came upon one my group was eager to head inside suggesting that the riskreward balancing act done by developer turtle rock is better off than its horde cadencewhile the hives do vary somewhat in design they all largely follow the same basic principles they sprawling mazes of flesh where exits must be noted mentally by any team wishing to make a quick exit after clearing them out getting lost is a deliberate part of the process and teams that split up to tackle each titular tunnel will soon remember teamwork is paramounti wish there were more variety in the hives actual looks but i do also appreciate the background lore that pours out of them their mere existence paints the ridden in more vibrant colors zapping my brain with fun questions like how long were they down there and how could these things ever be truly exterminated these questions don have answers and i like it that way they remind me of the purposely vague hints of how the downfall happened in any classic zombie storythe tunnels of terror expansion is both a decent addition in its own right and a progress report on back blood ongoing struggles to find proper balance and pace thanks to the accompanying patch i witnessed fewer moments of frustration in the past week than i ever have beforemonster spam in the inner hives notwithstandingand that heartening as someone who would very much like to play this game for a long time if it can just iron out some more wrinkles for now it still a bit messy but ahead of the headlining additions of new levels characters and weapons i find the most promising aspect of tunnels of terror is its lengthy list of patch notes,Back 4 Blood: Tunnels Of Terror DLC

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rogue-legacy-2-review-grand-lineage/1900-6417870/,if you were to draw up a blueprint of the ideal video game sequel it would be a schematic of rogue legacy the latest roguelite dungeon crawler from developer cellar door games retains everything that was captivating about the original while improving upon it with some fantastic new additions if you played the first game you notice there an immediate familiarity to rogue legacy crunchy combat and satisfying gameplay loop yet it doesn take long for new wrinkles to appear that significantly alter each run through its evershifting worldthe basic premise of rogue legacy is identical to that of the first game you play as a valiant adventurer who sent to explore the ruins of a mysterious castle your ultimate goal is to find and defeat six unique bosses in order to unlock an imposing door that leads to the final area as you gallivant across rogue legacy six varied and increasingly treacherous biomes you accrue golden coins by opening chests and vanquishing enemies this wealth can then be used to purchase permanent upgrades like increased health strength intellect and so on unfortunately for your intrepid explorer however they never get to spend this money themselves each time you die in rogue legacy you return to the beginning of the castle as your previous character offspring inheriting all of the gold and upgrades they acquired before perishingyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing rogue legacy launch announcementat the start of each run you asked to select from a trio of potential heirs all eager to venture off into what is usually certain doom sometimes these progenies arrive with randomly generated traits that can benefit or hinder them sir timothy ii for instance was an heir of mine who had hollow bones that made him fall slowly whereas lady jane suffered from a functional neurological disorder that rendered her unable to attack for a few seconds after sustaining damagesometimes these traits have no gameplay implications at all like lady michelle and the irritable bowel syndrome that made her fart a lot other times the complete opposite is true and you end up with someone like sir shawn a particularly unfortunate descendant who had a case of osteogenesis imperfecta which is a fancy way of saying a single hit was enough to kill him you won know what impact these traits will have until using them at least once but the game adds gold modifiers to entice you to pick an heir with lessthanideal traits so there an element of risk and reward that goes into each decisionthis genetic variation ensures that each run through the sprawling castle feels fresh yet rogue legacy chromosomal lottery also takes things a step further than its predecessor by introducing distinct character classes now the first game did have different character classes that would grant you specific spells and passive abilities but each scion would still charge into battle wielding the same greatsword with the same basic swordswinging mechanics this time around combat has been expanded with each class brandishing a signature weaponbarbarians carry an axe with a slow overhead swing and an aerial spin attack valkyries utilize a spear that can attack in four directions making it one of the few classes able to strike directly upwards boxers build up a combo meter with each punch gradually increasing in damage gunslingers meanwhile can rapidly shoot in any direction with the final eight bullets in a magazine dealing a critical blow there are also knights chefs mages assassins dragon lancers and more all with their own specific armaments spells health bars mana pools and so on no two classes feel alike which along with the randomized traits and spells makes each new run a unique experiencesome of these classes have more of a learning curve attached than others the bard for instance is particularly distinct they use a lute to shoot out musical notes that don deal a lot of damage by themselves but can be spinkicked to create a powerful explosion each class also has a singular talent usually acting as some form of defensive maneuver valkyries can spin their spear in a spry circle to deflect projectiles while the chef cooks up a stew to recover both health and manathere an immediate familiarity to rogue legacy crunchy combat and satisfying gameplay loop yet it doesn take long for new wrinkles to appear that significantly alter each run through its evershifting worldgetting to grips with each playstyle and finding which ones work for you is part of the joy of rogue legacy first couple of hours combat is engaging across the board too no matter which of the classes you using there a lovely heft and chomp to the action with enemies erupting into a shower of gold as you dash between fiery projectiles and slice through them with emphatic momentumthe delightfully varied enemy types that congregate in each biome are also a significant reason why rogue legacy combat is so enjoyable from detached floating hands wielding knives and mallets to poisonspewing mushroom creatures and zombies who suddenly emerge from the floor learning each one attack patterns and knowing how to counter them is crucial to staying alive it makes each encounter a tense and dynamic affairwhen you not fighting for your life you be exploring a procedurally generated world that rich in aesthetic diversity the cold stone walls of the initial castle eventually give way to snowcapped mountaintops an opulent study where paintings come to life and a cavernous underground cave system that feels like it descending straight to the earth core the gorgeous new art style does a fantastic job of bringing these areas to life foregoing the previous game stylings in favor of a cartoon look that utilizes sharp lines and vivid colors the backdrops are all entirely handdrawn while the characters and objects are making the action really pop off the screenif there a downside it that the map can sometimes feel a little too big you might spend multiple runs going through room after room without ever finding the boss resulting in plenty of backtracking as you return to areas you already cleared these don feel like wasted runs if you able to accumulate enough gold to buy a few upgrades but it does add an unsavory element to rogue legacy monetary grind progressing through each biome isn a straight run to the boss room either you may have to collect a couple of keys or defeat a miniboss or two before being able to face the area final challengeit here where rogue legacy adopts some light metroidvania trappings throughout the game you gradually acquire a variety of permanent abilities called heirlooms that let you reach previously inaccessible areas these include a double jump inair dash and more aside from acting as a key to unlock new biomes these abilities also have a fundamental impact on every other aspect of rogue legacy gameplay echo boots for instance is an heirloom that allows you to use spinkicks to bounce off what are called resonant platforms increasing your platforming range by launching you into the air and resetting your air dash but you can also use those kicks to destroy the resonant projectiles some enemies hurl at you adding a new wrinkle to some combat encountersif there one way in which rogue legacy is most like its predecessor it the punishing difficulty curve but there are more options for dealing with it here than in the original this is a challenging game but cellar door has made some concessions this time around to make it more approachable the addition of house rules lets you tweak the difficulty to your liking whether that means making the game slightly easier or ramping up the adversity for an even tougher challenge there are a couple of sliders that let you tweak global damage and health down to a minimum of and you can also toggle contact damage on or off and give yourself flight if a platforming section is proving insurmountable house rules are a welcome addition and though it can make the experience easier it doesn suddenly turn rogue legacy into an easy game your missteps just aren punished as harshly giving you a little more leeway to make mistakesalthough rogue legacy is built on a grind to purchase more upgrades and become stronger it always respects your time if you use a key to unlock a door that door will remain unlocked forever minibosses don return after you beaten them and you can pay a fee to permanently unlock teleporters at the beginning of each biome letting you jump ahead without having to find the area entrance again there also an architect who will lock the world for a percentage of your gold preventing it from changing at the beginning of each new run this way you can easily jump straight back into a boss fight without having to fight your way to itall of this makes rogue legacy difficult to put down the one more run effect is in full force as you choose yet another new heir to embark on another perilous journey the introduction of distinct classes with their own unique weapons is a masterstroke that elevates this sequel by building on what was already a fantastic premise and satisfying roguelite loop house rules make it more palatable for a wider audience but also give players an opportunity to tailor the challenge to their liking even if that means increasing the difficulty the breadth of its biomes can sometimes induce backtracking as you search for the path forward but this is a minor blemish on what is a fantastic game sacrificing

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-stanley-parable-ultra-deluxe-review-a-sequel-in-all-but-name/1900-6417868/,it incredibly bold to hide away a sequel to a game in an expanded rerelease of the original experience but when it comes to something as enjoyably strange and hilariously obtuse as the stanley parable it makes sensein fact my belief that the stanley parable ultra deluxe would be anything else seems fundamentally foolish in hindsightultra deluxe is as intriguing to play as the original game perhaps even more so today given that its message is directed toward the modernday gaming landscape some of the nuances will be a bit lost on you if you weren playing games or at least paying attention to the space back in as it relies on having a grasp of how the conversation surrounding games has evolved in the past decade but it an entertaining experience regardless of if you have that context or notthough it presented as a kind of director cut of the original ultra deluxe feels more like a sequel that exists within the stanley parable you still kicking things off by embodying the role of stanley an employee with the meaningless role of sitting in a drab office and staring at his computer screen all day pushing the buttons on his keyboard that he told to and then one day his screen stops telling him what to do gifting him with the freedom to listen to the overbearingly haughty narrator that oversees his every move or to do as he wishes insteadof course it not really freedom when given the option of walking through a door to the left or the right stanley isn being given an option at allhe being funneled down one of two possible paths each of which can branch into several predetermined outcomes upon reaching any of these conclusions the game resets to the beginning allowing you the chance to try a new path and uncover another outcomeit all meant to reflect the illusory sense of choice the player is presented with when they play any game that advertised as a choicedriven narrative this was a far more intriguing narrative setup back in when such selfreflection in video games wasn entirely common and the game design choices it commented on were more prevalent in it now feels like we already had this conversation the industry has since built upon this topic to create games that comment on a specific experience through some level of retrospection on the theme of choice and how it works within a medium where the recipient of the message isn a passive observerlike the notion of codeswitching and adopting new speech patterns in signs of sojourner or investigating power and privilege through varying degrees of autonomy in disco elysiumi wouldn go so far as to say that this makes the opening minutes of ultra deluxe boring but it isn a great first impression for firsttimers either given how outdated the commentary can feel for a little while at least you just playing the original gamewhich is no longer as unique as it once wasmaking the opening runs through ultra deluxe feel a bit outdatedthankfully you can just skip straight to the new content if you want with the game giving you the option right off the bat if you choose not to you need to play through the stanley parable a number of times and see a few of its different endings in order to unlock the new contentmuch of the new content plays similarly to the stanley parable allowing you to follow the narrator instructions or do the opposite you can press the button or not press the button you can jump or not jump you can carry the bucket or not carry the bucket you should carry the bucket your choices will cause the story to branch allowing you to reach several different endingssome are immensely entertaining variations on how the experience could already conclude in the stanley parable while others are brandnew all of them are rewarding to uncover with some surprises tucked into a fewthe main crux this time around is how the illusion of choice is redirected to encompass the gaming industry more as a whole since the relationship between developers and players has changed with bad faith players realizing they can weaponize social media to demand changes to games and developers learning the neverbeforeneeded skillset of balancing the desires of an insatiable playerbase and their own artistic vision when any possible change can potentially be achieved through an online update it truly brings a brandnew almost horrifying meaning to the stanley parable tagline phrase the end is never the end is never the endit a compelling concept to explore the idea that whether a developer listens to their players is just as arbitrary as whether a player decides to go through the door they told to when playing a game the stanley parable sort of broached this back in when some of its endings implied that the illusory sense of choice in games could be extended to other forms of interactions like your role in the workplace or conversations at home with your familyultra deluxe just focuses that idea on game development and then runs with it delivering an experience that hilariously funny but can also be spooky or tragic and i dare say that some of the new endings feel almost wistful regardless of their tone what i seen thus far has convinced me that i need to keep playing this game and see what other outcomes i can uncoverto say any more about this game could potentially spoil some of its delightful surprises of which there are many the stanley parable ultra deluxe has taken me on a rollercoaster of emotionsi be scratching my head in confusion one moment and then staring at my tv dumbfounded my mouth agape in incredulous bemusement the next as far as i can tell there no unifying mystery to solve here nor is there any sort of indistinguishable moral lesson that the game is asking me to uncover what is there however is an attractive lure for a thoughtprovoking experience about video games and how our reception of them has evolved,The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe Review - A Sequel In All But Name,en,434.0,Positive

residence including the tower hangar area on nessus in watcher grave and in the winding cove area of the edzthis week xur is selling hard light which is a great workhorse assault rifle you can use in a variety of content it a reliable gun for auto rifle fans with the added benefit of allowing you to change the element type of its ammo meaning the gun can cut through any kind of enemy shieldperfect for those activities that feature the equipment lock modification if you not a fan of his other options xur also sells an exotic engram that will decrypt into an exotic you don already own from the world drop pool just note that you can only buy one per week and the engram is specific to the character class who buys itso if you trying to get a new titan helmet don buy the engram with your warlock he also has the new xenology quest which rewards an exotic cipher you can use to purchase exotics from either xur or the tower monument to lost lights the quest requires you to either complete strikes or win matches in gambit and the cruciblealongside changes in his location xur inventory also rotates weekly that means it worth visiting him each time to check out his new weapons and rolls on exotic and legendary armor you can visit him any time between his arrival friday and the weekly reset at am pt pm et the following tuesday when xur departs the solar systemwe looking at a pvp god roll on dead man tale from xur this week vorpal weapon is a favorite on the gun in the crucible since it great for taking out guardians in supers and this version features a ton of range thanks to full bore and high caliber rounds the sacrifice is in stability so it comes down to what you like in your scout rifles but this is a phenomenal version of dead man tale that going to be very effective from a very long distance xur hawkmoon is similarly great for longrange fighting in the crucible thanks to the rangefinder perk and hammerforged rifling barrel alloy magazine for faster reloads and combat grip for better recoil round out the roll both are great gets for pvpminded players so pick them upxur other weapon offerings mostly aren nearly as cool as his dmt and hawkmoon with the exception of a couple of snipers the widow bite sniper rifle is pretty solid with firmly planted and snapshot sights allowing you to get fast highaccuracy shots if you crouch and a range masterwork the frozen orbit sniper rifle can with moving target increasing your target acquisition while helping make you harder to countersnipe and highimpact reserves for throwing in extra damage in the crucibleyou can grab the praefectus set of legendary armor from xur this week allowing you to pick up gear from the season of the chosen though his armor has some interesting rolls its total stats are all low enough that none of it is even really worth mentioning warlocks and titans get one piece at while the hunter armor peaks out at set season of the chosentitanwarlockhuntervarious nerfs and adjustments have diminished hard light somewhat but it still a nice reliable auto rifle for any situation you facing it handles itself pretty well in the crucible thanks to high stability and a highcapacity magazine you can also bounce rounds around corners thanks to its ricochet which is great for catching unsuspecting guardians by surprise in pve hard light is a workhorse since you can change the elemental type of its ammo making it great for cracking enemy shieldsthe hunter dodge is already a very cool ability and gemini jester makes it great for getting yourself out of sticky upclose situations against players or other enemies while wearing these spiffy pants your dodge disorients any enemy who too close while also removing their radar pair that with some invisibility

on your opponentsgreat for the crucible landing a hit with your charged melee attack also gives you melee energy back so you can smash through even more of the competition this roll is a bit of a weird one since mobility isn a very useful stat for titans but with the right build it might be worth picking upstatsnezarec sin is one of those goto exotics every void warlock should have in their arsenal and xur roll on it is a pretty great one the helmet gives you increased ability energy recharge whenever you get kills with void damage pairing it with void guns and the new void changes makes

art jammin chiptune soundtracks and pickupandplayability are timeless one undertheradar series that been rocking the retro aesthetic is gotta protectors a multiplayer overhead actiontower defenserealtime strategy fusion that earned fervent fans gotta protectors cart of darkness is the series latest entry and it a frenetically fun and strategic adventure alone or with up to three companionsthe world of gotta protectors is one of those video game fantasy universes where hordes of monsters are always attacking placing the kingdom in peril fortunately the kingdom has princess lola and her magical banner that can heal and protect all of her subjects except for herself that a pretty fatal flaw but fortunately she got a guardian army the gotta protectors a motley gang of warriors and weirdos whose purpose is to keep lola from harm and quench her thirst for monster blood by proxy and lola needs to be kept safe from all harm because there one other power she wields a shriek of frustration that can destroy everythingfrom the outset it clear that gotta protectors does not take itself very seriously your gang of protectors consists of a variety fantasy classes each with something a little off about them this includes an obnoxiously smug archer an old paladin trying to relive his glory days by riding a toy horse a ninja whose quest for unencumbered speed has left him practically naked a mystic whose antisocial nature leaves you wondering whose side she really on and an amazon who is what the kids these days call thicc among others adding to their humor is the fact that they all aware that they in a video game breaking the fourth wall and making deliberatelycringey pop culture and game references princess lola despite being so helpless that she can even move by herself gives them somewhat backhanded encouragement while gleefully reveling in their monster murder the bizzare humorous atmosphere and charming visual easter eggs scattered throughout try pressing x on the pause screen are a delight and help make cart of darkness stand out among similar retrostyled gamesthat not to say that the gameplay isn up to scratch however because gotta protectors is delightfully frenetic princess lola commands a rolling fortresscityonwheels that travels along train tracks to ram into and wreck enemy strongholds provided she sitting in the driver seat as lola either waits or chugs along the tracks in her battle fortress enemy hordes will appear and attempt to swarm the castle and harm her that where you and other players come inyou need to keep lola and the castle safe until the enemy base is destroyed because if she takes too much damage she will scream everything into oblivionprogress in cart of darkness is missionbased with each mission having four maps after building a team of three protectors and setting up their skills you be sent off to the battlefield to guard princess lola scurrying around the maps to set up barriers and autofire turrets taking out monstergenerating statues and making sure that you lola her castle and the barricades are all in good shape it might sound hecticand it is enemy swarms will appear at certain points and you need to adjust tactics on the fly to deal with the variety of foes goblin grunts beefy damagesponge minotaurs evasive flying bat and succubus gangs vanishing ghosts bombthrowing werebears speedy lizardmen poisonbarfing zombies and hardshelled giant insects every once in a while there a huge boss enemy that will require wits and strength to overcome too challenging you to employ unorthodox strategies to keep their overwhelming strength at baygotta protectors cart of darkness is a frenetically fun and strategic adventure alone or with up to three companionseach of your three protectors has up to three special abilities that you assign and you can swap your defender at any time their abilities vary by class and have many different effects building and repairing defensive barriers healing skills to help both you and lola offensive weapon attacks and magic summoned monsters to call to areas of the map movement and object rearrangement skills even decoys and traps every skill is useful in some way and learning how to best utilize theas well as figuring out an ideal skillspread amongst your teamis challenging and enjoyable and since skills cost money andor mp you need to be careful about using them as effectively as possiblewith waves of monsters constantly pouring in even weak foes can start to overwhelm lola quickly so smart skill use and barrierbuilding while prioritizing which enemy groups to eliminate is crucial after each map you be able to buy temporary upgrades for that mission however these upgrades revert after the mission and any gold spent this way is gold you can take back to town to buy character skills and permanent castle upgrades is making the game easier in the shortterm worth it that up to you to decidegotta protectors strength lies in its masterful blend of frenetic action and careful long and shortterm strategy do you spend money building a wall of barriers or turrets or count on your trigger finger and crowd control attacks to keep enemies at bay how good are you at putting out multiple fires at once often literally what do you do when a particularly nasty enemy variant suddenly emerges you need to make decisions very quickly and have the actiongame chops to back them up in multiplayer you coordinate with friends to accomplish the same goalit a little bit easier with more hands on deck but no less fun or frenziedbut cart of darkness isn without flaws and perhaps its most annoying element is how extremely grindy it can become upgrading your protectors and castle takes a lot of money and even if you frugal you can only bring back gold from a single missionand you usually bring back much less for reference new skillsets for each protector cost anywhere from gold requiring some mission replays and scrimpingandsaving to unlock everything missions are also quite longusually around minutes for your first playthrough of eachwhich means grinding that cash takes time also if you have to return to town midmission you need to replay all of that mission maps over again this is a big pain if for example you reach a map where a very specific skill would make clearing the map significantly easier but you aren clairvoyant and didn bring a protector with that skill so you need to go back redo your team and then play all the way back up to the point you left off atone of the features hinted at in the title of cart of darkness is finding the hidden powerup game cartridges these games feature goofy names based on wellknown old titles and grant your protectors extra powers when equipped it a nifty feature but even it affected by the grind cartridges only reach their full power after gaining several levels in battle and finding them in the first place requires figuring out bizarre arbitrary goals on each map it is a funny callback to some of the ridiculous things old games made you do to find secrets but rather annoying in practice if you want to find and upgrade all of the carts and sometimes things in gotta protectors get way too hectic i failed maps because i didn see that i accidentally pushed lola out of the safe walls of her castle while trying to keep a massive onslaught of enemies and their magic and projectile attacks at baybut even with its flaws gotta protectors is fun challenging and unique in both singleplayer and online or couchcrew multiplayer its mix of goofy humor oldschool visuals and music and engaging gameplay makes for a game that difficult to put down even when you screw up bigtime and lola screaming annihilates everything you be eager to hop back in with what you learned about the map and try again to get it right this time there nothing else out there quite like gotta protectors and you do well to enlist in

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/everyone-is-playing-switch-sports-volleyball-wrong-and-i-hate-it/1100-6503080/,switch sports is a whole lot of fun especially volleyball at long last i can finally play my favorite sport in the comfort of my own home without facing the stigma that comes with dropping hours into dead or alive xtreme why is it so hard to make a good volleyball video game that isn about women wearing the smallest swimsuits possible that said i wish my teammates better understood what they were doing when playing the game specifically when it comes to blockingso here i am on my hands and knees because you failed to help me stop the ball and that means i had to dive for it begging for y to start read blockingusing data pulled from observations of your opponent to limit how well a spiker can hit the ball as opposed to outright stopping it it will make life so much easier for your partner when they preparing to receive the ball and bump it upnintendo puts a greater level of importance on blocking jumping up to stop a spike than it should given how it framed volleyball in switch sports volleyball mode traditionally twoversustwo volleyball is played on a beach where sand balances out the lack of available receivers defending players responsible for bumping up the ball so that it can be set by restricting a spiker jump height and thus the available places they can easily hit the ball to switch sports however opts for indoor volleyball which is traditionally played threeversusthree or sixversussix getting more bodies on the court means there are more receivers covering more ground to counter a powerful spikeras nintendo has blatantly ignored this pattern in favor of creating its own style it means only one receiver has to cover the entire back half of their side of the court putting a ton of pressure on the blocker to be at all of the time instead of two receivers covering the left and right sides of the court a blocker needs to cover one allowing the receiver to focus on the otherthe easiest way to do this is read blocking in volleyball there are a ton of different types of blocks each specializing in stopping a different type of spike switch sports doesn include that level of variety but that okay since there are only a few types of spikes you need to block as far as i can tell switch sports volleyball has two types of blocks read blocking and guess blocking too many people do the lattera guess block is pretty much exactly what it sounds like you guessing where the spiker is going to send the ball and attempting to stop them no matter what removing any need for the receiver to do anything in switch sports volleyball the game automatically moves you when you blocking to be in front of the spiker it essentially the game guessing for you putting you in the path of the most likely attackif your opponent is only jumping and swinging guess blocking works just finemore often than not you be able to rely on the game predictive movement to stop inexperienced players but it falls apart the second you go up against an intelligent spiker say the other team is setting up and their spiker is approaching from your leftthe game will usually pull you over to the left to be in line with the spiker technically you in a position to block but the spiker still has options to get the ball around you if the set is good the most logical path especially if they are righthanded is to spike across to the corner behind and to the right of you this is called a cross shot but they can also hit to your left straight down the line to the corner behind and to the left of you this is called a line shotin this scenario the receiver behind you has to cover pretty much all of the court except for what directly behind you that hard though not impossible and it easy to score against i been the spiker plenty of times in that situation and simply aimed for whichever corner is opposite the opposing receiver to make them scramble for it even when they do manage to get it the bump is typically not perfect meaning the opposing team can pull off the necessary nice bump set spike combo pattern to pull off a powerful attackyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenterwith only two people per side a greater emphasis is put on the blocker to limit a spiker options and in volleyball speak that generally means read blocking traditionally read blocking would mean reading a set to determine who is spiking and then reading the spiker to figure out how they going to hit but since there only ever one hitter you don have to do all thatyou know which player to go block right from the getgo and should just move into position as early as possiblelet go back to that aforementioned situation where a spiker is approaching from the left side giving them the option for a cross shot to the right corner or line shot to the left corner unlike when you on offense in volleyball you actually have control over where you go on defense whether blocking or receiving using the control stick you can pick where to go instead of relying on the game automatic movement so read the situation and respond accordinglyin this case the best option would be to deny the larger areathe right side where there more court for the spiker to hit to so instead of lining up with the spiker stand a bit to the right of them their left and jump on the hit now the spiker is limitedthey can still go right but they now spiking right into your block so committing to the smaller area the left corner is actually a smarter option but because it a smaller area it easier for a receiver to cover on their own in this instance a receiver needs to know to use their thumbstick to move to the backleft corner as relying on the game automatic movement will probably keep you on the right side which the game would figure as the logical placement for the spiker attackthere a good chance in this situation that you won actually get a block and that okay the point of read blocking is not to necessarily block the ball if you do though that great but to instead best defend your side of the court if you just try to guess block you trying to defend on your own and if you miss that means the receiver behind you has to defend on their own but if you read blocking and your teammate moves into position in response to you then together the two of you can form a wall to defend most of the court is it perfect of course not no defense in volleyball is foolproof but your chances of stopping the ball will rise if you use read blocking to force the attacker into committing to the attack you want them to dogranted this will take practice read blocking isn easy whether in real life or in a video game as there are more factors to consider beyond the simplistic setup i provided for instance if your opponents pulled off a perfect nice bump and set combo and then the spiker begins approaching from the left that means a perfectly timed spike will see a strong attack coming from the left side in that case the ball is going to be coming at you pretty fast so it might actually be better to read the situation and block the straight line shot to the back left corner it does mean your teammate has to cover the much larger areabut the ball now has to travel a longer distance going across the court towards the back right corner in comparison to going straight ahead to the back left corner and the longer travel time through the air translates into an additional halfsecond for the receiver to reactlook at the switch that you playing this game on you see what i talking aboutput switch sports on standby for a second and pull your console out of its dock you see that the distance from the top left corner of the screen to the bottom right corner is longer than the top left corner to the bottom left corner so forcing a spiker to hit diagonally can be a strategy too heck maybe it for the best if you notice your opponent is lefthanded remember most folks will automatically spike across their body it an easier arm movement so in the instance where a lefthanded person is approaching from the left forcing them to hit towards the right corner is an awkward enough movement that they might actually mess up the timing of the spike making your teammate job as the receiver even easierthat all read blocking isgiving your teammate the best possible chance to receive the ball it noticing how well the other team received your team spike how well the other team set the ball where the spiker is approaching from when the spiker is jumping and what hand the spiker is hitting with and then reacting as best you can while trusting your teammate to be there after you done all those mental gymnastics it not nearly as glorious or satisfying as simply blocking an opponent attack and shutting down their spike but if you have a supportive teammate they thank you for read blocking and making their job a bit more feasibleof all the sports in switch sports volleyball mode is one of the most involved even featuring mechanics that the game doesn include in the tutorial like did you know you can dive for a ball while receiving by wiggling the joycon in the direction of a falling ball allowing you to potentially get a few extra inches of distance at the cost of a subpar bump or that you can aim your spike at the tips of a blocker fingers sending the ball ricocheting off their hand and out of bounds getting you the point or putting the opposing receiver so far out of rotation if they manage to chase it down that they might not be able to get back in time to spike and then there my favorite the spiker actually sets the tempo for hits not the setter so if you spiking and jump before the ball even reaches the setter it allows you to do a quick spike where your teammate flings the ball right at your hand potentially giving you the chance to spike the ball before the blocker has even left the ground it a great way to surprise your opponent during an especially long rally if you and your teammate have been doing slower tempo attacks a few times in a row and lulled your foes into following a rhythmbut all of that doesn matter in the face of the importance of read blocking if you playing switch sports volleyball and you going online please commit to practicing and utilizing read blocking it makes things so much easier on your teammate getting a block that leads to a point always feels cool but reading your opponent well enough to force them into doing the hit that you want them to do giving your teammate a second or two more to get the ball up can feel just as rewarding and is honestly just a more reliable way to win,Everyone Is Playing Switch Sports Volleyball Wrong And I Hate It,en,561.0,Positive

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/road-96-review-i-would-walk-500-miles/1900-6417866/,petria the fictional country at the center of road is in rough shape throughout the country is gripped by political turmoilnow a moderateleaning candidate is threatening the longstanding regime of a totalitarian dictator while a growing resistance threatens to send the country youth boiling over and into a fullon revolution add to that a growing number of teenagers seeking life outside of the country walled borders and you got a recipe for potential disaster on election day this is what each of road procedural journeys delicately build towards with some strong character writing and entertaining gameplay vignettes even if the central conflict is too reductive with its overall messagingeach episode of road puts you in control of a faceless and nameless teenagerone of many looking to escape petria by making the dangerous journey to its border and attempting to get over its oppressive wall you given the choice between three teens before a run each with different starting attributes that dictate how much cash you initially have on hand your overall energy and your distance from the border the first two are the most important to consider as cash can open numerous interactions throughout the runsuch as purchasing food bribing cops or paying off smugglerswhile energy governs whether you able to continue a run at all or not if your energy reaches zero you pass out on the side of the road and await arrest sending your teen to a labor camp and ending your run immediately you replenish energy by resting or buying food while completing small odd jobs or just scavenging for money so finding a balance between the two is crucial to a successful runeach run is segmented into short vignettes which take place in numerous locations such as trailer parks truck stops or within a car you decided to hitchhike in the pointandclick nature of the gameplay makes each one relatively breezy to get through letting you focus on the conversations with characters you select responses in conversations using the game firstperson view which isn always the most elegant way to choose the option you want when a character you replying to is moving a little erratically choosing the tone of your responsewhether it in support of the violent actions of the resistance or aligned more with the need for people to vote for the opposition for examplehas a direct influence on how long these vignettes can last depending on which characters are present and in some extreme cases can end a run prematurely when you clash with someone dangerous it means that choosing your words needs to be more measured than just picking whatever aligns with the role you choosing to play in the overall story so each interaction has a suitable sense of tensionoutside of dialogue short minigames are peppered into each vignette which do a good job of breaking up the monotony of conversations many of these are entertaining distractions such as highly engaging games of air hockey short and chaotic traffic dodging sequences and straightforward environmental puzzles that can be solved with a nail gun that has a satisfying kickback to each shot these do repeat when you start closing in on the later stages of the game but considering each one is shortlived and equally fun they never wear out their welcomethe most important interaction in each vignette takes place between yourself and road core supporting characters whose stories are deeply intertwined with both the history of petria and its future although you only interact with each of these characters one at a time you quickly start putting together how the stories of some of these characters intersect even when you not around this creates a central narrative thread that satisfying to piece together even if each character isn necessarily aware of each other each character also features their own musical theme that helps you identify when they will appear each track available as a collectible cassette you can find around the world is fantastic blending in beautifully with the periodappropriate mix of synthpop and southern rockchoosing your words needs to be more measured than just picking whatever aligns with the role you choosing to play in the overall storythese character interactions are where the crux of road political story plays out with each one having different opinions on the current state of the nation and more importantly what the correct course of action for its future should be a beefy truck driver that is introduced early as a core member of the resistance and lovingly refers to you as youngblood during each run works through feelings of guilt over a previous failed revolution attempt and the subsequent loss of life while also trying to temper the growing frustrations of the resistance group he leads sonya sanchez the game take on a boughtout journalist that benefits heavily from the current regime has an overthetop energy and lashes out at any suggestion that the current government is bad while taking pride in duping her viewersthe overlap between each of these characters does create some of road best moments one of the most engaging narratives revolved around three main characters the aforementioned truck driver a genius programmer looking for his biological parents and a cop that takes issue with the severity of the force they expected to employ while these three initially seem entirely unrelated to one another you quickly get insight into conversations between the trio without each one being aware of who they talking to at the time letting you fill in the blanks with what they might feel should they become aware of the connections it builds a strong emotional attachmentnot only to their individual stories but to the trio eventual fate which is dictated heavily by how you handle each of your individual interactions with them over the game eight unique runsdisappointingly this isn the case across the entire cast of characters however jarod a homicidal taxi driver using murder to process the loss of his daughter has some whiplashinducing changes of character when the story necessitates it he seems fine with burning you alive in a van during one run but quickly throws away his entire vendetta against another character after eavesdropping on a conversation that is meant to be heartfelt which itself comes across as a strange change of character from the person having the conversation it annoying to follow these threads intently throughout each run only to have them conclude so poorly in some cases but thankfully it mostly relegated to the least interesting handful of characters those deeply tied to the overall story of petria have enjoyable payoffs which doesn entirely make up for the missteps but certainly softens the blow somewhatwhile the smaller stories of each of road characters are mostly captivating to follow its overall narrative is harder to take seriously it never manages to get past its surfacelevel observations and statements which make it clear that the current dictator is just evil for evil sake and that the opposing candidate adorned in blue marketing is the single answer to all of petria problems road expects you to just accept that petria has a massive portion of teenagers seeking to escape its borders often encouraged by their parents while also believing that most of its population is still set on keeping the current regime in power when children are being sent to labor camps to work until death there no defined demographic that is being oppressed which might account for the discrepancy nor is there any explanation as to why the government would go to great lengths to prevent teenagers from escaping just to systematically incarcerate or kill them anyway there a narrative disconnect that oversimplifies the political dynamic in a twoparty structure while also dialing up the extremities of each party to nonsensical degrees in turn this makes it challenging to become invested in the overall conclusion to the story which is far too neatly tiedup to leave a lasting impressionit a shame that road great character writing is stuck within such restrictive framing even if many of its most memorable dialogue sequences only work given that the premise has allowed for this assortment of personalities to intertwine it doesn mean that there no reward for seeing some of them through but if you hoping for an introspective look at the complexities of revolting against an oppressive regime then road doesn deliver on that front it is however an enjoyable pointandclick adventure outside of that with a neat procedural twist that keeps each of your escape attempts entertaining with dialogue choices that feel purposeful and entertaining minigames to keep things varied,Road 96 Review - I Would Walk 500 Miles,en,623.0,Positive

bested your first demigod and claimed a great runea major step on the path to becoming elden lord that solidifies your place in the roundtable hold and opens up more of the lands between to you next we head north to liurnia of the lakes the land beyond stormveil castle and home to the academy of raya lucaria where sorcerers learn mystic arts that are separate from those taught by the adherents of the golden orderin liurnia you can learn a lot more about the demigod children of radagon and rennala as well as major parts of the history of the lands between and pursue one of the game endings it also opens the path to the east allowing you to reach leyndell the erdtree capital and mt gelmir here everything that happens as you make your way in liurnia to claim a second great rune and what you need to know about the sorcerers who have taken control of it of course you going to find spoilers in this article as we try to explain the story of liurniafor more context on the history lore and story of elden ring check out our other explainersmore deep dives into elden ring storythe lore and history of the lands betweenthe frenzied flame and the game bleakest ending explainedentering the roundtable hold with godrick great rune inhand makes you a fullfledged member of the hold opening the door to the chamber at the back of the roundtable main chamber to you there you meet the two fingers and discover that name is not a metaphor the two fingers are in fact two giant fingers literally almost half of a massive hand in a small throne room beside the fingers you meet enia a cleric of the golden order known as a finger reader her job is to interpret the movements of the fingers and convey their wisdom to others and she can use their power to convert the remembrances you claim from great enemies into special weaponsmeeting the two fingers gives you a few hints about what going on behind the scenes in the lands between the towering fingers serve the greater will and seems to be responsible to some degree for the guidance of grace one wonders exactly what up with the fingers however they seem strangely rotted for one thing and venture out to the divine towers to empower your great runes and you find more fingersnot just rotting but dead for another what makes their wisdom worth following and finally how do you know the two fingers are telling you the truth about what the greater will wants how do you know the finger readers are telling you the truth about what the fingers wantwith all that bouncing around in your head you can head back to sir gideon ofnir who gives you a little more information about the demigods you hunting gideon also wishes to become elden lord and he been advancing his way toward that goal by gathering as much information as he can about what happening in the lands between he give you intelligence about the locations of several of the great runes and their bearers but there a lot he wants to learn from you if you tell himwith both the two fingers and gideon you might want to make note of the potential agendas of the people you interacting with in the roundtable hold not everyone is sharing all their information with you and you shouldn expect everyone to tell you the truth pay attention because others have agendas you might not be aware ofgideon will point you toward potential targets and if you follow the lay of the land your next stop is liurnia of the lakes the region north of limgraveliurnia is a huge marsh more than it is a lake and warfare has seen its towns sink into the water and mud beneath in addition to the battles of the shattering the nation has also suffered significantly from civil war there are two major political forces in liurnia that have been at odds and the result is that there are two major players a demigod and a shardbearer holed up in their respective fortifications but for very different reasonsat the center of liurnia is raya lucaria a sorcery academy while the north is the home of the carian royal family in caria manor these are two separate powers although they were once allied the carians are the traditional royal family of liurnia and rennala the last of the carian royal line is a powerful sorcerer and formerly the head of raya lucaria but a lot has happened since thenhistorywise liurnia is where you first start to learn about radagon and some of the events that led to the golden order taking over the entirety of the lands between and the politics that would break it apart during and after the shattering back when marika was chosen by the greater will to become a god the lands between were home to several nations of several different kinds of people liurnia home of sorcerers who valued intelligence over faith and drew power from the cosmos to create their magic had monarchs of its own in the carian royals rennala was a powerful sorcerer and champion in her youth and her prowess caused the academy to name her its master in addition to being queen under her leadership liurnia resisted the golden order which prompted marika to dispatch her own champion radagon at the head of an army still the carians and their sorceryadept knights held back the golden order forces despite much smaller numberseventually the stalemate was broken not by military force but by marriage radagon and rennala fell in love and so liurnia came under the golden order when the two were married that would have brought the country and its sorcerers under marika control and there mention that despite the sorcerers aversion to faith sorcery was allowed to exist under the golden order radagon and rennala would go on to have three very important children rykard radahn and rannithe state you find liurnia in is very different than the height of its power however after marika and her forces won all of their wars the first elden lord godfrey was stripped of his grace and sent out of the lands betweenhe his future descendants and the warriors he took with him would become the tarnished after that for some reason radagon left rennala and returned to leyndell to marry marika and become second elden lord the ins and outs of that decision are murky especially because radagon and rennala seemed to be very much in love even as they parted radagon left rennala with a great rune in the form of an egg made of erdtree amber the great rune of the unborn using the rune people can be reborn through rennala power although this process does not seem to be particularly uh goodthe children born anew through rennala power are frail and shortlived more on that to comeradagon departure was enough to break rennala heart as well as her mind she shut herself up inside raya lucaria and the academy quickly came to realize that she was no longer fit to lead at some point after radagon departure and perhaps during the shattering rennala was imprisoned in the academy great library with raya lucaria and its cuckoo knights turning on caria manor they never managed to capture the manor itself but with rennala broken and locked away raya lucaria effectively controls liurnia at this point such as it isif you head to caria manor you find it heavily protected by vicious magical spells even approaching the manor causes rains of magic to fall down upon you which would have easily shredded any force marching north from raya lucaria head inside and you find that caria manor is mostly abandonedit principally guarded by magical creatures like creeping handspiders and spirits of its former soldiers unlike stormveil castle in limgrave or castle morne on the weeping peninsula there no castellan caring for caria manor in fact there are few people still alive there at allwhat you do find guarding the castle is another magical projection one of a carian knight named loretta if you fight and defeat the projection many of the magical safeguards on caria manor are lifted including the magical attacks on the grounds outside it beyond the manor in the protected land behind it you can find ranni rennala daughterat least in a sense as ranni seems to magically inhabit the body of a doll you find that she still has a few loyalists to the carian royal family in her employ iji a wellspoken troll blacksmith blaidd a halfwolf protector known as shadow who was raised as ranni adoptive brother and seluvis a sorcerer who wears gear suggesting his loyalty to rennala and radagonthough she a demigodwhen radagon married marika all of his children with rennala were elevated to demigod statusranni apparently cast aside her great rune according to sir gideon ofnir thus she not a shardbearer and you can fight her instead you can choose to help her ranni as she eventually explain is an empyrean someone chosen by the two fingers with the potential to be raised to godhood if you throw in with her you can help her with this goal working with her small band of loyalists to advance her interests there a lot more to ranni story which deserves its own rundown but suffice it to say that like the other demigods ranni is making moves toward power she needs help though largely because she mostly stuck in her tower behind caria manor since liurnia is a dangerous place for a carian royal to wander aroundfor the sorcerers of raya lucaria control of liurnia mostly amounts to mining for glintstone a rock used in sorcery dressing like the burger king and studying evermorepowerful spells it doesn seem like much of a stretch to guess that they mean to strengthen themselves to resist any potential conquest by the demigodsall over liurnia you also find the albinauricsartificial beings created by humansspecifically it seems by sorcerers firstgeneration albinaurics look like humans you usually find them crawling around on the ground because eventually their imperfection causes their legs to fail secondgeneration albinaurics are those weird frog folks you find in the outskirts of raya lucaria itself in both cases albinaurics are used as servants and slaves by raya lucaria and to some degree the carian royals and they looked down on as being impure and unnatural untouched by the erdtree grace they are however fullfledged sentient peopleyou discover this if you venture to the village of the albinaurics in the south of liurnia though the albinaurics are a created people some have gained some semblance of freedom from their oppressors perhaps because of the chaos of the shattering and the political turmoil that followed the albinaurics have a town of their own but if you venture here you find them all either dead or crazed they recently been attacked and if you pursue information about the village from a nearby finger reader crone and some of the characters you find there you discover that gideon ofnir sent his loyal thug ensha to attack the village ensha the guy who wearing what looks like rotting flesh for armor in the roundtable hold exploring the town you find a few of gideon remaining forces including an omen killer a specialized warrior dedicated to hunting down the omenlooking carefully you find one survivor in the albinauric village using sorcery to disguise himself as a pot when you discover him this man albus confides in you what gideon men were searching for a piece of a special medallion he managed to hide it from them but feeling his own time is short entrusts the medallion piece to you and asks that you deliver it to an albinauric woman named latenna this item is key to the overarching story of the albinaurics which you can piece together in bits and pieces over the course of the rest of the game the medallion albus tells you about leads to the haligtree a special location far in the north of the lands between and a place gideon wants to reachreturn to the roundtable hold after visiting the albinauric village and you find it deserted despite gideon claim that the hold is a safe place for tarnished ensha attacks you apparently attempting to kill you for the medallion piece he failed to obtain you forced to kill him and after you do gideon apologizes for his enforcer saying ensha got ahead of himself he implies that ensha acted on his own not because gideon ordered you killed for the medallion piece in any case he now short one minion so gideon enlists you as an intelligencegatherer to help him figure out where some of the demigods are located clearly though the guy is a snakeby way of apology gideon offers you some information he gained about the matching piece of the medallion he murdered all those albinaurics to find he doesn know where the second piece is but he knows who will have that information an albinauric woman who escaped ensha and retreated into a cave near the village in the cave you find latenna an albinauric warrior and the same person albus entrusted you to find she managed to get away from ensha during the siege of the village but not before her faithful wolf lobo was mortally wounded in the fighting latenna legs have failed so she has no way of getting around without lobo help show her the medallion and she give you some information about where to find the second half of the medallion in the mountaintops of giants and if you promise to take her there she join you in battle as a spirit ashlatenna story is a short one but has greater implications for what happened to the albinaurics eventually you make your way to the mountaintops where you can learn the albinaurics fate and their reasoning for carefully guarding the medallion gideon would murder them to findthe guidance of grace in liurnia directs you toward raya lucaria so that you can claim the great rune held by rennala inside you find various sorcerers and some albinaurics who seem to serve them also within and around the academy are other signs of its power soldiers marching toward the academy from the north are intercepted by magical projections and multiarmed mechanical marionettes brought to life through sorcery the sorcerers have a lot of power at their disposal it seems and continue to study the stars and the cosmos to increase their knowledge while foregoing faith in the outer godsmoving deeper into the academy you find something else that curious a mechanized contraption on wheels shaped like an iron maiden this is an abductor virgin and you can find a couple of them marauding around the grounds of the academy they have their ties to mt gelmir a volcano north of liurnia where rykard is lord the abductor part of the name abductor virgin is important here as these contraptions are apparently capturing and carrying off albinaurics more on what up with that when we get to mt gelmir in a later portion of this seriesyour path takes you to the great library in the highest part of the academy where rennala is imprisoned and where you fight her as a boss though her children are demigods rennala is notalthough her great rune means she is a shardbearer however when you get there you find that rennala is not really all there her broken heart seems to have driven her mad and she used her great rune egg to create a bunch of creepy scholar children who crawl around and sing to her they similar to albinaurics but don seem to be exactly the same thing these are the imperfect born again creatures rennala can create with her great rune which apparently don live for very long the reborn scholars use magic to attack you and protect rennala but they somewhat easily walloped when you hurt rennala enough however the real defenses protecting her kick in care of ranniin the second phase of the battle you face off against a strange magical projection of rennala at her full power as she would have been during the wars between liurnia and the golden order voiceover dialogue here tells us that this projection is the creation of ranni however so it appears that what you facing is a sort of sorcery security system rennala daughter left in place to protect her mother it seems to kick in automaticallyyou not actually fighting ranni in the form of rennala herewhich is why this battle doesn affect whether you still serve ranni or notdefeating the rennala projection allows you to take her great rune although you don kill rennala you merely leave her imprisoned in both the library and her mind you can use rennala great rune to be reborn yourself if you choose which gives you a chance to reallocate your stats and change your character buildwith a second great rune in hand you actually have the capability to attempt to become elden lord if you so desire but there are more shardbearers to challenge and more great runes to gather including one to the east held by general radahn venturing through the diseased land of caelid however is no easy task read on in part ,"What Happens In Elden Ring?

lumbar support that central to the design of the chair it large and contours to the shape of your back providing support across a larger area the lumbar support is also unique in that it adjustable so you can position it to the shape of your spinethe finetuned customization extends far beyond just the lumbar support you can easily tinker with the angle and height of the chair and its adjustable armrests allow movement in multiple directions so you can find your perfect position it also comes with a detachable head cushion made of memory foam the iskur is made with highdensity foam that molds to your body for optimal comfort and it wrapped in synthetic leather that is both soft and durable as a razer product it unsurprising that it has a cool design the jet black color and green stitching give it that iconic razer lookeven though the iskur is a wonderful ergonomic chair it does have a couple of downsidesboth of which are apparent before you ever sit on it for the first time it also sort of a pain to assemble with screws that are tough to secure and heavier parts than you expect you want to assemble it with the help of another person to avoid as much frustration as possible that said if you are in need of better lumbar support the iskur is as good as it getsthe goodthe badthough not as wellknown as secretlab noblechairs also makes some of the best gaming chairs on the market

look for in a chairthe road warrior also has an adjustable height reclining fully movable armrests and a lightweight but sturdy frame that makes it easy to move unlike most gaming chairs the road warrior has slim wheels that resemble rollerblades it not a feature that is really needed in a gaming chair but it does make the road warrior name make sense the perforated leather on the backrest can be accented in black white blue yellow or redthe goodthe badwhile the more expensive gaming chairs on this list tend to feature premium materials that withstand the test of time you can still get a solid gaming chair without breaking the bank the homall sracer is our favorite gaming chair as one of the most popular gaming chairs on amazon the homall sracer boasts over user reviews and holds a average rating it has the classic gaming chair look and comes in a myriad of color schemes the price ranges from to depending on which style you choose which is roughly half the price of most of the chairs on this listthe homall sracer features most of the adjustability options you expect including full reclining rocking and a movable lumbar cushion however the armrests aren adjustable you sacrifice some comfort with the homall sracer and it likely won hold up as well as the premium chairs we mentioned but it still has a nice ergonomic design and is better than your average desk chair for gaming the homall sracer is the best budget gaming chairthe goodthe badthough gaming chairs have moved toward being designed for desk use over the past decade console gamers who play on a tv may want something different that where floor rockers come in rocker chairs have been around for decades and could be viewed as the original gaming chair and technological advancements have only made them more impressive our pick here is the x rocker pro a fullyfeatured rocker chair with premium padding and a great lookthe x rocker pro has four builtin speakers and a subwoofer to blast ingame music wirelessly and provide a more immersive experience it also features vibration to accompany the audio the x rocker pro is an easy chair to store if you don want it in the center of a room all the time

recliner is another solid option for those looking for a living room gaming chair designed specifically with console gaming on tvs in mind homall gaming recliner is fairly unique in the space it looks much like a conventional recliner though where it separates itself is with the lumbar and neck supports similar to a desk gaming chair homall gaming recliner is focused on comfort for lengthy gaming sessions and the lumbar cushion doubles as a massager with three different modes of vibrationthe recliner certainly maintains the general aesthetics of conventional gaming chairs with its pu leather

badbean bag chairs have long been a gaming staple especially for kids and teens admittedly the average bean bag chair isn the most comfortable option for adults the moon pod however is anything but an average bean bag chair while not technically a gaming product the moon pod absolutely works as a highend living room chair for those who want to sit closer to their tv while gaming especially for those games where the text is annoyingly small it also works well for those who are working from home and need to take a break from their office chair unlike most bean bag chairs the moon pod design is specifically aimed at providing an ergonomic lounging experience the moon pod contours and adapts to your positioning providing back and lumbar support the bean bag which is appropriately shaped like a pod features highdensity beads that are packed to simulate the sensation of weightlessness and it incredibly relaxing to sink intoat however the moon pod is extremely pricey for a bean bag and there are addons that raise the price even more the crescent back pillow which is helpful for additional back support tacks on another to the price for that reason we recommend just getting the base product first to try it out before snagging any addons though we will say the combination of the moon pod and the crescent feels absolutely incredible it worth mentioning our sister brand cnet currently has a promo code that slashes off the moon podthe moon pod itself is also quite large taking up approximately four square feet so you definitely need to have a spot picked out for it or somewhere that you can store it between uses that said this is the most comfortable bean bag chair around and checks all of the boxes for a solid living room gaming chairmore tech picks from

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-in-elden-ring-the-games-story-part-1-limgrave/1100-6502858/,the story of elden ring is expansive and often confusing there a lot of history and backstory to uncover as you journey through the lands between and just getting a sense of the local politics and religion is an important aspect of figuring out what the hell you trying to do it also easy to miss what going on around you especially because so much of the game is optional if you not inspecting every corner reading every item description or talking to every character you meet several times and on several occasions parts of the story might blow right past youif you know where to look though you can learn a lot about what going on in elden ring and how you affecting the game world as you move through it sure you killing a bunch of demigodsbut understanding who they are and why you killing them illuminates a lot about the game itself so we endeavoring to explain the broad strokes of what actually happens in elden ring not just the history that sets up the story this is the story of you the tarnished who would be elden lord cutting a bloody swath through the lands between to stand before the elden ringof course this article will contain spoilers if you not up on the broad lore and history of the lands between you should read our history and lore explainer that talks about everything that happens before you wake up in the church of ambition we also going to avoid going into the quest stories of various characters as those can make your journey in elden ring into a more specific story and while we talk about the ending of the game we only going to talk about the main simple ending and not any of the ones that require completing npc quests to unlock for explainers on those check out our other elden ring story articlesmore elden ring story explainerselden ring story guide the lore and history of the lands betweenthe frenzied flame and the game bleakest ending explainedas the opening cinematic makes clear you one of the tarnisheda person who died outside the lands between but has somehow been beckoned back by grace which seems to be the power of the outer god known as the greater will in practical terms some higher power wants you in the lands between to enact its will in fact there have been lots of tarnished called to the lands between for this job and all before you have failed what exactly you meant to do however isn clear and you hear a whole lot of different interpretations from other characters along the wayafter being immediately accosted and likely killed by a boss a grafted scionmore on that thing later as is the way of soulsborne games you awaken in the lands between proper seemingly helped along by a strange horse and a shrouded woman leaving the tomb you meet a strange man named varre who gives you a quick rundown of your deal guided by grace trying to become elden lord but unfortunately he explains you maidenless unlike other tarnished and that probably means you doomed to die still he explains you can at least see the guidance of grace a strange golden light that points you toward whatever your next goal is grace is a manifestation of the golden order the greater willwill or the wisdom of the two fingersit not particularly clear which as things go on you see why that lack of distinction becomes a bit of a problem for tarnished trying to make their way in the lands betweentarnished can see the guidance of grace giving them some divine wisdom as to where they should be going finger maidens are young women who are similarly touched by the servants of the greater will following their own guidance of grace to assist the tarnished in their missions finger maidens closeness to some divine power allows them to channel runespieces of the elden ringinto power for their tarnished buds effectively finger maidens are the means by which you level up in elden ring so the fact that you don have one is a serious problem why you don have a finger maiden is a speculative story for another time but you pass the body of a maiden on your way out of the tomb at the start of the game and it seems likely she might have been yours and varre may have potentially played a part in her deathelden ring is famously open and freein limgrave alone there a huge amount of stuff you can do that has nothing to do with following the guidance of grace eventually though you once again meet up with the woman you saw briefly in the tomb at the start of the game introducing herself as melina she offers to serve as your finger maiden if you agree to help her reach the erdtree she also gives you a whistle that allows you to call torrent the goathorse bud you met briefly before to help you get aroundmelina situation is interesting like a lot of people in the lands between she not actually aliveshe is instead some kind of spirit she also searching for her purpose which she says was given to her by her mother inside the erdtree but which she has forgotten melina has some mysterious higher role in this world but even she isn really sure what it is her journey with you is a big part of the story but it also easy to missyou can learn a lot from her about the gods and demigods by looking for opportunities to speak with her at sites of gracenot long after she first meets you melina will offer you the opportunity to venture to the roundtable hold a special usually neutral location where tarnished gather and can rest in safety the hold is something of a strange location one to which you cannot physically travel which gives it an otherworldly quality tarnished have seemingly been meeting here for years as they unsuccessfully quest to become elden lord a few warriors are still scattered about even though most have lost the ability to see the guidance of grace by this point one tarnished seems to be the de facto leader of the roundtable hold sir gideon ofnir nicknamed the allknowinggideon has little patience for you when you first arrive suggesting that so many tarnished come through the lands between and the roundtable hold that he given up treating any with respect before they proven themselves in battle this implies that most tarnished never amount to much but you do get a bit of a rundown about your goals in the lands between the quest of the tarnished is to try to repair the broken elden ring and thereby become elden lord to do that they need at least some of the great runes held by the remaining demigods in the lands between that means that to claim those great runes you have to face those demigods in battle since they not going to part with their power willinglyback in limgrave your next logical step is to follow the guidance of grace toward the location to which it is directing you and with this new information you now have a better handle on where the guidance is sending you stormveil castle the lord of the castle godrick is one of the shardbearers you searching for godrick is a demigod who claimed a great rune so the guidance of grace is directing you to invade the castle and take it from himbefore you reach godrick or even stormveil proper though you run into another major boss and possibly the first you fight in the game at all margit the fell omen a great champion of the golden order margit fought in the shattering in service of leyndell the mounted night cavalry bosses you can find around the lands between at night once served himmargit seems bent on stopping tarnished in their tracks before they ever get the chance to gain a great rune and make a play for becoming elden lord but he not in service to godrick instead he seems to be planted at the gates of stormveil in service of the golden order that queen marika religion and government as well as her rules of reality margit means to stop you from trying to fulfill your quest to become elden lord because he serves the old regime broken though it may bethis is particularly interesting because as time goes on you learn more about the omen people margit is a huge towering man with gray skin and horns growing all over his body omen are considered cursed by the golden order and most omen children have their horns cut off when they infantswhich usually kills them there are also fanatics called omenkillers that hunt omen across the lands between which might suggest that the golden order even sanctions their elimination if not some civilians take it upon themselves to eliminate the powerful but supposedly impure omen people however some omen are allowed to live held in the sewers and jails beneath lyendell and while the golden order seems to hate them they sometimes used as soldiers because of their great strength in all cases though the omen are pretty much slaves and prisoners so it notable that margit fights for the golden order that come up again laterdefeating margit opens the path to stormveil proper and with the help of the castle gatekeeper gostocone of the commoners who very much hates his lord godrickyou can make your way through a secret entrance gostoc isn a perfect ally though he expects you to die as you make your way through stormveil and steals your runes when you do he even lock you in a room with a deadly banished knight so he can pillage your stuff you can also ask gostoc to open the heavily fortified main gatethough he will advise you against this for good reason regardless of your path after fighting your way through the soldiers of stormveil you can reach godrickinside stormveil you might come across another tarnished named rogier a spellsword rogier will give you some information about godrick and stormveil and later will return to the roundtable hold talking with him later factors into a strange element of the lands between undead creatures known as those who live in death their story and rogier as well as that of others in the roundtable hold concerns godwyn the goldenthe first demigod to ever die we won dive too deeply into rogier story but finding and talking with him is useful in opening up some story avenues in elden ring that we get to lateryou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenteras you wander limgrave you see the results of what godrick has wrought on the place his men rule the south of the lands between crucifying people along the roadways and setting up checkpoints at key locations soldiers stand at these chokepoints waiting to attack tarnished as they cross bridges or pass beneath gatehouses hunting them and preventing them from reaching stormveilit pretty to easy to infer that godrick is holed up in stormveil castle hoarding his great rune aligning his troops to make sure no one can come for him we get some of the backstory that suggests why this is godrick kind of sucks speak with kenneth haight who claims to be the lord of a stronghold called fort haight and the rightful ruler of limgrave and he tell you about godrick true character that godrick sneaked out of leyndell during the shattering among the women to avoid the other demigods that he hid from general radahn rather than engage the demigod in honorable combat and that he insulted another demigod malenia and then begged for mercy upon getting walloped by her so it sure looks like he hiding in stormveil afraid someone else will come to take his great rune when you actually enter the castle you see more evidence of this as almost all of godrick soldiers are set up in the courtyard manning artillery and facing toward the main gate in case anyone threatens to enter the castleon the way to stormveil you learn more about what godrick is actually doing in the castle he hiding but he also trying to strengthen himselfhe desperate to be taken seriously and respected by the other demigods on the road north to stormveil you might stop by stormhill shack and discover a young woman named roderika who tells you that she was with a group who of tarnished who ventured to stormveil only to be grafted that the fate that has befallen a number of warriors who have tried to take on stormveil if they can even reach the stronghold in the first place godrick soldiers patrol limgrave searching for more tarnished to capture and carry back to the castle for graftingwhen you eventually meet godrick you learn what grafting is all about the lord has literally grafted the limbs of other people onto his body hoping to take their strength into himself godrick is covered in extra arms and legs and stormveil is full of dismembered bodies from all the people the lord has maimed tortured and murdered in order to make himself more powerful you also run across a few enemies called grafted scions in the lands between who seem to be both children and grafting experiments recall that the first boss you faced in the church of ambition was a grafted scion that suggests that godrick expecting tarnished to come for him stationed one of his gross experiments right at their entry point to the lands between to stop them before they could become a threatduring the fight godrick uses grafting right in front of you claiming the head of a dead dragon and using it in place of an arm this is another nod to his ancestors godwyn the golden godfrey son and the firstborn demigod child of marika famously defeated the dragons who once controlled the lands between godwyn was actually so beloved and so impressed the dragons that more than one of them befriended him in fact godrick of course is chasing the glory of his bloodline and trying desperately to make it his own but even while forcing a dragon to be part of his actual body he can stand up to the measure of his forefathers and you kill him and take his great runegodrick defeat opens up the way through stormveil which leads north to the next section of the lands

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/teardown-review-came-in-like-a-wrecking-ball/1900-6417871/,everything the light touches in teardown is primed for you to destroy whether it heavily plastered brick walls or fragile wooden sheds teardown gives you a variety of tools to make blowing up each little pixel a delight as you tear your way through its handful of carefully crafted playgrounds it a game filled with inventive ideas and a satisfyingly simple premiseeven if it is hampered down by a campaign that suffers from poor pacing its premise thankfully has enough depth to it that makes teardown a destructive sandbox toy that is enticing to return to frequentlyacting as a highly soughtafter demolitions expert your journey through teardown campaign takes you across the game nine maps and peppers them with a variety of objects that drive its mayhem you mostly going to carry out intricate heists although the criteria for success does change from mission to mission one might challenge you to steal several computers that are all hooked up to an alarm system while another revolves around destroying a variety of expensive cars by finding ways to dump them in water mostly however the objectives supplement a familiar pattern of play create a route through the map using your destructive tools so that you can carry out the heist before the alarms that you will trigger summon security to your position your limited movement speed and the labyrinthine maps ensure that you can just brute force your way to a solution without carefully thinking about the route you making between objectives while the tools at your disposal methodically limit your options to create engaging environmental puzzles to solveyour ability to destroy each stage is limited by the tools you have you start with just a sledgehammer and fire extinguisher making it easy to break through wooden doors and put out fires but limiting your ability to charge through brick walls as you progress you unlock more powerful tools and weapons including explosives rocket launchers shotguns and pipe bombs each one has a limited number of uses forcing you to carefully consider how you utilizing each one in the context of your objective it consistently entertaining to just blow holes through walls with a shotgun or bring down a small office a few floors with wellplaced explosives or mapspecific construction vehicles with teardown superb physics letting you carry out your delicate planning with consistent and repeatable resultsit is disappointing however that the pace at which these new tools get handed out is so slow for the first half of the campaign while it does allow you to learn some of the intricacies of how teardown systems work without being overwhelmed it does severely limit your ability to tear maps apart in entertaining ways while also preventing campaign objectives from changing too drastically despite the underlying objectives being altered slightly between mission most of the first half of the campaign sticks strictly to its structure of paths between items and building a hasty escape route there only so many times that can stimulate your destructive creativity without enticing you down similar repetitive pathsthis is even more evident once you start reaching teardown far more interesting campaign objectives many of which recontextualize the familiar maps in exciting ways attack helicopters and offensive robotic security cards add a stealth twist to the destructive action turning the formerly flexible planning phase into one with more tension to it others like a mission where you must contend with a growing tornado or another where you need to prevent a lightning storm from igniting buildings and triggering a fire alarm expand teardown mechanics even further shifting the focus away from destruction and more towards preservation it helps the overall pacing immensely but feels as though it comes so far into the campaign that you might have already grown too bored by the repetitionoutside of the structured campaign teardown becomes more of a sandbox toy that can be just as rewarding as its best missions to tinker with a freeform sandbox mode gives you all the tools available in the campaign with unlimited ammunition and all upgrades unlocked letting you wreak havoc on any unlocked maps without strict alarms or objectives in place teardown meticulous destruction can be admired more closely letting you enjoy how its systems interact the way fire propagates through flammable surfaces before being snuffed out with the thick smoke of an extinguisher looks surprisingly detailed given teardown blocky presentation light shafts flood into interior environments with convincing detail once you demolished a wall or two to create a new entrance providing a good example of how handsome teardown can look when you slowed down to take it all in it fun to have all of teardown restrictions stripped away but it also not something that will likely keep you engrossed for hours on enda separate challenge mode offers additional game mode types that you can play in maps you unlocked through the campaign these are mostly fun but shortlived distractions giving teardown a more arcadelike feel one mode called mayhem gives you unlimited access to all your tools and gives you just seconds to create as much voxelbased destruction as you can another named hunted has an armed helicopter invade a map as you scurry around trying to pick up randomly spawning chests and stars these challenges can break up the monotony of the campaign early on even if you still confined to the same handful of maps you unlocked there but there not a lot of lasting appeal to them after a few dips in especially without any cooperative or multiplayer aspectwhat does have the potential to prolong teardown replayability is its already bustling mod scene the game tight integration with steam workshop makes importing usercreated maps and assets incredibly simple with some offered as official mods through the game main menu directly there are wholesale recreations of maps from other games to those from pop culture carefully reconstructed for you to then take apart entirely new weapons are available too the game launch trailer has a glimpse of a lightsaber and that just the tip of the iceberg which also have their own destructive properties that you can apply to each of the game different material types it just fun to experiment in these worlds again emphasizing the teardown strengths as more of a creative and fun toy than that of an engrossing singleplayer adventureteardown greatest strength then lies in its underlying premise the ability to jump into highly reactive maps with an assortment of fun tools to tear them apart remains as entertaining now as it was when i first started playing and the chaotic nature of its physics are a consistent source of joy it a pity that the campaign fails to leverage this well in its first half exacerbated by a slow trickle of new objectives and tools to use these help expose the smart design that teardown has from the start which only really becomes evident much later in its campaign if you can get past that or if you dive into the bursting modding scene there a lot of cathartic mayhem in teardown that will likely keep you coming

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-story-guide-heres-the-lore-and-history-of-the-lands-between/1100-6502537/,the story of elden ring is a broad confusing onelike the elden ring itself it fractured made up of tiny pieces as its different characters serve a variety of masters and enact their own plans even as you play it you might find yourself lost as you interact with other tarnished and hunt down demigods in an attempt to become elden lord heck it not even especially clear most of the time what terms like elden lord and elden ring even meanwe been poring through elden ring lore for weeks now piecing together its vast and complicated backstory and the motivations of its many characters to get a sense of what happening in the game the story of your tarnished character is to fight through the world and try to gather great runes to become elden lordbut that simplified explanation belies the fact that you taking part in the war between various political factions and a bunch of nameless gods all of whom are vying to control the lands between the fate of reality itself in this place hangs in the balance and if you successful in your quest you can choose how to reshape the worldyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing elden ring lore trailerthere a lot of granularity to the story of elden ring but these are the broad strokes of what happening what happened before your arrival why you come to the lands between what you trying to accomplish and who trying to stop youmore deep dives into elden ring storythe frenzied flame and the game bleakest ending explainedlike the dark souls games and demon souls your relationship with dying is at the center of elden ringand actually it informs a lot of what happening in the world in the lands between a strange place beyond the fog the very structure of reality is dedicated by the will of its gods and demigods and one of most important things about the lands between is that marika who is both the land goddess and its queen altered reality to put an end to destined deaththe rule of nature that all things including the gods and demigods will pass awaythe gameplay loop of elden ring like the other soulsborne games sees you facing tough enemies and often dying while trying to fight them either because they stand in your way or because you trying to gain their powerand often both at the same time however because of the actions of queen marika and your role as a tarnished death is somewhat trivial you awaken at a nearby site of grace or stake of marika when you fall in battle enemies respawn when you rest at a site of grace for the same reason death is largely broken in the lands between and most everyone has been alive for a really long time it why you hear the howls at night of the many crucified characters scattered around limgrave why so many enemies look like zombie knights and why a few people seemingly wander around aimlessly or dig at the ground as if they lost their minds as in dark souls a lot of people seem like they been alive so long that their wits and intellect have failed themwhen people do die their souls generally return to the erdtree the big golden tree at the center of the world that both the primordial source of life and now the major component of the elden ring and the golden order there seems to be some kind of eternal life or resurrection possible through the erdtree although it not super clear what going on there the fact that souls physically return to the erdtree rather than ceasing to exist or being destroyed is why elden ring includes so many ghosts as well as gameplay elements like spirit ashthere are a lot of souls floating around returning to the erdtree is also why you enter so many catacombs dungeons that end with a boss room full of erdtree roots the proximity makes it easier for the souls to get where they goinginto this world come the tarnished a name for people who were once from the lands between but who were exiled long ago heavily implied to be descendants of godfrey ne hoarah loux the first elden lord who was expelled from the lands an age or more agothough the direct lineage and connections here are never made explicit after the events that are laid out in elden ring opening cinematic the tarnished who had died in the outside world were beckoned back to the lands between to compete to become elden lordthe fight to become elden lord your ostensible goal throughout the game seems strange at the outset of your journeya lot of people ask you or tell you that that what you trying to do but you basically just wake up in the lands between with no idea why you there that because the role of elden lord is extremely powerful and important with a lot of people and forces hoping to use that role or whoever earns it for their own ends and a lot of those ends have to do with how death works or doesn within the world a number of people want to change the role of death in the world of the lands between and they need the power of the elden ring and the elden lord in order to make that happento understand the whole deal of the elden lord you have to understand how reality in the lands between work and how it is ruled over by marika and her family who are both godlike beings and the equivalents of feudal kings queens and lordsfirst up there the elden ring a magical object that governs the rules of reality in the lands betweenit that gold thing on the title screen when you boot up the game the ring is made up of great runes that seemingly govern different elements of the world in removing the rune of death marika was able to change how death worked in her kingdom the elden ring isn native to the lands between though it was sent to the world by the greater will a cosmic force known as an outer godthe greater will exists somewhere far away from the lands between so to exert its uh will it has emissaries and agents marika is one of those agentsshe was originally of a people from outside the lands between called the numen emissaries of the greater will the two fingers chose marika to become an empyrean a person who could be elevated to godhood and serve as a vessel for the elden ring marika fulfilled that purpose and eventually became a god so at the top of the hierarchy is the greater will then marika and the elden ring then seemingly the two fingers then the demigods who are marika children and stepchildrenwhile marika had the power of the elden ring behind her she didn find the lands between empty in fact quite a few people lived there with civilizations and gods of their own they included giants in the mountains dragons who may have been subjects of the greater will before marika and humans as well as various other races scattered throughout the world with control of the elden ring and the rune of death marika established the golden order a sort of church of marika that also encompassed the rules of reality in the lands between and she started a campaign to bring the other civilizations to heel under her monarchy and the golden order for that she needed someone to wage war on her behalfa king to her queen essentially the role of consort to marika was known as the elden lord a person who would wield massive power in the lands between as marika right handfor her first elden lord marika chose a powerful warrior called hoarah loux in his new royal position he was renamed godfrey the golden under marika orders godfrey waged war on the giants and various other races when you get to the mountaintops of giants you find a whole lot of frozen giants there thanks to godfrey he also had children with marika godwyn the golden and the twins morgott and mohggodwyn was apparently marika most favored child in the end and he would go on to fight the dragons even befriending a few thanks to his prowess in battle morgott and mohg however were both omen childrenstrange powerful cursed beings with horns growing all over their bodies the golden order it seemed shunned the omens cutting off their horns at birth a procedure that usually killed them royal omen children weren treated quite so heinouslyinstead morgott and mohg were sent into to live in the jails and sewers beneath marika capital leyndellmeanwhile the campaigns of marika and godfrey were going pretty well and the influence of the greater will spread across the land among the armies they sent out into the world was a champion named radagon who advanced in the ranks and eventually stood as a major leader among leyndell forces he brought an army to bear against one of the countries of the lands between that wouldn come under the golden order purview liurnia of the lakes in liurnia stood the raya lucaria academy where sorcerers trained using powers derived from the cosmos at odds with the power of faith granted by the golden order the country had monarchs of its own the carian royal family and powerful knights who also wielded powers of sorceryradagon and his forces found they couldn defeat the carian soldiers or the sorcerers of liurnia and when he met the carian royal rennala on the battlefield the two fell in love so liurnia came under the golden order governance not through force like the other parts of the lands between but through a marriage alliance between radagon and rennala they had three children rykard radahn and rannieventually though godfrey ran out of people to conquer and for some reason marika decided to take away his title as elden lord she sent godfrey away along with his warriors to live outside the lands between it sounds like this was the origin of the tarnishedmarika intended for godfrey and his warriors to live struggle and die outside the lands between before returning stronger that whole deal is open to interpretation thoughmeanwhile after godfrey was pushed out radagon left rennalaa move that devastated herand returned to leyndell to become marika new consort the second elden lord because of the new marriage rykard radahn and ranni became marika stepchildren and were elevated to the status of demigodsradagon and marika then had two more demigod children together the twins miquella and malenia like morgott and mogh though these last two were also born cursed but in a different way miquella could never grow up forever trapped in the body of a child while malenia was cursed by the scarlet rot a disease that ate at her from the inside despite her immortalitystill despite various curses marika and her family lived and ruled for quite a long time this way raising a society in the lands between and governing as a powerful royal family but slowly things began to shiftmarika had taken over the lands between completely spreading the golden order just about everywhere she was extremely powerful thanks to the elden ring she had a powerful army of soldiers and clerics thanks to the golden order and she had control over the rune of death which meant she could deal death specifically to whoever she chose but she and her family and to some degree everyone in the lands between were otherwise effectively immortalin order to keep the rune of death safe marika entrusted it to maliketh her halfbrother the thing about maliketh is that he both a beastmanhalfwolf and halfpersonand marika shadow there more to the shadow situation but suffice to say that as her shadow maliketh served malika with unwavering loyalty she didn really treat him equally well thoughhis job was to safeguard the rune of death and pretty much nothing else which sounds like he was stuck locked away somewhere with this incredibly dangerous powerone night however someone managed to steal a piece of the rune of death from malekith combining it with some black daggers a group of assassins sneaked into the capital and killed godwyn many were captured or killed as they tried to escape but the damage was done for the first time in history a demigod had been killedthe next part of the timeline is a bit hazy because godwyn death did massive damage to marika and the golden order but it not exactly clear when everything happened as a result of the night of black knives at some point either immediately after godwyn death or some time later seemingly in a fit of grief marika used her hammer to shatter the elden ring that broke the ring up into a bunch of smaller runes some extremely powerful and some not and scattered them throughout the world radagon tried to repair the ring but couldn and marika soon disappeared again there might have been peace for a while but thanks to the destruction of the elden ring things were already falling aparteventually both marika and radagon were missing in action with the elden ring destroyed the golden order started to crumble and a power vacuum was created the various demigods got hold of pieces of the elden ring called great runes giving them even more power some wanted to restore the golden order some wanted to take power for themselves some wanted to change the rules of reality using the elden ring and some had other outer gods to whom they pledged their loyalty the demigods each trying to claim the role of elden lord for their own agendas plunged the entire lands between into a huge civil war called the shatteringthe lands between were quickly sectioned off into small territories each with their own armies there were clashes between several of the demigods culminating in a huge battle between the two greatest warriors among them radahn and malenia they fought on an expanse of sand dunes in caelid but neither could defeat the other though neither of the demigods was beaten their battle had enormous effects on the land thoughit spread malenia disease the scarlet rot all through caelid while decimating both groups of forces the scarlet rot is nasty stuff that has no cure with the ability to eat away at limbs and affect the functioning of the brain radahn was so badly infected with scarlet rot that he lost his mind malenia too was greatly harmed by the sickness she channeled the power of the rot within her in order to match radahn strength and in so doing lost a lot of her will and sense of self as she succumbed to the afflictionafter that massive battle the wars of the shattering died down somewhat but they left most of the lands between in ruins with the demigods unable to beat each other or unwilling to risk being beaten by one another they retreated to strongholds and fortresses with their great runeswhile several of the demigods are currently making their own moves the elden ringwhether they communing with other outer gods trying to grow their power or standing in defense of the old waysthere nobody to break the stalemate between them since no one can claim the elden ring to fix it and the golden order and take leadership in the lands between things are just stagnating in a state of semicivil war nobody dies nobody can win and everything ruinedand that where the tarnished come in called back to the lands between by some strange force they find themselves guided by gracea big golden light only they can see the grace seems to be subordinate to the two fingers and thus the greater will and it pushes tarnished toward hunting down the demigods and claiming their greater runes so they can repair the elden ring and become elden lord basically with the demigods unable to do the job it being outsourced to random warriors you meet so many tarnished in the game because you by no means the first to make this attempt and in fact many of the tarnished you meet have been at this for so long their ability to see grace has faded away you not only coming in at the end of marika long reign to find the lands between mostly in ruins you also coming in at the end of the institutions of the tarnished like the roundtable hold which are also languishingwhile your mission to eliminate the demigods and claim some of their great runes is at the center of elden ring there a whole lot of other stuff happening as well you find a ton of other characters scattered throughout elden ring each of whom is exercising their own plans a lot of people want to become elden lord including most of the tarnished and demigods you encounter some of them will try to use you to accomplish their goalsthe primary driver behind your quest is the two fingers the agent of the greater will usually information about the two fingers and their orders for you would come through a finger maiden these maidens are pledged to their tarnished guiding them to follow the wisdom of the two fingers and serve the greater will they also help you by channeling runes at sites of grace allowing you to increase your power when you start the game maidenless it means that for some reason you didn get a finger maidenand thus unable to increase your abilities you pretty much doomed luckily a strange woman named melina agrees to serve as your finger maiden provided you help her on her own questthe greater will wants you to mend the elden ring for its purposes but while lots of people are competing to become elden lord they don all want to do so because the greater will tells them to there a huge amount of conflict in the lands between because since the shattering the place is pretty much up for grabs the greater will has dominated for eons but other outer gods also exist and their followers are also vying for control a bunch of them are discussed throughout the game if you pursue information about them and their influences are all over the placetake for instance malenia and the scarlet rot once you venture into the areas of the game that concern the rot you learn that it related to a whole rot goddess complete with its own worshipers there also the frenzied flame another outer god that seems diametrically opposed to the greater order trying to enact an age of chaos on the lands between you find more mentions of more outer gods as you go and uncovering their purposes and agendas illuminates more of elden ring world there are also people who want to break free of the control of the outer gods altogetherthere also is a group of demigods known as empyreansthose chosen by the two fingers as candidates to ascend to full godhood just like marika did the rules for how empyreans work are unclear but we know that these characters are meant as potential candidates to serve as successors to marika once someone has been chosen as an empyrean they get a perfectly loyal wolf shadowmarika had maliketh in this role the empyreans we know about are the twin children of marika and radagon malenia and her brother miquella as well as ranni radagon daughter with rennala there also another empyrean we know almost nothing about a character referred to in the lore as the duskeyed queen so there are demigods who want to become elden lord teaming with marika and the golden order factions and cults who want to reshape the elden ring according to their own beliefs and empyreans who might want to become fullon gods themselves and replace marika altogetherthus making your way through the world of the lands between you going to run into a lot of different people who will tell you a lot of different things and integrally some are going to lie to you to get what they want others will try to kill you to take what you have everyone wants to become elden lord and claim the power that comes with it who you choose to help or hinder and what you choose to do with the power you gain along the way is up to youwhat you actually doing in elden ring can be just as confusing as

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-story-guide-the-frenzied-flame-and-the-games-bleakest-ending-explained/1100-6502538/,the world of elden ring is full of subplots and sidequests usually given to you by completely missable npcs who travel around the lands between stopping at various landmarks along the way some of them are the keys to new weapons armor or spells while others will unravel whole layers of lore and ingame mythology that will lead you to alternate endings and maybe change your understanding of your mission as a wouldbe elden lord altogetherthis is certainly the case with the frenzied flame one of elden ring most dense and most easily missed side stories that will walk you down an entirely new path on your quest to the erdtreewhich will even make for some new enemies and some ominous foreshadowing of the future should you choose to see this quest throughso what exactly is the frenzied flame and what does it have to do with elden ring story the answer is a little complicated so strap inand brace for a lot and we do mean a lot of major game spoilers along the waymore elden ring story explainerselden ring story guide here the lore of the lands betweenone of the key components of elden ring internal mythology is the idea of the greater will which is what known as an outer god or an eldritch force that is exerting its influence on the lands between via conduitsregular gods like marika there a lot of finer points and insandouts to being a god outer or otherwise in elden ring but for now its best to understand the outer gods in this story as puppet masters trying to pull the strings of the lands between while also existing firmly outside of the normal concept of realitythe greater will uses marika as a conduit but it also uses monstrous handlike creatures known as the two fingers to communicate at some point in the past it established the idea of the golden order a sort of quasireligious movement anchored by the communication of the two fingers and marika reign that believed in a divine plan or set of rules for all life in fact we even have the names of two of those rules ingame as incantations known as the law of causality and the law of regressionput simply the greater will has a very strict view of how things work and how life must functionand unsurprisingly not everyone is super eager to go along with it especially if they don quite see eyetoeye with those rules one such dissenter is another outer god popularly known as the frenzied flamethe frenzied flame is in essence the exact opposite of the greater will where the greater will instills rigid order and strict laws the frenzied flame instillswell frenzy absolute chaos madness and in the words of some of their faithful a complete breakdown of everything that divides and distinguishesthe greater will may have been the top dog in terms of influence in the lands between prior to the shattering and subsequent decay but it was never without challengers it hard to tell just when or how the frenzied flame began to take root within the population but evidence suggests it been around for a whileand in fact has been actively buried by the greater will loyalists in an effort to keep it hidden and locked away there only one piece of concrete text in the game pointing to any sort of origin found on the incarnation the howl of shabriri which reads it is said that the sickness of the flame of frenzy began with shabriri the most relieved man in all historymore on shabriri in a secondnow while these two are far from the only outer gods in elden ring mythology they seem to be the two most closely related to one another while the greater will uses the two fingers as conduits the frenzied flame uses a creature called the three fingers for itself this could potentially suggest that the two of them are in fact one entity that was bifurcated somehow into two opposing forcesthis is further implied by dialogue later in the game with an npc hyetta who explains all that there is came from the one great then came fractures and births and souls but the greater will made a mistake torment despair affliction every sin every curse every one born of the mistake and so what was borrowed must be returned melt it all away with the yellow chaos flame until all is one again though the possibility for unreliable narration certainly shouldn be discountedso now that the shattering has occurred many of the fingers are dead and the lands between is in a state of extreme decline the frenzied flame is among the many powerful forces trying to make a move to do this it like the other outer gods needs the help of some powerful loyalistswhile the greater will may rely on everyone from tarnished fundamentalists to spurned demigods the frenzied flame keeps things a bit more lowkey in terms of its followers and conduits the first hints of the frenzied flame you likely to find in your adventure are an item called shabriri grapes which despite the name aren fruit at all but rotten eyeballs plucked from the sockets of mostly willing donors looking to give their grapes to maidens you eventually be able to give these grapes to one such maiden a blind girl named hyetta who is on a quest to follow the guidance of a distant light that she can only see once she eaten a grapeoh and yeahshe does think they literal grapes don worry you eventually get to tell her what she eating it doesn go well but doesn change her mind about it eitherhyetta begins her mission believing that she going to become a finger maiden as a servant of the greater will but somewhere along the way decides that she actually better suited to a different power she makes this choice after you feed her a fingerprint grapeyes another eyeballthis time from an invading tarnished warrior who was scorched by the flame of frenzy this tarnished named vyke also drops some items with even more clues talking about how he was once very close to becoming elden lord but ventured deep below the capital where he was burned by the flame leaving finger print marks melted into his flesh and armorvyke himself can be found at a whole corner of the map devoted to the frenzied flame in the northern corner of liurnia where a village has apparently succumbed to the flame influence wholesale they even have a guard tower that will inflict madness on anyone approaching presumably to both guard their little community and grow their numbers it also worth noting that the church within the village is called ironically the church of inhibitionwhich may imply that the flames took root here with some deliberate sense of irony seeing as inhibition is defined as the restraint against expressing an instinct or you know the exact opposite of being frenzied if this is the case it points even more strongly to the possibility of the frenzied flame and the greater will being more than any other outer gods diametrically opposed enemies or rivals a sort of eldritch batman and the joker if you willas opposed to the other big powerful forces around the lands between that seem pretty happy to do their own things or pursue their own goalsthe residents of the frenzied flame village aren the only followers to be found however eventually if you follow the questline given to you by yura a samurai and bloody finger hunter you first meet in limgrave you be able to meet shabriri himselfthe guy who named the grapes and apparently started the frenzied flame fad in addition to the grapes and the incarnation he also has a talisman named after himshabriri woewhich states that he had his eyes gouged out as punishment for the crime of slander and with time the bright flame of the frenzy came to dwell in the empty socketsif you couldn tell the eye theme is pretty prominent hereshabriri doesn seem to have a physical form anymore and instead manifests within the corpse of yura which he apparently reanimated to speak with you and once again impress upon you the importance of venturing below the capital to find a well hidden secret the incentive he offers you is the safety of melina explaining that if you embrace the frenzied flame she won have to sacrifice herself to burn the erdtreeyou have your own fire to get the job doneclearly it a manipulative tacticvyke armor set implies that the same pitch was given to him at some point in the past did he make his choice for his maiden or did some other force lure him with suggestionif you do make the long trek down below leyndell already subterranean system of jails you find a sort of mausoleum filled to the brim with the dead and the nearly dead another thing you likely recognize immediately is that the corpses littering and we do mean littering there hardly any space to walk this place are all merchants yes merchants the friendly guys who you no doubt been meeting along your travels who are always happy to sell you useful stuff the handful that do still survive somehow are playing the simple stringed instrument some merchants carry with thema melody you probably recognizean explanation for this grisly mausoleum can be found in the description of the nomadic merchant finery which reads these merchants once thrived as the great caravan but after being accused of heretical beliefs their entire clan was rounded up and buried alive far underground then they chanted a curse of despair and summoned the flame of frenzymore context about the great caravan and the merchants can be found in some cut content datamined from previous builds of the game where kalethe first merchant you meethad a quest to uncover his own roots leading him to eventually succumb to the flames himselfthere a bit of a chickenegg dilemma happening here with the merchant tribe and shabriri as well both of which seem to be guilty of summoning the flame of frenzy in one way or another it possible that shabriri was part of an ancient merchant tribe himself and that his crimes of slander were punished so harshly because of the strong oral traditions shared by the nomadic merchants around the continentbut there concrete evidence either wayonce you reach the very bottom of the mausoleum you find yourself before a massive fleshy door if you also done hyetta quest up to this point she be miraculously waiting for you to explain that you can only be granted an audience with the three fingers if you remove all your clothesdoing so will allow you to enter and confront the monsterbut don worry it not a fight instead the three fingers will embrace you and sear their fingerprints into your flesh much like they did to vyke before you this will prompt hyetta to offer herself up as your new maiden because melina will promptly abandon you if you decide to travel down this path unfortunately for hyetta however anointing her with the flames she seems to desire so much will ultimately kill herso much for shabriri promise of saving a life huh though given shabriri own ability to bodysnatch corpses and exist without his original form maybe this is all part of the plan we can be certain one way or anotherso what was the point of all this you may askwell once you been anointed with the mark of the three fingers you are locked into a specific ending for the game it doesn matter how many potential mending runes you collected or which other quests you completed if you got the fingerprints on your skin you stuck that is unless you gather miquella needle from defeating malenia which will allow you to remove the mark of frenzy from your body the needle item description specifically notes that it was made to ward off the meddling of outer gods and that it allows one to cheat fate and avoid becoming the lord of frenzied flameif you do not use the needle however you will get the frenzied flame ending which iswell pretty bleak unlike the other endings which include a voiceover announcing the dawning of whichever age you picked the frenzied flame ending includes only ominous silence and the world being engulfed in sickly yellow flameswhich oh yeah have also replaced your head the roaring flames continue uninterrupted until melina assuming she survived the game is given a little cutaway scene where she promises to hunt you down and deliver your destined deathnow melina story motivations allegiances and relationship to various outer gods is a whole other can of worms but it still worth noting that her design has changed slightly in this brief scene her closed eye is now openand visibly blindand her hand is prominently scarredmelina presence in this ending doesn tell us much but it does confirm that despite the absolutely apocalyptic appearance of the world life in some form or another still apparently is able to persist in the lands between that or maybe melina is an extraordinarily special case still there a lot of unanswered questions as to what exactly a world ruled by chaos incarnate actually means and how things would progress under this particular brand of rulesome other frenzied flame adjacent items in the game such as the eye of yelough a rather disgusting looking herb seems to imply that life is definitely possible in some form or another in lands affected by frenzy its description reads grown in lands afflicted by frenzy it used for its painrelieving propertiesthough it also known to be a dangerous intoxicant the name yelough also appears in the name of some ruins found in the consecrated snowfield which may or may not be pointing toward the existence of an entityeither another outer god or another outer godlike creature or perhaps even another name for the frenzied flame itselfthat controls or thrives in frenzy it worth pointing this out if only because melina will warn you in no uncertain terms that the flames of frenzy are basically antithetical to lifemeanwhile the existence of crafting books such as the frenzied cookbook explain that people afflicted by frenzy were discovering new techniques and items to make in desperation and were actually healed by frenzytouched items once they themselves were infectedso what does all this actually mean in the bigger picture it difficult to saythe best we can do is hope for a future dlc that will touch more about the relationships between the outer gods and maybe even something that picks up the threads of

the most famous video games on the planet it easy to forget then that this franchise started as a realtime strategy game before jumping into the mmo realm warcraft arclight rumble the franchise debut on mobile devices is blizzard attempt to bring the warcraft name back to those strategic rootsi had access to a preview build of the game over the last few days and it very apparent that arclight rumble intends to remind us where warcraft startedto resurrect warcraft past all while mixing familiar gameplay with characters and lands built by the mmo lore to create an allnew experienceyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing warcraft arclight rumble handson previewthe premise of warcraft arclight rumble sees coinoperated machines appearing in taverns throughout warcraft setting of azeroth where patrons can use miniature figurines of creatures and heroes to battle against one another in a simplified realtime strategy game players will collect minis create armies and use them in both story battles against the ai and multiplayer matches against other players it a similar approach to how hearthstone uses the tavern as its setting only exchanging cards for minislet be clear about one thing from the jump while war not bad blizzard follows the warcraft series familiar realtime strategy format the depth and complexity of those older games is not here there one resource that needs gathering here as opposed to three for example and it only used for summoning the miniatures in your army as opposed to units buildings and more that said war can serve as a very good primer for the bygone era of warcrafts past as the core gameplay feels a lot like an oldschool rtsthe gameplay loop of war is easy to get a grip on summon units into one of two lanes and watch as they slowly progress up to the main enemy at the top with the overarching goal of defeating that foe outside of the occasional arrow appearing on maps that allows a unit to change lanes as it passes each unit is fully autonomous once summoned units can only be summoned around your base but smaller towers and summoning stones can be captured on some maps allowing you to summon a unit further up on the board units fall into one of three categories each with its own strengths and weaknesses ranged fighters for example are more effective against flying units while melee units are weak to fliersonce units are summoned they will travel until they reach an enemy unit or a boss the enemy boss at the top of the screen will be summoning units as well leading to small skirmishes happening all over the board as troops happen to meet each other in their lane as the battle progresses you need to manage your gold resources efficiently seeing which enemy units are getting close to your base and buying units to counter them while at the same time finding openings in enemy defenses and exploiting them with strong units that can make a push to the top of the boardthere are some unique situations to consider during a battle as well for example there are two units that can attack anywhere on the board at any time chain lightning a spell unit that fires a quick lightning bolt that will damage multiple enemies grouped together and the safe pilot a dwarven pilot that enters the arena by divebombing a designated area if the boss is low on health either of these units can end the battle by themselves as soon as they summoned however in the pilot case if the dive bomb attack doesn kill the boss she usually toast in one or two attacks decisions about what units to deploy and when to roll out your big guns like these present themselves throughout a match and making the right call in an instant is key to victorymissions are carried out on a giant world map with each section of the map holding five battles within them winning all five battles in a region opens the next region until eventually the entire map has been defeated each victory also earns you a skull which acts as a running tally of how many missions you beaten during your playthrough as the tally rises more ways to play are unlocked including oneoff quests where you select a unit to power up fight a battle and if you win the unit gets an extra boost skulls also unlock pvp missions where you can battle against friends and fullon raids where multiple players can gather together against the biggest and baddest enemies in the gameyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenterall of this can be done without paying a single cent of realworld moneythe option to spend money on new units is availablebut war doesn seem to care if you do or not the army i was able to amass just through normal gameplay and ingame currency got me through the majority of the missions i played in one try even if some of those wins were nailbiters that weren decided until the final seconds while you can buy units doing so is more for adding some variety to your army rather than paying to win units purchased aren vastly superior to ones already in your army or those earned with ingame currencywarcraft arclight rumble is not the fullon warcraft iii realtime strategy experience that oldschool feeling however definitely comes through as you play through each mission it may not be exactly the same as the experience but summoning units and attacking central points on a map here in war somehow feels like classic warcraft like getting on a brandnew bike as opposed to the one you replacingit also is a mobile game which in itself carries a sort of stigma but i never felt pressured to spend actual dollars on this game as i played it ingame currency came at a steady rate my units powered up enough that battles never felt out of reach even if i failed and nothing was ever locked away behind a timer as is common with mobile games it may be hosted on mobile devices but a lot of what given the platform a bad rap has yet to show itself in arclight rumbleit take some time to adjust and some may find themselves going back to what they used to but the effort to bring that classic gameplay back to the present is evident using the lore of wow makes a ton of sense too as it lends a familiarity to the game that those only accustomed to the mmo can appreciate it may be a loose fit to some as war framing centers around a gamewithinagame a la hearthstone but the creatures classes and races of warcraft both as rts and mmo are here for fans new and old to appreciatethe press preview build showed off a lot of the content that will be available in an upcoming closed beta testwhich according to blizzard is coming soonso it seems pretty close to the full experience i would like to be able to play around with units before i purchase them with real or ingame currency and i definitely need more exposure to the pvp and raid content we still don know how many players can join a raid at once how robust the pvp is and so on and i feel like those will be strong selling points whether it will ultimately deliver the best of both worlds remains to be seen but as it stands right now warcraft arclight rumble is

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/,the steam page for openworld firstperson shooter postal no regerts markets it as the longawaited true sequel to what been fondly dubbed as worst game ever postal if developer running with scissors goal was to live up to this legacy and maybe even outdo itself then it succeeded with aplomb postal is an abysmal video game it mindnumbingly dull its combat is unenjoyable and lifeless its humor is unfunny and it plagued by myriad technical issues glitches and crashes this is a series that gained traction by courting controversy at a time when pearlclutching over video game violence was world news postal can even claim to be problematic as its bloodshed is notably tame by today standards and any jokes that might be considered offensive are too focused on lazy stereotypes to be considered noteworthypostal basic setup sees the postal dude return along with his loyal canine companion champ after taking a pitstop and forgetting to lock their car the pair vehicle trailer home and all of their earthly possessions are stolen leaving them stranded at the side of the road with nowhere to call home fortunately the fictional town of edensin arizona is located just over the horizon so the unlikely duo head there in search of employment and their stolen itemsmuch like previous games in the series you given a different set of errands to complete each day from monday through friday these are mostly menial tasks like changing lightbulbs in the sewer convincing people to sign a petition and taking on the mantle of a prison guard for the day others are slightly more unusual including one errand that tasks you with launching disillusioned americans over the mexican border using a makeshift catapult the one thing all of these objectives share in commonand i can stress this is enoughis that they aren fun to engage with in any way shape or form this is probably intentional in some cases but to what end postal doesn offer a satirical critique of capitalism or anything like that the game is just designed around dull busywork that proves more effective than any sleeping pills eventually these odd jobs add more and more firefights whether you getting involved in shootouts with border patrol agents or an antibidet cultcombat would add a tinge of excitement if it weren irredeemably bad enemy ai is the main culprit hindering postal firstperson shooting but it far from the only one your foes have a tendency to run toward you in a straight line and suddenly forget you exist or clump together in a group motionless waiting to be killed the postal dude arsenal consists of a familiar assortment of pistols shotguns and rifles none of which feel satisfying to use outside of the revolverbecause it lets you dispatch multiple enemies at once like overwatch cole cassidy all of the weapon types lack the punch and sense of impact you would expect which is partly due to the flaccid sound design and aiming down sights feels overly clunky and stiff in a way not many shooters do the boomerang machete and pigeon mine are the only weapons that veer away from your bogstandard firearms the former lets you chop off limbs by chucking a machete that comes back to you while the latter unleashes a swarm of pigeons that will rip apart any nearby foes in a feathery fury the fournicator sounds like it might be outlandish but it essentially just a shotgun with four barrelsaside from being dumb and outright broken at times the ai also soaks up bullets making most of the weapons feel decidedly weak guns like the alleviate this somewhat but finding ammunition is nighon impossible unless the enemies you fighting are using the same weapon themselves you can purchase ammo at vending machines located around edensin but the game doesn make finding them easy the ingame map is awful being both cumbersome to navigate and lacking in any relevant information the vending machines aren located on the map in fact the only icons that do exist are for shops that often serve no function outside of being set dressing it also rare that you ever find yourself drowning in cash so purchasing just a small amount of ammo will empty your pockets in a hurryas a result of all this i spent most of the game using pistols instead of anything more powerful and each handgun tepidness is only exacerbated by postal habit of artificially inflating the difficulty by throwing dozens of enemies at you at once dying is inconsequential because you don lose any progress and can simply run back to where you were after respawning but slowly killing all of the game braindead enemies is still a monotonous choreoutside of running errands and shooting people you spend the rest of your time traversing the town of edensin the map is large enough that getting anywhere takes a while and postal ensures that getting around is purposefully frustrating you can hop on a mobility scooter to travel slightly faster than the postal dude running speed but finding one isn as easy as you might expect there are plenty of mobility scooter rental stations dotted around the map but hiring one costs which isn an insignificant amount of money charging for these vehicles is especially egregious when they usually disappear if you enter a cutscene or leave them alone for too long so you spend much of your time simply trying to find an abandoned scooter you can commandeer for freeto make matters worse postal is riddled with technical issues particularly when traversing the open world it an ugly and datedlooking game yet even on a powerful pc the frame rate struggles to keep up quicksaving is also a necessity because it constantly crashes to desktop some of these crashes are completely random but there are others i could easily replicate one errand for example takes place in a theme park and tasks you with disabling all of its power boxes i used the game cumbersome platforming to turn them all off without alerting the guntoting staff but the last one was located halfway up a rollercoaster i assumed that riding the was the only way to reach it but every time i interacted with the cart the game would immediately crash the same thing happens with the other two rollercoasters in the park in the end i resorted to shooting the power box which then alerted all of the nearby enemies you can feasibly complete the game as a pacifist but it difficult to do so when the nonlethal approach is brokenthe same is true during your aforementioned shift as a prison guard as you given a baton with an optional nonlethal mode if you don want to mindlessly kill everyone i tried subduing all of the prisoners using this but at some point it stopped having an effect forcing me to switch to a lethal option insteadone of the more frequent issues occurs when entering a new area of the open world there are loading screens between these areas and the game has a habit of placing you inside a mountain when passing through them the only way to escape is by reloading a previous checkpoint but even this doesn always work as intended on multiple occasions i spawned into a broken version of the world where most of the environment had vanished the only thing you can do in this instance is keep reloading until it eventually decides to work even this might not be enough though at one point i managed to load back into the game only to find that i had shrunk down to about two feet tallthere are many more issues besides these there was one errand where the game broke and wouldn let me pick up a missioncritical item on numerous occasions bullets will just stop doing damage and at one point the game crashed at the end of a level and then locked me inside the closedoff environment after i loaded back in it a mess and many of these shortcomings have been present throughout postal tenure on steam early access with no fixes in sightaccording to the developer a number of changes are being made to improve performance and add features these range from new meshes for some characters and subtitles for different languages to a physics pass and improved car models maybe squashing bugs is also on the agenda but at this point it far too late considering their frequency and severitywhenever you not bashing your head against your keyboard because of postal numerous crashes you be doing so because of its awful attempts at humor here a quick rundown of the main topics postal finds hilarious poop male and female genitalia sex animal cruelty and mexicans now i enjoy dark humor and there plenty of toilet humor that tickles my funny bone but this is bottomofthebarrel stuff for the lowest common denominator to give you an example that a lot of shit is the punchline to seeing a lot of shit jeff goldblum already delivered this joke with better execution years agoone errand revolves around hosing away piles of poo to stop a group of mexicans from using them as a secret ingredient in their tacos never mind the fact that mexican food is amazing this is just unfunny racist and trite there another gag where some angry white women run over two mexicansnotice a theme herein their truck just so they can attack me while yelling about cultural appropriation obviously this isn enough to even induce a smirk and is just outright bad most of the humor in postal would still feel at home in postal a game that came out in and it wouldn have been funny then eithereven the most recent pop culture references in the game are still fairly dated with nods to the likes of breaking bad arrested development and twin peaks there one outoftheblue boss fight where you have to kill a peter dinklage facsimile who starts by sitting on a game of thronesesque throne that also a toilet why peter dinklage you might be asking presumably because it easy to change his name to tinklage that and the fact that the series has a precedent for making fun of little people somewhat surprisingly the voice acting is fairly decent for the most part especially considering the material the cast has to work withpostal no regerts is devoid of humor and anything close to approaching fun or engaging mechanics the only things it has in spades are constant technical issues that only compound the game lengthy checklist of egregious shortcomings running with scissors might consider this review a badge of honor considering that the game being bad is seemingly part of the gag but don for a second think that postal even touches the realm of so bad it good there nothing redeemable about this game it a genuinely awful experience that should be avoided at all costs,Postal 4: No Regerts Review - Nothing But Regrets,en,787.0,Negative
gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-in-elden-ring-the-games-story-part-4-mt-gelmir-and-volcano-manor/1100-6503082/,you rolling right along in elden ring having potentially claimed three great runes those of godrick the grafted renalla queen of the full moon and starscourge radahn now it time to head north to the portion of the continent where the erdtree grows the altus plateaulike nearly everywhere else in the lands between there are multiple paths you can take when you reach the plateau once you make the climb to the plateau top you actually find yourself more or less located between two major military forces those of leyndell the erdtree capital in the east and the volcano manor of mt gelmir in the northeventually your road will lead you to leyndell but stopping off at volcano manor gives you a chance to take control of another great rune before making your way to the erdtree to attempt to claim the elden ring volcano manor is controlled by rykard the last of the radagon and rennala children who is actually one of the biggest opponents of the golden order in the lands between in fact making your way to his home illuminates a lot more facets about the golden order past things that happened in the shattering and what awful things are continuing to take place in the lands betweenas always there are spoilers beyond here what you need to know about mt gelmir and the volcano manor and what you discover about the place and the people who choose to live there when you arrivemore deep dives into elden ring storyas you make your way into mt gelmir you start to get an inkling of who rykard is and the horrors he unleashed in his realm with mt gelmir almost right beside leyndell rykard forces posed the greatest threat to the capital and evidence of battles between the leyndell armies and mt gelmir militaryboth completed and ongoingcan be found all the way up the mountain especially early on you find the remnants of leyndell forces pawing through the corpses it almost looks like they eating themthe blackened battlefields surrounding mt gelmir and what left of the leyndell soldiers gives an idea of what kind of warfare rykard raged against the capital some survivors have seemingly lost their minds others have definitely succumbed to madness taking on the burning yellow eyes of frenzy as you climb higher you find some more of the forces that rykard employed against leyndell including a grafted scion and abductor virgins the iron maidenlike contraptions we first spotted roaming in the courtyard of raya lucaria the whole area is covered in blood and ravaged by flame with piles of burned corpses and crucified soldiers revealing that the clash between these two armies wasn just about territory and power but about ideologyrykard ordered the atrocities you see and uses abominations like the grafted scion because they fundamental reflections of the person he is the lord of blasphemyto understand rykard title as lord of blasphemy it important to know his history rykard was previously a devotee of the golden order but he wasn just a believer he was an enforcer rykard former title was praetor and sir gideon ofnir describes him as a justiciar in command of golden order inquisitors praetor is the title of a magistrate while justiciar denotes a political official or judge and putting him at the head of the golden order inquisition suggests rykard was judging adherents for crimes like blasphemy and heresy looking at inquisitors throughout history in our world it probably safe to say that rykard was a man who didn dole out a lot of mercy to the people he found to be guiltywe can get a bit of a sense of what the inquisition might have been like from some of the characters and elements in and around volcano manor when you enter the manor and walk to the right area you be attacked by an inquisitor invader named ghiza this guy wields a gnarly weapon ghiza wheel which is essentially a huge wheel at the end of a staff covered in blades meant not to just cut their victim but to gouge them ghiza wheel isn just a weapon to kill enemies but also an implement of tortureghiza wheel is only carried by this one character but we can see it elsewhere in the world on the abductor virgins that gives us some wider implications about the inquisitors for one thing there were probably a lot of these weapons floating around before the shattering if rykard and his forces didn manufacture a ton of them after the fact it also is possible although speculative that some version of the abductor virgins were previously employed by the inquisitors as implements of torture we know for sure that abductor virgins are inspired by the implements of the inquisition and that suggests torture was a big part of itvolcano manor sits above a town nestled in the caldera of mt gelmir known as prison town it a place filled with torture devices and prison cells suggesting that inquisitors would have questioned and tortured accused heretics right below rykard homeperhaps even as he entertained lords and ladies in the opulent manor aboveat some point during the shattering wars though it seems rykard attitude shifted instead of enforcing the laws of the golden order he turned against them discarding the faith and embracing all sorts of blasphemy and defilement given the nature of the inquisition he didn really have to go too far ideologically and he was able to bring a lot of the elements of the inquisitors into his new faithbut rykard embrace of blasphemy had its consequences too and his methods were too much for many of his soldiers the armies of the volcano manor largely abandoned their lord which might be the reason why rykard now employs contraptions marionettes grafted scions and other outcastswhile he doesn command the loyalty of soldiers and knights the way the other demigods do rykard does have several dedicated people who serve himand his idealsrykard decision to become a blasphemer isn just to feed his clear love of torture and depravity he embraces blasphemy because he come to hate the control of the greater will and the fingers he doesn believe the lands between should submit to their rule any longer and he looking for others to join him in sharing in that sentimentback in liurnia you might have met a woman named rya who asks your help in confronting another tarnished called the blackguard after he stole her necklace if you decide to assist you can either kill the blackguard whose actual name is big boggart or you can pay him off to get the necklace back either way bringing the necklace back to rya impresses her and she give you an invitation to volcano manor it turns out rya job is to seek out tarnished like youfolks who are willing to take on other tarnished and get their hands dirtyand recruit them to come back to the manor if you meet her again when you reach altus plateau she teleport you straight to the manor to meet its proprietress a woman named tanithyou can also make your way into volcano manor without an invitation and luckily this is seen as proof that you have the right kind of gumption to join the manor so either way tanith and her pals look to recruit youtanith is rykard consort a dancer he met in a foreign land seemingly during his stint with the inquisition he currently not around but tanith runs the show she entreats you to join up to fight against the influence of the golden order and the fingers and it not a bad pitch honestly what have the fingers done for you lately really except send you to your likely death against the most powerful people on the continent so you can fix their failing religion if you join volcano manor and its recusants you can take power from those who have it just like the gods do and make your own fateif you join the recusants tanith will offer you jobs to complete for volcano manor that prove your strength and give you opportunities to take from the weak those jobs are assassination contractsyou tasked with killing other tarnished complete enough of them and you eventually get a chance to meet rykard yourself you not the only one on this team either hanging around in the manor you can talk to a few other tarnished who joined up although they not all the diehard true believers in rykard ideology that tanith seems to beyou can also explore volcano manor now that you have access to it and speak more with rya pursue rya quest and you learn that there much more to volcano manor and the people who live there than you might first realizeexploring volcano manor goes handinhand with rya quest line which you can advance by finding her in one of the rooms of the manor after you completed an assassination contract or two what you discover in one of those side rooms is a halfhuman halfsnake hybrid the true form of rya as it turns out whose real name is zorayas she hides her serpentine form out of fear of rejection from others and explains that tanith is her mother zorayas doesn know much about her own history but tanith has told her that she was born by the grace of a glorious kingtalk to rya at other points and she mention hearing strange things behind the walls of volcano manor which can lead you to discovering illusory walls allowing you to discover secret hallways and chambers in the house as you search through them you discover more snake peoplethese ones hostileand a path outside the manor into the caldera of mt gelmir here you can discover prison town which provides a whole lot more information about what rykard and his followers are up to hereprison town has a few serpent people standing guard around it as well as abductor virgins cruising around and an omenkiller roaming its streets as you descend into its buildings you discover albinaurics in cages and all manner of torture implements toward the bottom you find albinaurics and a few human servants stretched out on tables mostly dead some dismembered the implication from the serpent people the albinaurics and what we eventually find out about the praetor himself is that rykard has been conducting experiments here likely to at least make more of these serpent people to aid him as he gathers strength to take on leyndell and the golden orderhere we see the reason for the abductor virgins to grab subjects for rykard work he seems to mostly have focused on albinaurics and we saw abductor virgins in raya lucaria that probably were there to scoop up more test subjects there are other interesting elements in and around prison town that suggest what rykard is up to you might eventually discover a magma wyrm hanging out in the magma caves beneath near prison town these wyrms aren descendants of dragons but are actually former humans who ate dragon hearts as a way to gain their strength eventually anyone who takes part in dragon communion and consumes the hearts to gain dragon powers loses their humanity including you in fact if you head to the church of dragon communion and eat the dragon hearts you get from killing dragon bossesalthough while you see some cosmetic effects you never turn into a magma wyrm yourself one such former person is conspicuously close to the place where rykard has a bunch of snake people running aroundinside prison town church you discover a godskin noble boss godskins are another deepdive element we won get into here but one notable thing about them is they wear the skins of other beings and they have traits of nonhuman creatures apostles can stretch themselves in the same way that rykard serpent men can and nobles have what look like dragon tails sticking out from beneath their skins we don know exactly why a godskin noble is hanging out at the volcano manor but his presence in the church suggests he rykard ally it all plays to a theme that suggests rykard is trying to combine different kinds of life together as part of his blasphemycontinuing rya quest you discover an item called the serpent amnion which gives clues about her birth she wasn born of the grace of a glorious king she realizes she was made through rykard hideous ritualsbut there no better piece of evidence pointing to rykard making blasphemous abominations than rykard himselfyou eventually come across rykard himself in a giant room filled with magma well actually first you find a giant snakethe goddevouring serpent the lore suggests this is eiglay the serpent of blasphemy whose temple you find not far from rykard complete with a huge snake skin hanging from its raftersfrom all the lore in this area we learn that when rykard chose blasphemy he really went allin he fed himself to the serpent and in that way joined with it becoming something other than humanearly in your time in volcano manor you might have interacted with the ghost of one of rykard soldiers who would have told you about a legendary spear called the serpenthunter it was once used to kill an eternal serpent apparently and the spear lore suggests that as rykard men watched him descent into depravity they looked for a way to stop him and discovered the spear the weapon has special properties against the goddevouring serprent allowing you to slay it fairly easily that forces rykard to reveal himselfin the second phase of the fight you realize that rykard and the snake really are one and the same with rykard face growing out of the snake neck and his arms erupting from its bodyhe even reaches down its throat and draws his sword the blasphemous blade fighting rykard here reveals the truth of what volcano manor and the recusant tarnished like godrick did with grafting rykard is looking for powerful tarnished that he can consume to strengthen himself any recusants who have proven their power by killing enough other tarnished are eventually sent to meet rykard who devours them and brings them into himself part of his familyfrom his dialogue and other lore entries you can gather that he sees this as the positive end result of the path of blasphemy as recusants get to become one with him everyone who rykard has eaten is still within him it seems making him a big blasphemous blob he actually flings ephemeral burning skulls at you which are the souls of the warriors he devouredof course rather than get eaten by a giant snake to become one with rykard you kill the lord of blasphemy or do you rykard doesn seem to think so based on his dialogue claiming that a serpent never dies and after all the demigod offered himself up to be eaten once so he couldn have been that worried about mortality for our purposes however he pretty dead and you can claim his great rune for your troublerykard death causes the breakup of the recusants and volcano manor with everyone going their separate ways no one particularly mad it seems although one of the recusants will invade you later under the right circumstances because of the lord of blasphemy own philosophy the strong take what they want and you were strong enough to take rykard great rune you might have killed the lord of blasphemy but you were still adhering to his blasphemous idealsreturn to rykard boss room later and you find tanith also adhering to blasphemous ideals she been eating the corpse of rykard and the goddevouring serpent and is pretty polite about the whole situation considering as she says when you visit her the hope is that rykard will become part of her the way he became part of the serpent that ate him the first time if it works then rykard might be back regardless it shows how incredibly disgustingly dedicated tanith is to her manhaving claimed another great rune you can proceed east across the altus plateau ahead waits leyndell home of the erdtree the elden ring and your chance to finally become elden lord,"What

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cat-cafe-manager-review-meow-were-in-business/1900-6417863/,few games are as informative in name as cat cafe manager just reading it you likely have a good idea as to whether or not it something you enjoy the combination of a cat adoption game and a restaurant sim is enough to make cozinessseeking gamers jump in without inspecting any further and while cat cafe manager is definitely a cozy experience it also has its faults and the handsoff direction of it all can lend itself to both fun and frustration at different timesthe setup is a familiar one you new to town and have been given a plot of land naturally you do what any sensible landowner would do begin to build a small business that combines two of humanity greatest idols brunch and cats immediately upon setting off to build the cafe of your dreams the bubbly music and adorable art direction provide the lax vibes you might expect from a game like thisbut just as soon cat cafe inundates you with messy textonly tutorials it a heap of information dumped at your lap which may be a rough opening for any player but especially the younger or lessexperienced crowd such a game may attract still once the busy ui has been deciphered the game economy is actually welldesigned demanding you cater your cafe to different clientele to serve different needsfor example if you need more building supplies to expand the square footage of your cafe you need to advertise to the town punks and ensure you serving their favorite dishes and drinks for maximum satisfaction if instead it ingredients and recipes you need you want to get witches to visit there are six customer types in all and each has their own currency as well as their own wants and needs in order to have a lovely time in your cafethis businessside consideration smartly extends into several aspects of the game you need more than just the right selection of items for the right customers you also need to adopt and train the right stray cats to cuddle up on customers laps befriend particular locals and hire and train the right staff to ensure they can cook well serve quickly and yes even clean up cat peein between business days you start new projectsskills reallysuch as gaining more staff or chair slots restock on food supplies and cat toys and further enhance your cafe with more stylish wallpaper prettier plants and snazzier tables and chairs eventually your oncemodest cafe will toss out the mismatched decor in favor of a consistent theme such as a bewitching bistro a hipster hangout or a straightup dive barcollectively all of these considerations pour into an overall cafe rating and each day you receive customer ratings from every single person who patronizes your store it a lovely ingame economy that guarantees there always something to do at least for the first dozen or so hoursit just too bad none of it really matters you see that cafe rating has little effect on anything your mismatched dining sets may bring down your overall rating and a witch who was denied her beloved pretzel may mean she didn have a great time but lemonade stand this is not nothing is of any real consequence in cat cafe managerduring my time with the game my almost threeyearold daughter became obsessed with it so in times when i wasn playing i let her mess around naturally this meant some menu items weren restocked and some customers left unhappy certainly even some of that aforementioned cat pee went unmopped i sorry to say but when i take the game back for myself i find i was nonetheless rich in its many currencies and resources because your hired staff behave autonomously the game essentially plays itself once you bring in some coworkers a few hours in sure the coffee machine may break down but customers always settle for a backup order even if it simply a glass of water in the most dire of casesin this way the game laissezfaire design is a bit too handsoff revealing this isn so much a proper restaurant simulation but rather set dressing for an admittedly adorable game about cats and coffee there no way to fail and no way even to really succeed at any notable level as the number of customers you serve in a day comes down solely to the number of chairs you can purchase and place in your cafeskill points are doled out liberally and the money in its many forms will keep flowing whether you have a hopping megastarbucks or a rundown assembly line of herbal teas and kitty pees all of this means your enjoyment of the game may come down to how much freedom you want i wanted more than what here but i can also squint and appreciate the antigame that cat cafe manager really ends up being younger players may need help getting past the game initial pamphlet of explainers but after that they can enjoy the game without fail states or a storyline to impede themone thing that will bug players of all sorts however is the faulty decorating mode tiles are placed square by square like in the sims when expanding your square footage the cursor gets lost behind already existing walls items such as artwork that may have been hanging on a wall oddly do not move with the wall leaving them in the middle of the floor this even strangely changes how to use the cursor as to reset decor after its attached wall has moved you must click the tile below the item rather than the item tile itself which is how it works in the rest of the game items clip through walls often too like rugs that will sit both indoors and outdoors this messiness gives the game a feeling of being in early access but it notit oddly restrictive with where some items can go too once i placed some outdoor stone tiles but when i wanted to move them i seemingly had no way of doing so when i unlocked a motorcycle decoration by befriending one of the regulars i wasn allowed to place it outside the cafe like i could with some of the flowersit not a bug but it also worth mentioning that the characters swear sometimes which seems so wildly out of place for a game like this there no voice acting so this will go over some players heads much like the tutorials but it just doesn fit and leaves a sour taste in my mouth given the outofcharacter nature this really feels like a game that would keep things kidfriendly at all times but curiously doesncat cafe manager is a perplexing game its design is deliberately forgiving but in some cases to a fault it looks and sounds joyful but bugs related to actually building the cafe of your dreams can be frustrating it still a game where fans of the genre can have fun with it provided they don mindor especially if they prefersomething so directionless but i find it hampers what could been a lovely blend of catsitting and

in just about any other game not only is this from the creator of dark soulsfrom softwarebut it also an openworld game that is very easy to get overwhelmed in if you don know what you doing that being said it also eliminates some of the hard roadblocks found in the studio other games as you can usually go do something else whenever you stuckas you first boot up elden ring you will be greeted with a myriad of choices and challenges and it may leave you wondering about your best way forward lucky for you we compiled a list of tips that can help you get off on the right foot in your adventure through the lands betweenyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing minutes of elden ring liurnia of the lakes gameplayfrom picking the right class to how and when to backtrack if you venture forth with this beginner guide you may just live to see the sunrise in elden ring here are some tips to help you on your journeythe first and most important decision youre going to make at the beginning of elden ring is choosing your starting class though you can certainly build your character into whatever you want them to be the starting classes provide you with upfront boosts to specific stats that benefit particular playstyles in addition youll start off with gear and potentially spells that match said playstylefor instance the vagabond is great for heavy weapon melee players while those seeking a ranged sorcerybased class would want to start with the astrologer of course you can check out our starting class guide for a deeper look at what makes each class tickafter resting at three sites of grace in the open world youll be visited by a mysterious woman named melina like maidens from previous from software games melina acts as a place to level up your character even more she provides you with a spectral seed whistle that allows you to summon your horse mount for faster travel around the lands betweenluckily finding your first three sites of grace wont be too overwhelming as the game offers you faint but noticeable rays of guiding light that point you in the direction of your next goals following these early on will ensure that you come across three sites of grace very quickly and unlock the ability to begin leveling your characterlike souls in dark souls runes act as a general progression currency in elden ring meaning they can be used to level up buy items or upgrade weapons and armor you can collect them from defeating enemies and bosses and theyre also obtainable through consumable items such as a fingerfolks rune or paupers runeas expected with a from software title however runes are dropped in the location of your death and you only get one shot to return to that site and recover them lest they be lost to you forever in other words if youre sitting on a large chunk of runes it might be best to go spend them at a site of grace before tackling a new boss or challenging areavery early on in your adventure you should come across a merchant who sells you an item that allows you to craft crafting is a vital component of elden ring and some of the consumable items you can create can make a world of difference in combat and exploration in order to craft those items however require you to gather materials throughout the lands betweencollecting these necessary crafting materials however might be easier than youd expect in some choice spots thats because you can actually just rest at a site of grace to respawn most nearby materials giving you an essentially endless supply of themprovided youre willing to invest this time in grindingas you exploring the overworld you likely notice that there are a lot of skulls with glowing eyes laying on the ground these are surprisingly valuable to you as destroying them will earn you an item that grants you a small number of runes considering how many you come across while navigating about you be surprised how lucrative they become you can destroy these skulls by running over them with your steed or you can just roll into them easy enoughone thing you can be guaranteed in elden ring is that you be dungeon diving into areas with little to no light with relative frequency because of this you want to grab a torch as soon as possible luckily that pretty much immediately after you emerge from the tutorial area into limgravefrom where you emerge and find your first overworld site of grace simply walk directly north to the church of elleh to find the merchant kal who will sell you a torch that can help you light your path through dark areas he sells other useful items too so make sure you collect some runes by killing some enemies nearby and peruse his waresthere are various common methods of using your enemies attacks against them in soulslike games such as parrying them at just the right time to earn a large window of opportunity for a critical hit but elden rings new guard counter ability may be the most useful addition to the formula in quite some timein order to guard counter simply block an enemys incoming attack and then tap the heavy attack button directly after by doing so youll dish out a significant retaliatory blow that can be very beneficial against foes with large health bars or higher defense even better this impressively strong attack can often break enemies stance and stuns them for a brief period of time giving you another chance to land critical hits and potentially finish them offkeep in mind however that you want to use guard counters at the end of enemy combos so as not to leave yourself open to their attacks too since heavy attacks take a little bit of time to complete just be sure youve got that opening before committingas you make your way through elden ring youre certain to discover and collect spirit ashes which will summon the spirits of foes to aid you in battle these spirit summons are great at keeping the attention off of you in battles and they can be leveled up later in the game to make them even more powerfulhowever it uses quite a lot of fp to call on spirits and there are only specific areas within which they can be summoned to clarify you need to be near a rebirth monument to call them in and if you leave that area theyll disappear additionally if they die in battle you wont be able to summon them back in during that encounterpay attention to the bottom left of your screen to see a monument icon that will light up when youre in an area wherein spirit ashes can be summoned and of course most bosses give you the option to summon them so make good use of them during those challenging showdowns to get a leg upthis is easily overlooked but extremely important stealth is considerably more useful at night than during the day while you can no doubt make good use of stealth behind and around the sides of enemies during the day youll find that nighttime serves up an excellent boon to this sneaky optionduring the day stealthing in front of an enemy will cause them to see you from quite a distance away but that very same enemy wont see you until youre a good bit closer when the sun has set this means that you can get away with walking closer to a frontfacing enemy under the cover of night making this the absolute best option for making your way through massive packs of enemies you may not be prepared to tackle quite yettraversing the open world on horseback is definitely the quickest and most efficient manner to get to new places in the lands between there are even some meaningful benefits to staying on your horse for some encounters such as quicker inandout movement and the ability to escape quickly if needed but its important to note that staying in the saddle after a few solid hits may be a bad callafter taking a certain amount of damage youll be thrown from your horse and stunned on the ground for what feels like an eternity during this time you wont be able to move but enemies will be able to continue wailing on you relentlessly in other words once this happens you can expect a high chance of death as you can be certain that enemies arent going to hold backso when youve taken a few hits while engaged with an enemy or group of enemies while on horseback go ahead and perform a leap attack off of your steed and fight your foes on foot its safer to lose some movement potential than it is to chance being beaten mercilessly on the ground with no means of retaliationelden ring is a truly gigantic game and as such it breaks from tradition by granting players a gorgeouslyillustrated map of course this remains a from software game so simply having a map isnt going to make things significantly easier on you youll need to know how to use it to its ultimate potential in order to save yourself a lot of time lateryoull have to put much of the work in yourself by actively using your own markers to denote areas of importance on elden rings map thankfully there are a wide variety of different markers available that you can place at points of interest helping you to remember where to find an item a wellhidden entrance or a pack of dangerous enemies youre just not ready to take on yet use these frequently and youll be able to spend more time exploring new areas and less time trying to remember where things were laterspeaking of riding your horse you be happy to know there are multiple ways to take care of your trusty steed torrent has his own health bar separate from yours so you want to keep him topped off by feeding him raisins which can be crafted using a variety of rowa fruits that you collect along your journeymeanwhile all hope isn lost if torrent dies either he be automatically revived any time you use a site of grace or if you in desperate need of his mobility before reaching a place to rest you can revive him by using one charge of your flask of crimson tearsas mentioned in the last point using your horse to escape encounters is a nice option to have in a game as immensely challenging as elden ring youll want to ensure that youre always considering your best approach especially against the games most deadly enemiesmany areas of the open world will have roaming packs of enemies that may create an oppressive situation for you if youre caught surrounded and underprepared since you may have a large collection of runes that you dont want to lose its often better to escape on horseback and reset the encounter so that you can scout and reassess how best to tackle the scenario with a new approach in some cases it might be best to just escape altogether and return when youre stronger or have less at stake better safe than sorrylook from softwares roleplaying romps are some of gamings most challenging titles but part of the fun is that satisfying sense of reward that comes from overcoming adversity its important to remember that we all have to start somewhere though and that not everyone approaches these games with the same level of skill or knowledge with that said if youre feeling a little overwhelmed it might be worth considering a magic buildat least until you get your bearingshaving the option to keep your enemies at a distance while blasting them with sorceries or incantations can help you overcome areas with which you may have otherwise struggled you can still dabble in closeup combat and ease your way into that style if thats something you still want to eventually mastereven if youre a veteran of the genre though intelligence and faith builds still offer their own challenges due to delicate resource management and the need to make clever use of spacing so dont worry that magic completely trivializes the game you can still expect to be tested and broken plenty but having a little bit of space to breathe can be helpfulfor more on elden ring check out our elden ring reviewelden ring

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/bugsnax-the-isle-of-bigsnax-review-secret-menu/1900-6417869/,i find it interesting how much the isle of bigsnax mimics the entirety of bugsnax itself on the surface it just another area of snaktooth island the game original setting to exploreeven if this one is technically not on snaktooth itself when i finished exploring and completed all of the new missions my initial thought was that it however much like snaktooth itself there is more than meets the eye in this update what seems like fast food quickly becomes a multicourse return trip to the world of bugsnax including a brief taste of future additions to the menu the longer you eat the better this meal gets but you will need to have patience in order to get to the good partsthe isle of bigsnax itself is called broken tooth though calling it the isle of big snax is a perfect descriptor the inhabitants of broken tooth are all massive bugsnax grown to mammoth proportions and you again trying to capture them all although they impossible to trap through the normal means employed in the base game two of the unique bugsnax to this islandthe bunger royale and the deviled egglerare retreads of previous the rest are brand new to the bugsnax ranks there spaghider a spaghetti spider with a meatball for an abdomen cheddorb a rolling cheese ball with googly eyes and millimochi a slithering set of mochi balls that follows you around as you try to complete tasks among othersto capture these new creatures you have to resort to other means shrink spice canisters of this spice are scattered throughout the island and picking one up starts a countdown at the end of that countdown the canister explodes and any bugsnak in its vicinity shrinks allowing players to use normal traps to catch it i like the idea of an added obstacle and i like the idea of shrink spice it only found in specific places around broken tooth and you can only carry one jar at a time this isn something like say the sauces in the sauce slinger where you can carry at a time and reload whenever you see a plant shrink spice is more precious more finite and therefore more important limiting the resource like this was a good idea as it makes the resource seem crucial to success and finding it near a big bugsnak you haven caught before is much more impactful if you were able to throw it around on demand like ketchup or the other sauces that are used in the base game this new biome would have been much too easyhowever even with the shrink spice mechanic i finished broken tooth in around two hours which feels a bit short ultimately it just another set of foodbased bugs to catch in a new area with the goal of completing tasks and advancing a story a story that begins and ends in broken tooththe story being told around these immense insects while exhibiting the same lack of fear over tackling heavy material that the core game showed doesn leave the same impression as the core game narrative there are some serious matters addressedscience vs religion via floofty and shelda separation anxiety through chandlo etcbut they feel underdeveloped and lack enough time to fully blossom i wanted to hear more of shelda and floofty debates for example and i wished this exploration had carried over to the main game when i went back to snaktooth island i enjoyed the story of bugsnax one about a group of characters that begins broken but slowly works through their differences through discussion rather than destruction eventually forming a bond that ultimately saves their lives the brief tale told on broken tooth fits right into the arc the aforementioned science vs religion debate being a great example but i was left wanting more thankfully a wealth of new mechanics and features helps keep the dlc from feeling entirely underwhelmingthe biggest and most important addition in this update is without question fast travel the amount of time saved by not having to run from sizzling sands all the way to flavor falls or frosted peak is invaluable and it improves the game pace immensely as a result i reached the ending of the game in this playthrough in about twothirds of the time it took me in my original run and while the game dragged at times then i did not feel that way this timethe second major additionthough this one is admittedly less impactful than fast travelis getting your own hut in snaxburg at long last the grumpuses have decided you don have to go without basic shelter and have built you a place to live right in town that you can decorate however you please with decor earned throughout the game while it not the most involved house builder in the worldyou basically just placing objects in designated areas when you enter build modeit enough to give players their own little slice of home among the other grumpuses in snaktoothin order to earn decorations for your new home you have to engage in the third major new element in bugsnax a mail system a mailbox has appeared in front of your hut and fellow campers will add letters containing missions for you to review some of the tasks are simplefeed x bugsnak to y grumpusbut others range from menial to downright fiendish there one letter from snorpy that asks you to catch five snakpods in seconds a task that took some real planning here a hint do it in scorched gorge fetching items can be a chore too especially the one triffany left on the very top of the mountain in frosted peak how she got up there with barbecue ribs for arms i never know but that the beauty of bugsnaxthese new tasks do a fantastic job of not only extending the life of the adventure but also giving us more of the other grumpuses vibrant personalities that made them so endearing in the core game gramble is sending letters with greetings from his pets cromdo gives you decorations and then tries to charge you for them and the list goes on each author personality shines in each letter even those you might not expect to hear from my favorite part of the original game was spending time with each grumpus and this new mail system gives that opportunity in a smart and mostly fun wayfinally it should be mentioned that some wild bugsnax can be found wearing hats of which can be collected and worn by any bugsnak donated to gramble barn in snaxburg other than giving you something else to find in your travels around snaktooth they don really add much to the overall adventure the snax sure look cute wearing them thoughmy favorite part of the isle of bugsnax however is a new piece of lore that tucked away among the big bugsnax there will be some detective work involved as finding it will have you looking for clues in broken tooth snaktooth itself and even the mail system getting there was challenging but once i had put the pieces together they delivered an a ha moment that was immensely satisfying and led to a fascinating discovery if you one of those players who gets sucked into a world through its lore this is an incredible payoffbut that all i say about iton the surface the isle of bigsnax feels like just another bugsnax biome arrive catch new complete missions and watch the story unfold and then head back to snaxburg that not bad per seit more bugsnax after allbut it also not a reinvention however the qualityoflife improvementslike fast travel and the mailing

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-caelid-guide-important-locations-bosses-dangers-and-secrets/1100-6501710/,one of elden ring most dangerous regions is caelid located east of the starting limgrave area it tough to get there at a low level because you supposed to come here near the middle of your adventure and if you arrive by mistake buckle up scarlet rot plague and terrifying enemies await as well as one of elden ring hardest bossescaelid is an optional zone meaning that you dont need to explore it or defeat starscourge radahn at redmane castle if you dont want to though you do need to beat at least two shardbearers to progress to the end of elden ring and you must defeat radahn before you get the mimic tear its best to fully explore caelid after completing the academy of raya lucaria and defeating rennalacaelid is located directly east of limgrave but its reasonably cordoned off from the main path if youve been steadily heading north through the stormveil castle region toward godrick the grafted even though its nearby where you began elden ring dont feel like you absolutely need to clear your way through caelid before youre readythere are a handful of ways to arrive in caelid but there are three main pathways into caelid that youll find useful if youre determined to uncover caelids secretslocated immediately east of the first step grace point sunken into the agheel lake is a set of ruins called the dragonburnt ruins fight through the swarm of undead grunts then descend into the first staircase you find out in the open underneath these ruins is a teleporter trappedchest which sends you to a cavern in caelid the sellia crystal tunnel which is full of diggers and prawn minersdont worry if you cant fight these enemies yet simply turn right from the shack you spawn into head down the ramp and through the cave until you come to a ladder jump down and youll be at a site of grace and the entrance to the sellia crystal tunnel which leads out into the aeonia swamp in the heart of caelidcross through the saintsbridgesummonwater village areas of limgrave and then keep heading northeast ascending upward until you come across an area called the smoldering church youll get invaded by an npc at this point but if you can beat them youll get the ability to travel further east toward rotview balcony which is where you get your first real taste of the desolation that underscores the caelid experience as some online have put it another way to reach the smoldering church is by visiting the third church of marika then by riding the wind currents up the cliffs while riding torrentbehind the third church of marika in limgrave is a small creek if you search through the foliage nearby youll uncover a teleporter nestled into the base of the cliff activating the teleporter sends you all the way to the bestial sanctum which is a valuable hunting ground to get a lot of runes very quickly with little chance of losing them all and having to start over grab the nearby grace point from here you can head south down the road if youre comfortable passing one or two bosses that can oneshot you plus a few dragons and descend into caelid from the dragonbarrow subregion that you teleported intocaelid is brimming with secrets we wont spoil them all in fact we very likely havent found all of them yet ourselves that said its good to note which major areas to make a point of visiting while youre on your quest to dethrone radahn and get as much loot as you can while doing it because why notfort gael and rotview balcony share the western side of caelid thats characterized by lots of lordsworn soldiers and giant rotting animals contesting for dominance over the blighted land as you head south youll witness more and more of the carnage fort gael is more or less insulated from this surrounded by elite guard troops and sitting on a cliffside upon which it solemnly faces west toward limgrave if you manage to enter fort gael you can fight a lion guardian which drops the ash of war lions claw but be wary since this fight takes place in an enclosure that the lion guardian likes to thrash around in and it can be difficult to kill early onaeonia swamp sits in the center of caelid and it features the highest concentration of scarlet rot that you will come across points of interest are sparse and you certainly dont want to rest in one spot too longscarlet rot can slowly build up and if it reaches a certain threshold itll begin draining your health the street of sages ruins on the west side of the aeonia swamp area houses the powerful meteorite staff that can be highly useful to astrologer builds the east side of aeonia features a boss battle with commander oneil who is incredibly difficult to beat alone at low levels but is necessary to defeat in order to progress the millicent questlinesellia houses several interesting treasures such as the nox flowing sword and lusats glintstone staff both of which can be unlocked by lighting the three signal fires throughout town located in three different towers which can be accessed via the towns rooftops and defeating the nox swordstress and nox priest located in the chaircrypt of sellia once the seal to the sellia backstreets is unlocked you can travel uphill to the church of the plague where you can find millicent and begin her questlinegreyolls dragonbarrow comprises the northern half of caelid and is named for its wide array of dead and undead dragons presumably its also named for the elder dragon greyoll which guards the region south of the farum greatbridge that links the caelid mainland and the northern bestial sanctum together the farum greatbridge is unironically also guarded by a separate dragon named greyll there are two minor erdtrees in this region as well as a plethora of caves and minor dungeons the best place to farm runes early on in elden ring is by stalking the plains outside of farum greatbridge south of bestial sanctum and hunting the vulgar militia that wander around and drop runes per killredmane castle is similar to stormveil castle in limgrave it is the toughest part of the zone to break into and it hosts caelids big fight with the zone boss radahn unlike stormveil there is only one way to get inside once youve reached the front gates beyond redmane castle is a coastal area that hosts a few additional areasthe caelid map is located on a fork in the road between the southern aeonia swamp bank point of grace to the northeast and the cathedral of dragon communion to the southwest the location where youll find the map is also characterized by a nearby nomadic merchant who sells nomadic warriors cookbook among a few other thingsyoull also want to nab the dragonbarrow map which is located east of the minor erdtree closest to the smoldering church and southwest of the divine tower of caelid its also in a fork in the road and you can find the other caelid merchant in the isolated merchants shack to the northwest of where you found the dragonbarrow mapon the road between sellia town of sorcery to the north and sellia gateway to the south is gowrys shack speaking to gowry inside he tells you hed like to cure a young girl who has become stricken with scarlet rot the only problem is that he needs an unalloyed gold needle to do sofinding one is simple obtaining it for yourself is not in order to get one you need to defeat commander oneil who is located immediately west of gowrys shack behind a thick canopy of sickened trees hes a particularly tough boss who summons exile soldiers and uses sweeping windbased attacks with his halberd so its recommended you either invite cooperators or rely heavily on torrent for the fightonce finished return to gowry who tells you to wait for a bit return to any point of grace then back to gowrys shake where he gives you a note explaining that you need to light the fires in sellia to unlock its secret simply doublejump over the rooftops in town using torrent each tower is pretty easy to see at any point in town you simply need to clear a path to each one without falling down onto the streets belowonce all three are lit you can enter the sellia backstreets and head up to the church of the plague where millicent is offer the item gowry gave you and rest at the nearby grace point once rested speak to her again to finish the questfinishing millicents quest in caelid rewards the prosthesiswearer heirloom a talisman that raises dexterity by five points if you complete her quest and save her from the scarlet rot she appears later on in a much longer questline that culminates with you being able to earn millicent prosthesis a talisman that rewards five points of dexterity and increases the attack power of your consecutive attacksat the southern tip of caelid is a point of grace called impassable greatbridge its possible to travel across this bridge but it did get its name for a good reason youll need to dodge an onslaught of ballista bolts that can easily knock you off of torrenteven when dashing at full speedand pin you to the ground if they dont immediately kill youthat said if you can make it past all of redmane castles frontal defenses youll find that the front gate is closed indefinitely good news though there is a side passage that you can follow by jumping across the siege tower and onto the crag leading around the castle to the right youll run into some potentially tough fights with giant bats along the way but youll eventually find a ladder that you can climb up once inside the castle rush to the ground floor then move north and east until you find the grace point called chamber outside the plaza thisll be your foothold for exploring the rest of redmane castle on your own time and this is also where youll launch your assault on starscourge radahn fromif crossing the impassable greatbridge isnt your style then theres a stealthier way to get to the redmane front gates travel to fort gael south of the rotview balcony and sneak inside by climbing onto the tree branch that winds around the corner to the right past the closed front door climb up the ladder then either fight or ignore the foes on the rampart including the knight dont fall into the pit or engage the lion guardian if you dont want to your goal is to climb to the top of the tower and open the treasure chest at the top which is a trapped teleporter chest that ports you directly to the redmane castle front gatescaelid is where you can find one of the most powerful katanas in elden ring moonveil which deals magic damage and scales with strength dexterity and intelligence if thats your style then you can easily find it by slaying the magma wyrm inside of the gael tunnel dungeonyou can travel south from rotview balcony to get to the main gael tunnel entrance if you like to grab that point of grace but there a much easier and simple path directly to the boss fight from limgrave you can sneak into gael tunnel by going to the third church of marika and climbing up the cliffs to the northeast until you find the rear gael tunnel entrance point of grace which conveniently places you right next to the entrance to the magma wyrms lairthe magma wyrm is pretty slow and predictable only using the same few moves in a row its also weak to piercing attacks the main attack to watch out for is its magma breath attack where it slowly fills certain areas of the chamber with magma as it plows through the rest of the magma wyrms attacks are large area of effect sweeps with its claws and tail which can be telegraphed and dodgerolled through it also has an attack where it slashes the ground for a moment then pulls its claw back in a sort of fake out move that can catch you unaware if you reacted too quickly to ie dodgerolled in closer to strike after the initial groundslashother than that the magma wyrm fight is pretty straightforward dont feel shy about inviting friends to help you beat it once finished youre rewarded with the moonveil and a fresh new dragon hearttheres plenty else to see and do in caelid but dont let us spoil all the fun of uncovering the rest of its myriad secrets for

playing but it always ends in laughter and hijinks as friends plot each others demise and sometimes unknowingly send themselves off the boardthe resistance is a great game for larger groups anywhere from five to players in this game there are two sides the resistance an underground group of fighters fighting against an oppressive leadership and the government spies who have infiltrated their group the goal of the resistance is to successfully complete a certain number of missions while the spies will win if they ensure a certain number of missions fail the catch is that while the spies know each others identities the resistance only knows the number of spies among their group meaning those players must choose carefully when deciding who goes on each mission the resistance is similar to mafia or werewolf in that players must debate and figure out the identities of the spies based on people actions and behaviors from bluffing your way through as a resistance member to throwing false accusations at other players there are plenty of things you can do as a spy to throw other players off track and it incredibly funthe red dragon inn the character trove is a fastpaced card game

using a combination of our own wordleobsessed staff and a bit of computing we come up with this list of the best wordle starting words so you can improve your score each day use this list to best your friends and family and chase those coveted twoor threeguess solutions making you look like a genius to your family and friends here are our picks for the best starting words for wordle as well as some top tips from our most enthusiastic playersif you prefer a list of the best first words for wordle we recommend starting any given day with these if you rather hear directly from some of our wordleobsessed editors be sure to check out their more specific strategies below the key is often to quickly find vowels or common consonants that belong in each day word from that starting point we identified these words as some of the very best first words for wordlemy goto strategy with wordle is twopronged concentrate on the vowels and then narrow it down with the most common consonants i start with a vowelheavy word like adieu which usually identifies at least one letter two if i lucky based on that first try i then try and find a word that incorporates consonants like t s and r on the second line and if i feeling particularly smart i try and fit in the vowel o somewhere as well this strategy usually leads me to a solution by line of my wins in the last two weeks have been at although it has led me astray once damn you tiger randy ramsayive loved word games for just about as long as ive been able to string words together so a lot of what i pull from when i strategize in wordle is the undisputed classic among them scrabble scrabble assigns point values to letters based on how commonly they appear in the english language with the lowestscoring letters being the most popular if like me youve invested far too much time into that game try to think of which letters have the lowest value and make sure you can squeeze em in your first guess i tend to find atone and irate are good first triesyou manage to check the puzzle for three vowels and a couple of commonly used letters in locations they typically appear in another tip think in pairs as you continue if you know an h is the second letter try getting both an s and a c in your next guess since they commonly go in front of h jessica howardwhen i first started playing wordle i was all over the place i would repeatedly try letters i knew weren there and it took me a solid week to remember that letters could be repeated seriously wordle needs some kind of indicator for repeated letters as a seasoned player going on three weeks now i finally got my strategy i start with arise a solid word that knocks out three vowels and two common consonants i aim to get vowels placed as quickly as possible because for some reason my brain can work around those foundations easier than consonants i don understand why either but since i implemented that strategy i typically guess the word in three or four goes and havent missed a single one lucy jamesmy advice is at odds with what you probably expect don stress too much about it i eager to guess the day word in as few tries as possible but i mindful of not turning wordle into a chore by trying to minmax my way to that goal while i do try to think of words with vowels and more common letters i stay away from x z and q i try a different word every day and just go with the flow i initially lamented that wordle doesn let you go back and replay old puzzles but i quickly grown fond of its oneperdayandthatit structure overaggressive tweeting from fellow players aside it remained a relaxing treat by not taking it too seriously or worrying about using the perfect word right from the getgo chris pereiramy approach to wordle and many of life big challenges started by looking to a group of people that i have often sought guidance and advice from and believe to be enlightened thinkers that are unmatched by any other scholars as expected they gave me exactly what i was looking for a versatile starting word that thus far has yielded excellent results of course i am talking about the legendary staten islandbased hiphop group wutang clan and naturally the word i always begin with is cream as we all know track eight on enter the wutang chambers posits that cash rules everything around me cream get the money dollar dollar bill y time has proven this adage correct but within the context of wordle cream also gets the solution dollar dollar bills y tamoor hussainif all else fails and you think your current strategy just doesn work no matter what you could always go the route of this devoted playeri do farts because if the word is ever farts and i get it on the first try it will be the best day of my lifegood luck with your next

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-beat-starscourge-radahn-in-elden-ring/1100-6501545/,the elden ring radahn boss battle is among the games most difficult fights it technically optional but skipping it will mean you can go to one of the most important areas in the whole game so you going to want to take this starscourge downmultiple instantkill attacks swift unpredictable sword combos and a nighunbeatable second phase make the radahn fight one youre better off seeking help for from software added this help in the form of multiple npcs that can create an opening for you to attack and bring radahn to his knees when its too dangerous for you to try here how to beat radahn in elden ringyou can fight radahn at any point in the game without even having to deal with a dungeon hes sent summons across the land calling for champions to fight him in the hopes of ending his scarlet rotinduced madness dont let the ease of access fool you though you should be at least level before fighting radahn ideally with a powerful weapon suited to your chosen build such as the moonveil katana or strong spells with good range including comet activate your great runegodricks is recommended as ever with elden rings boss fightsand make sure your flask of wondrous physik has a handy combination of buffs readyonce youre ready head to redmane castle in southeastern caelid south of sellia town of sorcery and east of the cathedral of dragon communion use the teleporter near the site of grace at the bridge to avoid dealing with the slog through the castle and then head inside speak with jerren the old man on the platform when youre ready to battle then take the elevator down to the beachunlike most fights you can summon several npc companions once the battle against radahn begins also unlike most fights radahn can oneshot you with his homing gravity arrows keep your target lock on radahn so you can see the arrows then dodge once they get near the debris doesnt always stop the arrows from hitting you so dont count on them as foolproof covermake your way to the golden summoning signs as you go along activating each when you get to it you can summon blaidd alexander the pot warrior okina and at least three more none of them last long but theyre a good distraction to make approaching radahn easieras you get closer radahn shoots a series of spears at you these rain down in a straight line and follow you so continue dodging them until the rain stops if this attack is giving you trouble you can continue dodging the gravity arrows until one of the npc summons reaches radahnonce you or an ally gets closer radahn starts charging around on his impossibly tiny beleaguered horse and slashing at everything in his way abandoning his ranged attacks hell engage in one of several potential attacks often with little warning the most common seems to be a general slashing combo where radahn will use between one and four wild slashes and possibly end with a slamthe main thing about radahn and his other attacks is that theyll take time to learn perhaps in keeping with his rotaddled frame of mind radahns timing is unpredictable at first aside from his dive attacks which he telegraphs by bringing his swords in front of him almost all of his attacks have odd delayed timing his swing combo features multiple delays for example he hold the first swing for roughly three seconds then slams his fist down immediately afterward followed by a few more slashes with a secondlong delay between eachanother attack to watch for in this phase is his gravity smash radahn plunges his swords into the ground and surrounds them with a purple gravity field he then pulls them out with huge pieces of stone attached slams them down and creates a massive gravity shockwave the shockwave is potentially an instant kill attackradahn moves fast but there are some key openings for melee builds to exploit as with most large bosses radahn is vulnerable for a brief time at the end of a combo or major attackenough for two maybe three hits before you need to retreat some players recommend using the icerind hatchets frostbite skill or hoarfrost stomp to inflict damage and build radahns frostbite meter though it does require good timingand time you could spend rushing in to attack before retreatingradahn is vulnerable to frostbite and other status conditions but especially scarlet rot rot pots and arrows tinged with scarlet rot are good options if you want to take advantage of status effects for this fight these weaknesses remain even in phase two magic wielders should focus on spells with short casting times or with more defensive properties such as glintblade phalanxfinally note that you can resummon vanquished npcs a short time after they die its a handy way to distract radahn and give yourself a break and its vital for the second phaseafter radahns health drops below hell fly into the sky and eventually crash back down in a ball of flameand with some deadly new attacks along with the usual radahn now has a gravity pull move that draws you in a gravity wave attack that unleashes a massive energy wave and a spinning attack where radahn leaps into the air spins towards you then backs up and does it againon top of all that radahn also has a gravity version of glintblade phalanx where he summons four massive rocks that hover around him and strike at random theres no predicting these but if they hit you its back to phase one againthe best way to deal with this is just not dealing with it let the npcs do it for you or youll just end up dying repeatedly when radahn flies into the air gallop away on torrent and resummon the dead npcs some players have had good luck hiding behind sand dunes to avoid the giant rocks though its possible they wont target you anyway if youre far enough away eventually the npcs will wear radahn down and you can move on with your adventureelden ring

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-stats-explained-understanding-the-basics-of-leveling/1100-6500671/,elden ring is considerably more newcomerfriendly than previous from software games but building a powerful character still isn as simple in other actionrpgs leveling up requires some expertise in its own right and we explain how you can level up your character and which stats are important to make the powerful hero you hoping forfor more on the game check out our elden ring review in progress you can also look up our guide hub for additional help on everything from finding certain items to picking a classin order to level up you first need to reach your third site of grace in the open world which happens quite early on in your adventure this is very easy to do thanks to the rays of guiding light that you can follow from one of these points of respite to the next when youve rested at that third site of grace youre greeted by a maiden named melina she offers her services to you which now allows you to level up at any site of grace in the gameunlike many traditional roleplaying titles elden ring requires you to manually apply every level to your character which can be done at any site of grace throughout your adventure killing enemies nets you runes the equivalent of souls from dark souls that you then use to invest in a selection of stats that increase things like your health pool stamina bar size and damage with specific weapons or spells upgrading one stat increases your character by one level with the remaining stats staying unchangeddo be aware however that dying in elden ring causes you to lose any runes youve accumulated but not yet used youll be granted one opportunity to return to the site where you died to recover the runes but if you fail theyll be lost forever because of this its typically a good idea to find a site of grace and use your runes to level up before taking on bosses or dangerous new areaseach point you put in vigor increases your total hp which in turn increases your survivability against enemy attacks fall damage and environmental hazardsmind boosts your maximum fp which grants you more sorcery and incantation casts this is also a useful stat to level if you intend to regularly use your melee weapons special abilitiesleveling up endurance increases your overall stamina which allows you to attack defend and dodge more frequently it also increases equip load allowing you to wear heavier armor and wield heavier weaponsputting points into strength allows you to wield heavier weapons while also increasing the damage done by any weapons that scale with the statdexterity is a versatile stat that provides an increase to the damage of weapons that scale with the stat reduces the cast time of your spells makes it harder to be knocked off your horse and decreases fall damageintelligence is necessary for improving the damage of sorcery spells and intelligencescaling weapons and it must be increased to learn more powerful sorceries toofaithscaling weapons and incantations require points being placed in faith as does learning the most powerful incantationsleveling up arcane brings increases to your discovery which means that youll have better luck finding items from the enemies you defeat certain sorceries and incantations also benefit from this statyour level increases with each point you place into one of the games eight primary stats depending on what starting class you chose at the beginning of the game or what longterm build youre hoping to accomplish your stat spread will differ melee users and magic users will have entirely different priorities for instance as well as main and secondary stats to account for while working towards an optimal buildmeleefocused characters will typically want to focus on vigor endurance and either strength or dexterity to ensure theyve got enough health stamina and damage output you can also opt to equally level strength and dexterity to create what is known as a quality build this build allows you to be fairly proficient in melee weapons that scale with either or both of the stats though doing so will admittedly limit you from ever being perfectly optimized for either even so it widely considered the best option for players looking to wield a variety of weapon types in from software games and the ash of war system will let you change the scaling on your weapons to better benefit from itmeanwhile sorceryfocused characters will be best served by investing in mind and intelligence for huge bursts of magical damage and a large fp elden rings mana pool and incantationfocused characters will want to go big on mind and faith so that they can deal solid damage and pull off huge heals also making use of that larger fp barits worth noting however that even magicbased builds benefit from limited investment in vigor to provide a larger health bar some magic weapons have strength or dexterity requirements too meaning you may need to meet a certain requirement in those stats to wield them as long as you simply aim to meet those base requirements and dont dump additional unnecessary points into strength or dexterity though you should always be able to maintain your general focus on sorcery or incantation useof course youre free to experiment with hybrid builds that incorporate various playstyles just be aware that doing so puts you at a disadvantage in some scenarios and will almost certainly keep you from ever reaching the full potential in any one category unless you intend to

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-weapons-in-elden-ring/1100-6502513/,weapons in elden ring are a crucial part of nearly every character build whether you focused on dealing massive damage with powerful strikes or you prefer dualwielding quick blades they the focal point for any player trying to make their way through the lands between with as few deaths as possible but they aren all equal while the weapons players can use will depend on the points they put into each attribute they can always respec their points after defeating rennala queen of the full moonwhether players want a weapon for the long haul or simply want to try out different methods of combat we compiled a list of the top weapons in elden ring this list is categorized by weapon type with each category containing one or two weapons not every weapon category available in the game will be present thoughyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing elden ring accolades trailerwe also taken the point in elden ring when players can unlock these weapons into consideration as an example the sacred relic sword is a fantastic weapon but players can only unlock it after defeating the final boss players who don want to take on journey in new game plus won be able to make use of that weapon in elden ring the weapons on this list will be usable at some point before the final boss fightwhile this weapon was nerfed by the developers at from software it still possesses great power for strengthdexterity or intelligencearcane builds the reason why the sword of night and flame is so powerful is because of its preequipped ash of war nightandflame stance this ash can decimate enemies around the player in one fell swoop players are also receiving the benefit of dealing three types of damage with the straight sword in physical magic and fire the sword of night and flame power isn what it once was at the beginning of the game but it still worth it for players to try outplayers can find this straight sword in carian manor by going to the manor upper level site of grace and dropping down to a room on the ground floorthere are a couple of different katanas that should garner the attention of players while samurai players can wield the uchigatana for a solid portion of the game even those characters should swap it out for one of two choicesthis is the katana that swept through the community during the early stages of elden ring release players immediately discovered that the moonveil katana was arguably the most powerful bloodloss weapon in the game along with having the bloodloss passive effect the moonveil also features the devastating transient moonlight ash of war this ash shoots out a stream of light after players have completed a light or strong attack this light can then stagger enemies and break their poise with one hit the moonveil katana also deals both physical and magic damage making it a dualthreat for multiple buildsplayers can loot the moonveil by defeating the magma wyrm in caelid at gael tunnelwhile some players will stand by the hand of malenia as the next best katana we opted for the rivers of blood for a couple of reasons for starters the rivers of blood doesn have the high dexterity requirement that the hand of malenia has instead players only need strength dexterity and arcane moreover the rivers of blood has arguably the better overall scaling and preequipped ash of war in corpse piler this ash inflicts massive blood loss onto enemies and deals a solid amount of damage in the processplayers need to defeat bloody finger okina at the church of repose in the mountaintops of the giants to unlock the rivers of bloodwhile there is one clearcut best greatsword in elden ring we be including two in case players builds don match the necessary requirements for the bestinclass weaponanother famous elden ring weapon the dark moon greatsword is arguably the best intelligence weapon in the lands between players might think a staff would hold that title but the dark moon greatsword can deal a massive amount of magic damage this is mostly thanks to the intelligence scaling featured on the sword the dark moon greatsword features one of the best ashes of war moonlight greatsword which buffs magic attack power and coats the sword in frost to deal damage once players hit an enemy with a charged attack this particular greatsword requires intelligence to use though so some players might need to respec in order to use itplayers can loot the dark moon greatsword after completing ranni questlinethe blasphemous blade is nowhere near as powerful as the dark moon greatsword but also doesn feature the stat requirements of that weapon players only need strength dexterity and faith to wield this blade this greatsword deals additional fire damage while also healing the player of max hp plus an additional hp upon every enemy death the blade ash of war taker flames increases this healing buff in addition to dealing fire damageplayers can unlock the blasphemous blade through finger reader enia after defeating rykard lord of blasphemy and claiming his remembrancethere are a few curved greatswords that players can use to great effect in elden ring but we going with one in particular that can carry players through the entire gamebloodhound fang is arguably the best earlygame weapon in all of elden ring players can loot it within a few hours of playing assuming they skilled enough and it has the ability to be the weapon players are holding when they defeat the final boss it scales marvelously with strength and dexterity and also doesn feature any ridiculous stat requirements if players scale correctly they can exceed damage with each hit from the fang not to mention the sword ash of war bloodhound finesse lets players strike twice while moving swiftly around an enemy the bloodhound fang is the choice for the best curved greatsword due to its low requirements unlock point and overall scalingplayers can unlock the bloodhound fang by defeating bloodhound knight darriwil at the forlorn hound evergaol in limgravethere are two choices for the best colossal sword in elden ring and players can really go wrong with either of themthe grafted blade greatsword is a hugely powerful strengthbuild weapon that comes with a high stat requirement of however if players manage to get there they will have the ability to demolish enemies in one to two hits this colossal sword has high physical damage that scales great with strength and a devastating ash of war oath of vengeance this ash boosts all of the player attributes for seconds in addition to increasing poise for tough boss battles there arguably not a better weapon to use if players have points in strengthplayers can loot the grafted blade greatsword after defeating leonine misbegotten at castle morne in weeping peninsulain elden ring players can acquire two colossal swords by defeating the demigods starscourge radahn and maliketh the black blade while maliketh blade is certainly worth a spot on this list we going with the starscourge greatsword due to its earlier unlock point in elden ring the stats on the weapons aren different enough to warrant players waiting until they defeat malikeththe starscourge greatsword deals a solid amount of physical damage while also adding in magic damage it can also be dualwielded which gives players an additional moveset and more damage with each swing the ash of war starcaller cry is fantastic at clearing out enemies players can use starcaller cry once to suck enemies in and then again to pound both swords into the ground and send out a gravity explosionwe feel there one colossal weapon in elden ring that outmatches its counterparts which is viewable below however an honorable mention will go to the ghiza wheel for its incredible ash of war which lets players use it like a lawnmower to tear up enemiesthe fallingstar beast jaw is the only colossal weapon in elden ring to feature more than just physical damage this sword also deals magic damage but doesn require a high intelligence stat to wield of course it does require high strength to use but that shouldn be an issue for strengthfocused builds the fallingstar beast jaw scales with both strength and dexterity and features a terrific ash of war gravity bolt this ash sees players send a bolt of lightning down onto enemies dealing physical magic and poise damageplayers can unlock this weapon by defeating the fullgrown fallingstar beast in mt gelmiranother earlygame weapon in elden ring reduvia is the clearcut best dagger players can wield in the lands between dexterity builds will be hardpressed to find a weapon that scales better with the attribute reduvia also has the bloodloss passive effect along with a great ash of war reduvia blood blood this ash gives players the ability to slash at enemies from a farther distance and can be used in rapid successionplayers can unlock reduvia by defeating bloody finger nerijus near the murkwater catacombs in limgravealthough the bow isn the most viable option there are still some solid weapons players can choose from if they going a ranged buildthe pulley bow is perhaps the best wellrounded bow in elden ring it deals decent physical damage for a standard bow and has the best range out of any bow in the game its level requirements are next to nothing scaling with both strength and dexterity players can use its ash of war mighty shot to inflict more damage onto enemies from a farther distance while it not the most interesting choice in the bowcrossbow category it arguably the top choiceplayers can unlock the pulley bow by going to the top of a siege tower around the mt gelmir campsite north of gelmir hero cavethere aren many axes available in elden ring but players found early on that the icerind hatchet was among the best weapons to use while the developers eventually nerfed the icerind axe it still viable in midapril what makes the icerind hatchet so powerful is its ash of war hoarfrost stomp this was a speedrunner dream utility as it allowed them and any other player to completely stop enemies from attacking once used players will stomp the ground staggering enemies with ice damage and eliminating chunks of hp the hatchet also deals passive frost damage as wellplayers can find the icerind axe in temple quarter of liurnia of the lakes inside of a ruined building chestthe last weapon category on this list is for mages only there are dozens of staffs in elden ring but one separates itself from the rest of the packeasily the best choice for sorcerers the meteorite staff has ridiculous scaling and overall stats it has an s scale rating for intelligence while boosting the power of gravity sorceries by this makes spells like rock sling and meteorite of astel even stronger than they already are to make the case for the meteorite staff stronger players can find it extremely early and equip any ash of war they want on it the only issue with the staff is that it can be upgraded so players might have to eventually find another staff to replace it like the one showcased belowplayers can loot the meteorite staff at street of sage ruins near sellia crystal tunnel in caelidif players want to grow out of the meteorite staff then they need to use the carian regal scepter this staff has the highest intelligence requirement of any staff but can deal massive damage and scales nicely with intelligence and sorcery while lusat glintstone staff does deal more damage the carian regal scepter comes with the spinning weapon ash of war which lets players spin the staff in front of them to deal with oncoming enemies this deals magic damage based on the player intelligencesorcery full moon sorceries will also get boosted by using the scepterplayers can acquire the carian regal scepter by defeating rennala queen of the full moon and trading in her remembrance to finger reader eniaelden ring guidesgamespot may get a commission from

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-how-to-beat-rennala-queen-of-the-full-moon/1100-6501316/,while not as grueling as elden ring other early fights like margit the fell omen or godrick the grafted rennala queen of the full moon can still put up quite a challenge depending upon your build despite her low health and simple mechanics this enchantress has high intelligence and a deadly assortment of spells and spirit ashes making it best to act quickly to defeat her it also a bit of a puzzle fight in the first phase making it very important to know what to do here a guide on how to beat elden ring fourth mandatory bossand gain the ability to reallocate your character skill pointsshortly after defeating the red wolf of redagon you find yourself closing in on rennala queen of the full moon luckily rennala isn nearly as complex evasive or swift as the bosses you bested thus far so feel free to let out a sigh a relief other than making sure you spend your runes and stock up on potions the only real preparation i recommend is making sure you are wearing armor with high magic defense if you a magic user yourself be sure to have a melee weapon onhand for the first phase of the battle and memorize rock sling to take down rennala as quickly as possibleyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing elden ring review in progressif you the type to summon spirit ashes the moment you leap into battle my first tip for you is to hold off for a bit the first phase of your fight against rennala features the sorceress in a room cluttered with her devoted disciples many of whom you needn concern yourself with attacking instead you going to want to focus on finding and taking down the students who are providing the enchantress with her golden forcefield to find them search for the three students with a golden aura around them you want to do this as quickly as possible because if you take too long rennala will turn a handful of students into powerful objects she propels at you while they aren too difficult to dodge it an added annoyance you don have to deal with if you work swiftly if you having difficulty locating them follow the direction of the books being thrown at youthey pretty hard to missafter you break the students concentration a simple physical attack does the trick well rennala will fall to the ground shattering her forcefield you have a fairly generous amount of time to get in some hits on her however be sure to not get too greedyonce you see the light reemerge from her back away quickly to avoid being hit by her areaofeffect attack once she is airborne again you will merely need to repeat the process until her health bar is depleteddon get too distracted by that gorgeous cutsceneyou got another fight coming up and this one is a bit trickier if you planning on using spirit ashes i recommend the lone wolf ashes if you have them summon them immediately before quickly dodging to avoid rennala energy beam following her energy beam attack rennala will cast a spell summoning a small moon she hides inside of before sending it your way be mindful of its blast radius which can be seen in the water as the moon grows closer to youin addition to these special attacks rennala will also cast two additional spells one that summons four small drops of energy that hone in after you and a much smaller version of her energy beam avoid these while closing in on her for an attack if you a melee fighter if you a magic user try firing off rock sling at her to take her down quickly while this process is fairly straightforward there one additional thing to look out for rennala spirit ashesthat right you not the only one who can summon help in this battle throughout the fight rennala will cycle between summoning a pack of wolves a giant a dragon and a bloodhound knight this is where you having your own spirit ashes out on the field comes in clutch while rennala focus hardly ever moves from being on you your spirit ashes serve as a great way to keep hers preoccupied overall rennala is a bit of a glass cannon possessing very little health but packing a decent punch the sooner you can end the battle the better so just focus on dodging and getting off hits when you canbesting the queen of the full moon will earn you a nottooshabby runes as well as two other important items the great rune of the unborn and remembrance of the full moon queen even more importantly however is that following your battle with rennala you gain the ability to speak to her after she becomes friendly with you you may consult with her to reallocate your skill points and change your character builda very useful feature if you find yourself not liking your composition following the first two dungeonsgamespot may get a commission from retail offersgot a

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-best-early-rune-farming-areas-to-level-up-fast/1100-6501200/,in elden ring you can feel overwhelmed especially early on with the enemies you face but through rune farming in key locations you can level yourself up more quickly and bring the hurt to those dastardly monsters and even bosses these runes are the sole currency you use to level up your character there are a few important tasks you need to do first in elden ring like making your way to the gatefront site of grace where you will get torrent the spectral horse and the ability to level up using runes from here you can make your way to a few different farming spots depending on how confident you are in your skillsthe best farming location early in the game is actually a higherlevel location that you can find your way to using a warp gate in order to get there you will need to find your way to the third church of marika located in east limgrave the easiest way to get here is to start at the gate front site of grace and follow the road path east after crossing over a bridge you will take the path north and continue following it until you run directly into the church this location is outside the first map fragment you find but you can get the map fragment for east limgrave by continuing to follow the path after the third church of marikaonce you get to the third church of marika you will want to head inside and activate the lost grace and grab the flask of wondrous physik since you are already here head to the river located on the north side of the church and follow it east until you find a warp gate located behind some trees this warp gate will take you to the bestial sanctumonce you arrive at the bestial sanctum there will be a towering enemy standing directly in front of you this is a boss you will not want to fight until much later in the game but luckily if you do not attack it or get close to it it will leave you alone the first thing you want to do is to turn around and head into the sanctum where you will find a site of grace and the gurranq beast clergyman who you don need to worry about right now after that head outside and start looking for some small blackhooded enemies standing around the area these enemies will be pretty tough for someone at a low level but they don have too much health they are also mostly standing alone so you can sneak up for a critical strikedepending on what weapon the enemy is wielding each one will net you between and runes which is a significant amount early in the game this area is also good because if you do get killed by one of them it easy to ride in on torrent snag your runes and ride out having the site of grace in the sanctum also means you can quickly reset the enemies there are a few other places to check out if this area proves too difficultthis next method offers players the chance to snag an easy runes as long as they are willing to go on a bit of a journey players will want to head to the eastern region of the map caelid players can find the area by taking the dirt road path northeast from limgrave the fort is located in the eastern section of caelid the site of grace is right outside the fort along with your target a massive sleeping dragon we have a complete standalone guide on this very special dragonif you approach the dragon backside from the site of grace you can stand next to it and continuously attack it without it attacking you or any other enemy attacking you depending on your level and your weapon this process will be time consuming if you have a weapon that inflicts blood loss use that to help speed up the process once the dragon is defeated it will die along with the smaller dragons that are on the other side of it netting you a cool runes once the dragon is killed it will not respawn nor will the smaller dragonsif you don kill the big dragon the smaller dragons can be farmed for runes each with there being five or six of them as long as the big dragon is left alive the smaller dragons will respawn whenever you go to a site of grace the downside here is that for early game players these smaller dragons will be pretty tough to kill even though they spawn with half of a health bar this farming method is better used later in the game so it will be up to you if you want to take the rune bonus early or wait to farm this area later onjust east of the gate front ruins you will find the agheel lake north site of grace just northeast of there is a small viking camp with a few horseback enemies between the camp and the site of grace each horseback enemy will net you about runes and clearing out the entire camp of the wolves and vikings will put at about runes per run the only enemies that are a bit challenging to beat are those on horseback but a couple jumping heavy attacks will knock them off their horses and leave them open to a critical hit unfortunately this method won get you runes as quickly as the aforementioned dragons but it will be much easier to do without dying the final method nets the lowest amount of runes but is easy and fastthe seaside ruins site of grace is located to the southeast of where the player first emerges into the lands between from this site of grace players will head east to find a group of knights fighting a group of goblins taking down the entire group will net players runes which is a pretty low amount the advantage to this method is that the enemies are distracted with killing each other so it easy to run in and start killing them before they start to focus on you you receive runes whenever an enemy dies nearby even if another enemy kills it the site of grace is nearby so a run should only take to minutes it not the most efficient method but it is the safestregardless of which method you choose getting some extra levels and stat points early on in elden ring will be useful especially when trying to beat the first main boss of the game margit

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-elden-ring-weapons-you-can-find-early-in-limgrave/1100-6500877/,the difference between life and death is sometimes as simple as what in your hand at the beginning of your journey in elden ring you be choosing a weapon that could be your goto monsterkiller for a good chunk of the game in fact it could last the entire game because of this and because the upgrade system requires rare resources you want to pick something you like and get the hang of it earlymaybe you looking to go with something massive and slow for big damage potential or perhaps you want to be swift and aggressive with a smaller dex weapon so that you can maintain plenty of mobility there are so many options you may even want to switch between styles on the flyas you emerge into limgrave though you may find yourself overwhelmed by how many places there are to go prompting you to wonder where you should go to get your hands on some solid weapons to use during the opening hours of your adventure luckily we got you covered with the five best weapons you can grab early in limgravethe twinblade is a deadly weapon with blades affixed to each side of the hilt and it requires strength and dexterity to wield it perfectly viable as a onehanded or twohanded weapon and provides rapid successive attacks with plenty of spinning animations for some unique visual flourish because it only requires strength it ideal for a dex build though the evenly balanced quality build can use it toothe default weapon skill for the twinblade is spinning slash which is a fastspinning attack that uses a decent chunk of fp but dishes out some hefty damage to enemies caught in the combothe dragonburnt ruins is basically just a collection of collapsed buildings with some weak enemies nearby so it shouldn pose much of an issue for you while riding torrent head to the ruins and navigate to the southernmost building and double jump inside head down into the basement to find the twinblade waiting for you to take it out for a spinreduvia is a powerful option for dagger users especially in the early game it helps that it an aesthetically intriguing weapon that will ensure you can look cool while dispatching enemiesreduvia requires strength and dexterity to wield its blood blade weapon skill is a ranged attack that uses a small amount of fp to fire bloody projectiles that cause bleeding to enemies bear in mind that it is unique to reduvia and can not be removed replaced transferred or found elsewheredefeating bloody finger nerijus isn too difficult simply dodge or block his flurry of attacks and then counter him with a few hits of your own eventually you be joined by an npc ally named yura who will help you tremendously in finishing off blood finger nerijus once and for all keep in mind though that yura may take a little time to get to you so you can always move south on the riverbed a bit to meet him halfway and get the fight done a little quicker either way finishing off the phantom earns you the bloodsoaked dagger you so desirethe longsword ranks among the most commonlyused weapons in all from software games and it for a good reason this standard straight sword requires strength and dexterity to wield and it has a great move set that is useful in nearly any scenariothe longsword weapon skill is square off which can be used to charge a powerful upward slash with or a dashing thrust with it simple but immensely effective in close quarters encounterskal sells a longsword at a reasonable price and he also carries a ton of other important items for the early part of your journey including a crafting kit and a torch for exploring dark areas so you want to farm up enough runes to buy everything he has as quickly as possiblethe flail features a spiked ball on a chain that looks like it would hurt really bad so it a good option for bringing the pain to your enemies it also a brand new weapon type in the from software game lineupthe flail requires strength and dexterity to wield its weapon skill is spinning chain which spins the striking part of the flail at high speed and can then combo into normal and heavy attacks for some pretty substantial damageyou can obtain the flail pretty much immediately after you emerged from the tutorial area into limgrave proper as it in a chest in a large camp nearby called the gateside ruinsyou can move around slowly and try to quietly take out each of the soldiers one at a time but if the trumpetwielding fellow in the middle happens to see you he announce your presence and the entire camp will come to lay the smackdown on you if that happens you can make an attempt to aoe them down in packs with magic or large vertical weapon swings or you could just run away and reset the areathe greataxe is a classic from software weapon that is known for trading slow swings for really high damage it requires a whopping strength but only dexterity to wieldbarbaric roar is the weapon skill that comes with the greataxe using it grants you a boost to attack power while also giving your heavy attacks powerful combos making it a very helpful tool if you can use it right before engaging an enemythe greataxe is found in a traveling carriage that makes its way along the main road to the east of agheel lake which itself is east of where you first emerge into limgrave rounding up the carriage may take a little time but it hard to miss the two giant trolls pulling it slowly along the road if you don see them at first just make your way down the path in both directions until you doyou need to kill at least one of the two trolls before the carriage will finally come to a full stop additionally there are other small enemies that travel alongside it but they easily killed so it might be worth dispatching all of them to make things less chaotic once the carriage is stopped and the area is safe wrap around to the backside of it to find a chest that can be

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/norco-review-deep-south-dystopia/1900-6417861/,i had never heard of the eponymous town of norco until playing the debut pointandclick adventure game from indie developer geography of robot now i feel like i know it intimately owing much to the game evocative and honest portrayal of a community intertwined with the petrochemical industry norco confronts societal issues other games only want to distract us from weaving them into an utterly compelling tale that had me eager to reach the next scene line of dialogue or delightful piece of prosethe reallife norco is a small town in louisiana that sits on the banks of the mississippi river its unusual name is derived from the new orleans refining company norco which was established in the area after the land was purchased by shell oil in for over a century the town has lived in the shadow of a major shell petroleum refinery that dominates the skyline coating the air in plumes of smoke that bellow from the plant monolithic flare stacksyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing norco exclusive gameplay trailer play for all provides a fascinating backdrop for a story that centers around kay a young woman returning to her childhood home after the passing of her mothera curious former professordue to cancer kay has been gone for five years preferring to drift around the united states rather than stay in norco despite the outside world being ravaged by localized wars kay arrives with some baggage then and it doesn take long before she saddled with her late mother mysterious affairs which revolve around her soughtafter research and strange activity in the days leading up to her death there also the matter of kay missing brother who is nowhere to be found spurring her into action as she embarks on a thrilling adventure across this small industrial slice of louisiananorco setting and themes mesh the grotesque and magical realism of the southern gothic genre with sciencefiction nihilism it set during some undetermined point in the near future denoted by the sentient security android in the backyard and a clinical service that lets people upload their consciousnesses to a smartphone app despite this norco authentic mundanity makes it feel more like our current reality than any scifi dystopia there the rotting corpse of a cockroach buried somewhere in the inner workings of the microwave in kay mother kitchen the beatup motorcycle out back in need of a fuse to get working again motels still equipped with landline phones a hot dog vendor desperate for someone to buy his decadeold sausages and a puppet theatre tucked beneath a busy overpassthe dystopian elements are instead grounded in reality norco is a town ravaged by frequent flooding and hurricanes many of its denizens have lost loved ones because of incidents caused by the oil refinery either due to exploding pipelines or the environmental decay that a major industrial operation will inevitably induce the game never comes across as preachy or condescending when exploring these issues climate change is a matter of fact and its effects are palpable nothing more needs to be said and the same is true of the other underlying themes norco deftly tackles whether it religion class divide gentrification materialism capitalism and so onall of this works because the writing throughout is so wonderful it dark and whimsical and frequently poetic the oddball cast of characters that accompany kay on her adventure are all nuanced and empathetically human whether you with them for a matter of seconds or for a couple of hours private investigator brett leblanc is a particular highlight his delusions of grandeur undercut by how much time he spends surveying the neighborhood while sitting on the toilet the garretts meanwhile are a cultlike gang of disillusioned youths who evolve from their early mall nazis moniker to become a band of miscreants simply seeking a sense of community in their own roundabout way for all of norco melancholy and sense of hopelessness it a genuinely funny game there a warmth and compassion that emanates from its characters and prevents the story inherent despair from becoming too overbearing even in its darkest moments there enough levity to pull you out of the miremechanically norco is quite simple as everything exists to serve the narrative it might be a pointandclick adventure game but it eschews many of the genre historic conventions while still remaining innately familiar you spend much of the game navigating each panel of the game gorgeous pixel art clicking around each scene to interact with objects in the environment speak to people and piece together memories and new ideas using dialogue choices in kay mindmap this functions as a journal of sorts giving you an easy way to revisit information and add new revelations as you uncover themthere are occasional puzzles where you might have to find an item and give it to someone or traverse the innards of a building in the pitchblack darkness by selecting different text prompts none of these conundrums are going to make you rack your brain and norco likes to hold your hand when the solution isn immediately obvious it safe to say you likely won ever feel lost which is a rarity for a pointandclick adventure game there very little backtracking and you won have to decipher how two seemingly disparate inventory items might combine solving these rudimentary puzzles isn particularly engaging but norco is driven by its narrative and many of the puzzles serve to enhance it choosing to focus on progressing the story over halting the player momentum with ambiguous puzzle design is a smart movebrief combat encounters rear their head a few times tasking you with completing a timing or memorybased minigame to deal damage to enemies these sequences feel slightly out of place due to their overly gamey nature but they few and far between enough to avoid overstaying their welcomenorco beautiful evocative and contemplative storytelling takes you on a fascinating journey that will occupy your thoughts for weeks and months after the credits roll it earns its place

the upgrade system requires rare resources you want to pick something you like and get the hang of it earlymaybe you looking to go with something massive and slow for big damage potential or perhaps you want to be swift and aggressive with a smaller dex weapon so that you can maintain plenty of mobility there are so many options you may even want to switch between styles on the flyas you emerge into limgrave though you may find yourself overwhelmed by how many places there are to go prompting you to wonder where you should go to get your hands on some solid weapons to use during the opening hours of your adventure luckily we got you covered with the five best weapons you can grab early in limgravethe twinblade is a deadly weapon with blades affixed to each side of the hilt and it requires strength and dexterity to wield it perfectly viable as a onehanded or twohanded weapon and provides rapid successive attacks with plenty of spinning animations for some unique visual flourish because it only requires strength it ideal for a dex build though the evenly balanced quality build can use it toothe default weapon skill for the twinblade is spinning slash which is a fastspinning attack that uses a decent chunk of fp but dishes out some hefty damage to enemies caught in the combothe dragonburnt ruins is basically just a collection of collapsed buildings with some weak enemies nearby so it shouldn pose much of an issue for you while riding torrent head to the ruins and navigate to the southernmost building and double jump inside head down into the basement to find the twinblade waiting for you to take it out for a spinreduvia is a powerful option for dagger users especially in the early game it helps that it an aesthetically intriguing weapon that will ensure you can look cool while dispatching enemiesreduvia requires strength and dexterity to wield its blood blade weapon skill is a ranged attack that uses a small amount of fp to fire bloody projectiles that cause bleeding to enemies bear in mind that it is unique to reduvia and can not be removed replaced transferred or found elsewheredefeating bloody finger nerijus isn too difficult simply dodge or block his flurry of attacks and then counter him with a few hits of your own eventually you be joined by an npc ally named yura who will help you tremendously in finishing off blood finger nerijus once and for all keep in mind though that yura may take a little time to get to you so you can always move south on the riverbed a bit to meet him halfway and get the fight done a little quicker either way finishing off the phantom earns you the bloodsoaked dagger you so desirethe longsword ranks among the most commonlyused weapons in all from software games and it for a good reason this standard straight sword requires strength and dexterity to wield and it has a great move set that is useful in nearly any scenariothe longsword weapon skill is square off which can be used to charge a powerful upward slash with or a dashing thrust with it simple but immensely effective in close quarters encounterskal sells a longsword at a reasonable price and he also carries a ton of other important items for the early part of your journey including a crafting kit and a torch for exploring dark areas so you want to farm up enough runes to buy everything he has as quickly as possiblethe

gateside ruinsyou can move around slowly and try to quietly take out each of the soldiers one at a time but if the trumpetwielding fellow in the middle happens to see you he announce your presence and the entire camp will come to lay the smackdown on you if that happens you can make an attempt to aoe them down in packs with magic or large vertical weapon swings or you could just run away and reset the areathe greataxe is a classic from software weapon that is known for trading slow swings for really high damage it requires a whopping strength but only dexterity to wieldbarbaric roar is the weapon skill that comes with the greataxe using it grants you a boost to attack power while also giving your heavy attacks powerful combos making it a very helpful tool if you can use it right before engaging an enemythe greataxe is found in a traveling carriage that makes its way along the main road to the east of agheel lake which itself is east of where you first emerge into limgrave rounding up the carriage may take a little time but it hard to miss the two giant trolls pulling it slowly along the road if you don see them at first just make your way down the path in both directions until you doyou need to kill at least one of the two trolls before the carriage will finally come to a full stop additionally there are other small enemies that travel alongside it but they easily killed so it might be worth dispatching all of them to make things less chaotic once the carriage is stopped and the area is safe wrap around to the backside of it to find a chest that can be opened to obtain

borderlands has delved into a realm of high fantasydeveloper gearbox software initially explored this genre in the borderlands dlcturnedspinoff tiny tina assault on dragon keep back in almost a decade later gearbox is venturing back into the tabletop board game of bunkers badasses for a selfcontained tale of swords sorcery and the power of stories while it has inherited a number of the more annoying borderlands quirks wonderlands is still a comfortably familiar experience that wears its passion for tabletop gaming on its sleeveas a standalone borderlands spinoff wonderlands doesn require knowledge of previous borderlands games to jump into instead of focusing on a story about vault hunters pursuing alien ruins that house artifacts of incredible power wonderlands shifts the focus to recurring sidecharacter tiny tina and her latest tabletop gaming session all of this takes place in a game that closely follows the borderlands lootandshoot gameplay formulaconstantly collecting new

again calling the shots as the bunker master and alongside the characters of valentine and frettevoiced by andy samberg and wanda sykesit up to you to become the fatemaker who is destined to save the land from the menace of the evil dragonlordborderlands has always had a strong connection to the rpg genre with its deep and varied character builds so a swerve from postapocalyptic scifi to the tonally opposite field of fantasy isn jarring and in fact meshes naturally with the lootandshoot gameplay of gearbox popular franchise this is still a borderlands game at its core and if you spent a few hours scouring the planet of nekrotafeyo looking for typhon deleon audio logs while fending off maliwan troopers in borderlands then that muscle memory will quickly kick in when you start playing wonderlandsevery aspect of wonderlands is familiar but with a tiny tina visual redesign layered on top of it forget about shields you protected from some harm thanks to various wards although there are still guns grenades are out replaced instead with a book of rechargeable spells that give you the ability to liveaction roleplay a fireball into a goblin face or tear the ground asunder with dark magic might artifacts rings and necklaces confer more bonuses on your character known as a fatemaker and as you expect from borderlands there an arsenal of weapons out there to collect and experiment withthe wonderlands stockpile doesn fully commit to the bit though as outside of the fantasy facelift these guns still perform as you expect them to gun manufacturer brands such as dahl vladof and bandit still feature the same characteristics as their borderlands counterparts while newer brands such as swift arken and bonk give you protective magical and melee options remember you can never go wrong with a bonk macethat slot for melee combat is an intriguing addition to the meatandpotatoes gunplay that wonderlands has inherited from borderlands getting up close and personal with enemies in previous borderlands games was a risky tactic reserved for characters with suitable skilltrees like and krieg but in wonderlands it pays to focus on making certain that your sword is just as sharp as your sorcery combined with the longdistance gunplay wonderlands has a satisfyingly chunky rhythm to its chaotic action once you invested some time in growing your fatemaker skillsafter a few hours i found my groove and felt like a warrior of legend i charge into the thick of battle slide my way in with a submachine gun and unleash freezing bolts of action in my path following up with enemyshattering blows from my cleaver a snap of my fingers to cast armormelting acid bomb spells and quick activation of my action skill to polymorph a troll into a very confused sheep and i was a force to be reckoned with on the battlefieldjust don expect your character builds in wonderlands to reach the same level of godlike power that the vault hunters of borderlands were capable of hitting while every member of the borderlands troop had three skill trees to pour a considerable number of points intofour if you purchased the designer cut of the gamethe fatemaker classes have a more singular focus in comparison each of the game six classes is highly tuned to focus on a key fantasy archetype but once you sunk some time into growing your fatemaker you soon be able to wield the power of an additional classfor example the spellshot class is a dab hand at firing off spells and stacking buffs to increase the power of these arcane skills and when combined with the glass cannon skills of the graveborn you able to bolster these skills at the cost of your health alternatively a critical hitfocused stabbomancer who runs cold with the brrzerker melee talents can strike from the shadows with frigid ferocity while a spore warden who combines clawbringer skills with their offense is a fungal lightning rod of destructive powerthese character builds require a significant investment of time to truly reach their peak but once you reached a high enough level and have found the right loot they creatively chaotic with the devastation that you can reachrunning spellshot and graveborn traits allowed me to build a spellslinging wizard rapidly reduce the cooldown on my magic and augment my sorcery with lifestealing skills that could keep me in the fight for longer equipped with the right gear each spell amplified my gun damage while i summoned meteors from the sky and turned the battlefield into a volcanic landscapeadmittedly each fatemaker class pales in comparison to the flexibility of the borderlands vault hunters but the gear you randomly acquire mostly fills this gap there an element of chance to all of this though so the odds of spending hours hunting for that one legendary that perfectly slots into your current character build can be a tiresome grind with a level cap of you have to think very carefully about where you want to apply your limited number of skill points across those two character classes while you have to consider which base class you start the game with you never be locked to your secondary class as a respec machine in brighthoof is always availablefor a modest fee of courselike borderlands and its impressive expansion episodes wonderlands also boasts some scenic vistas to explore each location still follows the atypical borderlands environment design template of long stretches that you sprint through before you reach an arena in which to ply your deadly fatemaker trade and you can bet your favorite die that each location has a few secrets to uncover although these boil down to audio logs and secret die that can marginally increase your luck at finding better lootall of these locations are inspired by decades of fantasy material drawing from the fantasy genre to create caverns that are home to rampaging trolls spooky beaches populated by phantom pirates and forests filled with homicidal mushrooms these are linked together by the overworld a slice of tabletop tourism that has even more explorative elements to dig into more sidequests to engage in and secrets to uncover considering that wonderlands has no vehicles for you to collect and pilot the overworld essentially functions as a means for quick travel and discovery where you can pick up more sidequests and take part in and grind for experience points in dungeons dotted along the mapthe overworld is a section of the game that really captures the scrappy nature of wonderlands as its construction is a mixture of storebought rpg decorations and discarded popcorn all held together with duct tape and sheer pluck it essentially the core wonderlands experience distilled into a more easily accessible format but its appeal quickly fades away once you unlocked all the fasttravel options present in the game while it charming in demonstrating gearbox love for classic roleplaying games it ultimately pointless in the wonderlands endgamewonderlands picks up a few bad habits from borderlands in its story and how it tells its tale there tonal whiplash that you have to deal with regularly as the game repeatedly shifts from lighthearted fantasy fun to bickering party members dealing with personal issues that threaten to derail the entire tabletop session when wonderlands focuses on the absurd imagination of tinawonderfully brought to life once again by the energetic voice performance of ashly burchit can be hilarious fun to sit throughthere are moments that recapture the silliness of borderlands like mr torgue bardbarian character casting a magic intercontinental ballistic missile spell powered by friendship or claptrap various sidequests that always end with disastrous and hilarious results these are juxtaposed by an effort to recapture the emotional beats of assault on dragon keep but the clumsy execution of haphazardly inserting drama feels jarring at best even with the assistance of a great villain brought to life by the gravely vocal talents of best batman will arnett these moments of tina building a world where she can vent her insecurities and fears fall flatwhereas dragon keep dealt with tina inability to cope with the death of a major borderlands cast member wonderlands focuses on her fear of being abandoned by her friends and new family its content that has the potential to be a heartfelt exploration of tina but any exploration of these themes is briefly touched upon before being jettisoned into the voidthe mountains of exposition you have to deal with also have the habit of making what should be an easily digestible game feel longer than a marathon viewing of the lord of the rings trilogy extended editions even though the main story clocks in at a breezy hours you swear that you spent twice as long listening to characters awkwardly use ye olde medieval speak to ask for your help in slaying ancient dragon godsthe story content itself dips into the borderlands bag of parody selfreferential humor internet memes and tina ability to create new wordchimeras on the fly in her general dialogue if you weren a fan of this style of cheeky humor in the borderlands games the fantasyfueled satire is unlikely to win you over either credit to gearbox for going allin on these jokes though as wonderlands unashamedly skewers the genre it set in with quests that range from goblin liberation to helping a steampowered version of claptrap find his sultry negotiating voicethat modest campaign lengthwhich is home to a handful of superb boss fightsis bolstered by a number of sidequests that vary in length in typical gearbox fashion the entire fantasy genre is parodied with the missions that you be able to engage in which include helping a band of goblins fight for their rights assisting gerritt of trivia while he constantly berates you and the odd bout of demonic possession don expect major changes to the mission structure as a typical wonderlands quest consists of reaching a location annihilating anything with even a shred of hostility listening to some more exposition and then repeating the formula it wouldn be too grating if the rewards at the end of these missions made the repetitive grind worthwhile but the prize for a slog through dangerous territory is usually mediocre gear at bestwonderlands even ventures into roguelike territory with the chaos chamber a selection of gauntlets that offer plenty of loot cash and experience points to acquire if you prepared to increase the challenge in each stage and face escalating opposition along the way just like borderlands you can even take the elements from the chaos chamber and apply them to the lands that you previously explored in what wonderlands calls chaos mode for even more opportunity at increasing your fatemaker powerchaos mode modifiers transform wonderlands into a more challenging game buffing enemy health resilience and the damage that they can unleash on you beyond those standard increases in difficulty some of the wilder changes include stages having more traps present dying enemies firing off heatseeking magic missiles and gaining increased armor to a specific element the more you use it each chaos mode level offers bonus experience points and better loot if you survive but the only way to increase those numbers is by successfully completing a run in a specific iteration of the chaos chamberthe chaos chamber distills the entire game experience into a single minute gauntlet of danger one where you thrown headfirst into arenas that have the potential to be lucrative both financially and in terms of the gear that you can earn along the way it a wonderlands arms race without having to sit through boringly verbose sections as you constantly chase the thrill of unlocking gear with higher numbers better stats and more exotic abilities as an endgame experience it a fun and snacksized version of wonderlands although its appeal will likely only have staying power with players who are looking to create the ultimate fatemaker buildas a spinoff tiny tina wonderlands doesn reinvent the borderlands wheel with its shift towards fantasy that bears a chaoticneutral alignment instead it explores familiar territory that repeats the best and worst of the borderlands formula and it doesn venture out of its comfort zone that makes for a game that is packed with solid firstperson shooter action and a competent multiclass system for creating an interesting fatemaker tiny tina wonderlands retreads the same mechanical and narrative ground as borderlands ultimately creating a

ethan winters rather than one of the series longtime protagonists resident evil village is a unique mashup of several different horror games in one it has the atmospheric tensionbuilding pure terror of pt as well as the allout action of some of the later resident evil games as well as the constant hideandseek segments made famous in resident evil none of these happen at the same time but rather than make village feel scattershot this design decision keeps it from ever feeling stale over its playtime it gets pretty goofy even for a resident evil game but capcom clarity of vision means the series is in very good shapesee our resident evil village reviewsea of thieves has come a long way since launching in rare has turned sea of thieves from a somewhat shallow pirate adventure into a swashbuckling success thanks to steady updates that have drastically overhauled the experience most importantly sea of thieves now has an abundance of content ranging from story missions to skeleton

realtime combat featuring more elaborate systems tales of arise also features one of the best cast of characters from the series in a long time make no mistake this is still a lengthy jrpg and does

slightly lower resolution and these visual enhancements make like a dragon world more vibrant and detailed sega has never been afraid to take risks with the quirky and moving yakuza franchise and like a dragon takes the biggest risk in franchise history by moving away from beatup combat in favor of a turnbased rpg system the change funnels in from the personality of the new protagonist ichiban kasuga ichiban mind often wanders and he sees himself as a hero ripped out of dragon quest this in turn shifts enemies into silly beings that are fought using an oldschool turnbased system ichiban personality is infectious and the partybased system leads to some of the best interpersonal moments in franchise history yakuza like a dragon may play wildly differently than previous entries in the

vr headset this holiday we here to help you pick the right one the last couple of years have been great for vr with the release of stellar oculus quest and great virtual reality experiences such as halflife alyx and resident evil vr the quest leads the way on our best vr headsets list but there are other options that are worth considering too check out our vr headset recommendations belowthe first thing that important to know before buying a vr headset is that some vr games are exclusive to specific headsets oculus and playstation vr both have their own storefronts that offer unique games unavailable to htc valve and other companies headsets of course you can still get an impressive experience with the valve index or htc vive line of headsets especially considering the great library of vr games on steam each vr headset has its advantages and unique qualities such as high resolutions amoled displays and builtin speakersthe oculus quest is a powerful mobile vr headset that gives you great experiences without connecting to a pcno sensors required the valve index requires you to connect to a pc and use sensors but it also provides the most highend vr experience available today and of course there playstation vr which has the benefit of being compatible with sony firstparty lineup of vr games each headset has its unique features and benefits so you need to decide which one is the best for you based on your price rangewhether you looking for a vr headset you can play anywhere and want something better than gear vr a highend headset for the most immersive experience and motion controls on your gaming pc or something in between there are plenty of vr goggles to choose from while the early days of vr gaming made us choose between the oculus rift htc vive and gear vr more companies have entered the space valve stepped out on its own with the index samsung created a windows mixed reality headset with the samsung hmd odyssey and sony released its playstation vr which has proved fairly popular among players and will be compatible with check out some of our top picks for belowthe goodthe badthe oculus quest is a fantastic vr headset that shows you don need a gaming pc for compelling vr experiencesand thanks to oculus link you can still connect to a gaming pc and enjoy everything pc vr offers as well now facebook has improved on the original standalone headset design in some great ways making the oculus quest the definitive version of the company vr headset unfortunately you do have to log into a facebook account to use itin addition to an increased resolution of per eye oculus plans to implement support for games in the near futureat launch you be able to interact with system software like the home hub and browser in as an experimental feature you also get a headset equipped with a faster qualcom snapdragon processor and of ram up from the new fastswitch lcd displays may not be oled but they still look fantastic once you adjusted the comfortable new backpacklike strap and selected one of three interpupillary distance settingsi felt that my ipd was slightly off at first and while your experience may still vary i was able to solve my issue after adjusting the headset and strapthe oculus quest is an improvement on the original in almost every way but if you upgrading from the quest you may not be as blown away by the newer oculus vr machine that speaks to the quality of the quest more than anything as it still an excellent headset that won leave its owners feeling left out the quest is more of a smart iteration on the original than a true nextgen vr headset there are also a lot of great games coming to the quest platform all of which will be compatible with both headsets and the quest will receive continued support for the foreseeable futureafter relaunching following a brief hiatus due to some users experiencing skin irritation the oculus quest is available again in and models our oculus quest review for morethe goodthe badthe oculus rift s is the company pcpowered headset which means it lacks the versatility of a standalone vr headset like the quest however you still don need to worry about sensors oculus has gone allin on insideout tracking so all of its headsets are free to roam any space that has enough roomor that the rift s cable is long enough to reachthe rift s comes with its own touch controller set and has access to the oculus store vr apps in addition to any other compatible game or app from any storefront on pc this includes the vast majority of steamvr games the resolution comes in at with a refresh rate of big question is why would you go with the rift s if the quest can connect to a pc do everything the rift s can and also live as a standalone headset well the main reason is that the quest oculus link is still in beta and while impressive is not always the most stable experience especially if you step outside of the oculus ecosystem of apps if you want a perfectly stable pc vr experience right now and access to the oculus store apps then the oculus rift s is one of the best vr systems you can getthe goodthe badin terms of pure technical prowess the valve index is without a doubt the best gameroriented vr headset on the market it doesn increase the resolution past on its lcd display but the index nails vr where it most important refresh rate and field of view boasting a max refresh rate and a field of view of it makes for the best smoothestfeeling experience in virtual reality with the higher field of view you can see more of the game at any one time as opposed to the relative tunnel vision found in other headsets an index and a good gaming pc will provide the optimal vr experience assuming you okay with a few wires and spending big on a pc gaming rig and the tethered headset experienceanother key aspect of the device is its unique motion controller which features individual finger tracking and is a step up from something like the oculus touch there aren a lot of applications for this yet but fingertracking is a great way to make your virtual reality experience more immersivegames like boneworks use it well and while it absolutely usable in seated or stationary settings it excels most with roomscale vr thus gamers without a lot of space may find it hard to push the index to its full potentialthe valve index also needs to be powered by a pc with a wired connection at the moment there is no option for wireless use as the vive wireless adaptermade for htc vive headsetsis incompatible however the valve index is compatible with the htc vive controllers and base stations so valve offers the index headset on its own and in a kit additionally the valve index controllers and base stations are compatible with htc vive headsetsthe valve index vr kit comes with the headset controllers a powerful pair of builtin speakers that make it easy to enter the virtual world without totally disconnecting from the real one and base stations every purchase of the index kit headset and controllers also comes with a complimentary copy of halflife alyx on steam letting you continue the story of that character right awaythe goodthe badthe successor to the original htc vive the htc vive pro is another highend vr headset and while the valve index features a higher refresh rate and wider field of view the vive pro boasts something no other headset does an amoled display this means you see brighter colours and better contrast than the valve index the vive pro is more expensive than the valve index so you need to decide if that outweighs the index high refresh rate and field of viewone thing that great about the vive pro is that the index unique hand controllers will work with it and the original vive so you don have to drop the cash to upgrade to the full index kityou can simply spend to get the index controllers and if you want to go wirefree htc does feature a capable wireless adapterthough it is sold separately for that said the regular vive controller set is still solidevery purchase of a new htc vive series headset comes with a sixmonth subscription to viveport infinity which is a service that gives users access to a library of vr games and apps being able to test a bunch of different vr headset experiences before making any purchases is extremely valuable especially if you new to the technology for example it can be difficult to know how you be able to handle certain games and different types of locomotionthe goodthe badthe vive cosmos is htc answer to oculus line of vr headsets like the quest and rift s it utilizes insideout tracking which means no sensors are necessary however it does feature greater specs than the rift s boasting a resolution and refresh ratefor reference the rift s features a resolution and refresh rateanother thing the vive cosmos has on the rift s is its modular capability its front faceplate can be removed and replaced with different mods though there is only one announced at this time the external tracking faceplate which lets you use the vive controllers and base stations with your cosmos and like the vive pro the cosmos can also make use of htc wireless adapterone of the greatest conveniences with this vive vr device is the ability to flip the headmounted display upward freeing your view for the real world vr can be an isolating experience so being able to easily flip it up when your smartphone starts ringing or someone knocks on your door is a feature that easy to appreciateunfortunately the cosmos comes at a much higher price than its closest competition the oculus rift s the cosmos costs more than the rift s price tag that price includes a sixmonth subscription to viveport infinitythe goodthe badwindows mixed reality combines virtual reality vr and augmented reality ar into one headset though the vast majority of its applications are in vr the best of the mixed reality headsets which also includes devices like the microsoft hololens is definitely the samsung hmd odyssey howeverthe samsung hmd odyssey features dual amoled displays which produce vibrant colours additionally it boasts a combined resolution of field of view and refresh rate of up to which is a lower hz refresh rate than other wired headsets like the rift s and cosmos it utilizes sensorfree insideout tracking and must be powered by a pc it compatible with the vast majority of steamvr games in addition to microsoft own windows mixed reality softwareunfortunately it not the most comfortable to wear and the headset and motion controllers don feel as wellmade as say the htc vive vr headsets it a hard sell at the regular price especially when the oculus rift s and quest can be picked up for cheaper thankfully samsung hmd odyssey is regularly discounted we seen it for as low as which is an excellent deal for what you get if your heart is set on the hmd odyssey and you patient then it worth picking up at that lower pricethe goodthe badthe playstation vr headset is compatible with the as well as backwardscompatible games on though sony has also confirmed that a nextgen psvr headset specifically for is in developmentas of now playstation vr is the lowestend headset in terms of specs combined resolution refresh rate and a field of view the low resolution and pixel density cause a significant screendoor effectyou see the black space between each pixel it makes it look like you viewing the game through a screen door this can be frustrating for experienced vr users but with no other vr headset on the it an issue you just have to deal with but where psvr falls short in its specs it makes up for in its exclusive games these titles feature some of the best experiences in vr and are well worth playing if you own sony vr headset the playstation move controllers are required for some gameslike farpoint and concrete geniebut there are plenty of great titles that use the dualshock including astro bot rescue mission and resident evil biohazard unfortunately psvr is the only platform on this list that isn compatible with valve halflife alyx one of the best vr games in recent memorythe psvr requires the playstation camera for tracking but thankfully it included with the headset in most bundles and if you already own a playstation camera for the then you ready to go no matter which version of it you have the tracking isn up to par with pc vr options especially when turning your face away from the camera though it does work fine for most gaming thankfully wearing the headset is extremely comfortable which makes longer sessions much more manageablemore tech picks from gamespotgot a news tip or want to contact us directly email news ,Best VR Headset 2021: Oculus Quest 2 Would Make A

casts you in the role of a historical leader such as egypt cleopatra or india gandhi and tasks you with building your civilization from the ground up including growing your military developing new research facilities and engaging in diplomacy with other world leaders of course civilization vi expanded and improved on previous games in the series with additions such as the inclusion of districts

offensive though csgo has undergone significant changes over its lifespan it still very much the core counterstrike experience that revolutionized the multiplayer fps genre in the the standard mode of play is a fiveonfive demolitionstyle match on carefully crafted maps that emphasize specific positioning sightlines and team strategies but beyond that there a hostage rescue mode gungame freeforall and tons of custom content from years of work by its player baseone of the most exciting things about csgo is the highintensity competitive matches where the slightest mistakes could spell doom for your team or clutch plays could drastically shift the momentum of a match counterstrike has historically been played with a level of precision in both the fps combat and in its tactics which makes a bit of a steep learning curve for newcomers however this classic game can be wildly rewarding which you can see from its massive competitive scene recently valorant has adopted the counterstrike formula to great effect but the highstakes tactical combat of csgo is still in a league of its own michael highamsee our counterstrike global offensive reviewarkane studios became the name to beat

best deathloop homicidal groundhog day appeal is amplified by its terrific cast layered levels of gameplay hidden secrets and so much moresee our deathloop reviewdespite releasing more than three years ago destiny remains one of the most popular live service multiplayer games around while the sequel started off on a strong note it has only gotten better thanks to consistent updates and expansions that delivered a steady stream of enthralling firstperson shooter content and it not even close to being too late to jump into destiny as multiple expansions are still incoming over the

original sin is an alltime great rpg giving you a huge range of freedom in how to build your party deal with a combat scenario and approach a given situation it a game best played on pc thanks to its crisper visuals the precision of using a mouse and faster loading times which encourage you to experiment with its wide range of possibilities while truly a great game overall much of the fun in

considerations that deepen the experience beyond simply being an fpsoverwatch presentation will draw you in with colorful detailed maps and heroes you grow to love just from playing them like any ongoing multiplayer game balance is always shifting but overwatch always seems to strike it extremely well while fostering a sharp focus on the team it has a rich history of seasonal content and special events that keep it fresh and even after five years it going strong michael highamsee our overwatch reviewportal remains one of the funniest and most inventive puzzlers in games it successfully built on the mindbending multidimensional ideas of the first game and somehow elevated its storytelling and characterization to become incredibly fun and memorable those things alone would make portal worthy of your attention but there additional content that comes with playing the game on pc not only is there online and local coop that extend the game beyond its singleplayer

whatever they want as they set out onto the frontier as arthur morgan the game is also gorgeous especially on pc for those with a capable enough rig the sweeping mountain visits and bubbling rivers shine on pc making red dead redemption one of the best games we can recommend on pc eddie makuchsee our red dead redemption reviewa departurethough not a complete departurefrom its previous games from softwares sekiro shadows die twice takes the simple act of blocking an attack and turns it into a thrilling gameplay mechanic battles against bosses are not simply marathons to whittle down their health but an exercise in perfection as you time your own attacks parry your enemys and then deliver a final killing blow on pc you can mod the game to speed up the pace or play as goofy characters who definitely dont belong in its somber violent universe without a dedicated easy mode in the settings which is itself a subject of debate the pc versions modding potential also lets you lower the difficulty gabe gurwinsee our sekiro shadows die twice reviewit starts with an old brokendown farm and a handful of seeds you clear out the weeds and rocks until you get tired and then you do it again you get into the rhythm of daily lifevisiting friends watering crops occasional light spelunking before you know it it been hours and you mostly managing your complex irrigation system and planning for next season harvest stardew valley is a friendly relaxing experience that also somehow manages to be endlessly addicting fans know the feeling of assuring themselves they play just one more day before bed and while it appeared on just about every platform pc often gets the first chance to test all of the little qualityoflife tweaks and new features that come with patchesmost recently the massive update appeared on pc almost two months before consoles plus there a huge library of mods that let you tweak various gameplay elements give the game a new aesthetic and even add extensive new content and characters see stardew valley expanded keeping up with stardew valley on pc is the best way to make sure your farming life never gets stale steve wattssee our stardew valley reviewit true that since its release in the elder scrolls v skyrim has been ported to just about every platform that can play games including amazon alexa speakers and smart refrigerators but the king of all skyrim versions is the one on pc and it not even close that because the pc version gives you access to years of mods created by the skyrim community from adding serious rpg story content to providing ridiculous possibilities like replacing all dragons with thomas the tank engine the pc version of skyrim adds nearly endless options to an already expansive enormous game you absolutely should play skyrim on pc if you haven and you absolutely should mod it to see how the game has become so much more than it was when it was released skyrim is also available with xbox game pass for pc phil hornshawsee our the elder scrolls v skyrim reviewone of the best rpgs of all time the witcher wild hunt brings the incredible story of geralt of rivia to a close the witcher puts geralt on a quest to find ciri a witcher in training who like a daughter to him he reconnects with old flames friends and adversaries as he searches far and wide for her of course there an abundance of side quests and characters to meet along the way which will undoubtedly keep you busy for hours many of these quests require you to slay monsters a witcher main trade and you have to prepare accordingly to defeat them by sword witcher magic and potions all thisand we didn even get into the two excellent expansionsmakes the witcher wild hunt an essential pc game mat pagetsee our the witcher wild hunt reviewvalheim took steam by storm selling more than million copies and earning an overwhelmingly positive rating from reviews in its first months of early access that may seem unbelievable but when you step into the world of valheim and explore its mysterious forests mountains and hills it becomes intimately clear how special it is valheim is full of secrets which you discover as you slay monsters collect resources and build yourself a viking village slowly peeling back the fog of this world is tremendously satisfying as finding new lands enemies and resources that help bolster your crafting menu and arsenal the latter of which you need to master and utilize to fend off the deadly beasts that call valheim home but you won have to go it alone as you can invite up to nine friends to join you on your server for viking adventures and good times mat pagetthe initial response to valorant was that it basically a mashup where overwatch meets counterstrikeand yeah that pretty accurate that also a good thing because valorant draws on many of the strengths of those games to make something unique it focuses on the roundbased demolitionstyle game mode with two teams of five attackers and defenders on balanced maps with specific lanes and sightlines and an extremely fast timetokill however each agent or character has their own unique abilities that add another strategic layer to combat team composition plays a major role and each agent affects what the team is capable of in each highstakes situation it intense and demanding but so rewardingvalorant is still early in its lifespan but we seen content updates and changes in its first year and it been quite successful so you can expect the game to get more support moving forward if a competitive fps with layered tactics precise gunplay and intense moments is your thing valorant is worth a try michael highamsee our valorant reviewfinding the right balance in a strategy game is extremely difficult as the best ones are challenging enough to necessitate smart play without being too punishing xcom very nearly falls into the too punishing camp but its mix of turnbased tactics combat and overarching management gameplay rarely feel unfair set after the first game when aliens have nearly completely conquered earth xcom certainly casts you as an underdog but it gives you the tools you need to take the fight to the invaders with careful planning ambushing a squad and delivering a mix of longrange sniping shots and explosive damage is immensely satisfying and even more so if youve struggled on the same map for an hour or more the game is certainly playable on consoles but its at home on pc as are developer firaxis other games moving your units around and getting a view of the whole battlefield is

more new locations including dig site which hosts the skeletons of massive creatures also players will immediately notice that warzone skybox has changed to tease a storm on the horizon there is also a new sabotage contract that gives players a vehicle target somewhere on the map players who successfully destroy the target will get an armored truck delivered via planein terms of general changes the season update allows players to use the gas mask while pulling their parachute while the most wanted contract sees its timer reduced what more players who successfully earn their way out of the gulag will now return to the game more closely to their team or dropped loadout elsewhere the season update does away with the confirmation ui when making a purchase from a buy station developer raven software said this extra step was causing unnecessary frictionthere are many fixes in the new season update as well including a fix for a bug that caused players to become stuck in aa turrets if they interact with it at the same time it was destroyed the update also fixes a problem that made players clip into stairsseason also adds new weapons including the marksman rifle and the nikita avt assault rifle while some weapons have seen balance changes the light machine gun charlie sees its max damage decreased to while the sakura round mags have their horizontal recoil control decreased to

infil to draw players towards new loot locations we have been happy with the results of these honeypot opportunities but we want to take it a step further starting with operation monarch we will be introducing high value loot zones to provide new fruitful opportunities for players willing to take the riskgeneral adjustmentsthe gas mask remains a continued focus for our quality of life efforts it plays an important role both in gameplay and the visceral call of duty feeling but we felt that we had seen one too many videos of players jumping from high heights into the gas and the game incorrectly prioritizing the gas mask animation over the parachute and we all know how that scenario endswe reviewed the data for the most wanted contract and we felt that improvements needed to be made to increase its engagement and success rate whilst still retaining the all important riskreward that it offerscaldera adjustmentsloot that spawns across caldera have been adjustedwe want to further increase the value and rewards of looting during the midgame its important for both pacing and movement in battle royale that there are always new rewards to be found for players who rotate through locations for greater loot advantages and our first step on this path is to bring single perks into loot from our internal testing this change has brought a wealth of new player stories and we will continue to roll out additional perks in this manner as we review player feedback and data on how it improves the pacing and experience of battle royale these lootable perks will launch first in caldera and then to rebirth island at a later daterebirth island adjustmentswhilst spawn protection plays an important role in any multilife game mode we felt it needed some extra refinement to make sure it cannot be exploited by players we will continue to monitor player behavior in this area and make further changes throughout the season if requiredlater this seasonthe confirmation box when making a buy station purchase had good intentions but we felt that the muscle memory had become so ingrained in players to doubletap twice in succession this was causing unnecessary friction in a potentially hostile combat situation versus the unlikelihood of mistakes being made we plan to make additional refinements to the buy station experience during the seasonfor a list of other known issues please check out our dedicated trello boardnew weaponsnew unlock challenge missionsweapon adjustments assault rifles the assault rifle bravo vg has considerable close to midrange

substantial headshot multiplier handgun charlie vg was able to achieve primary weapon ttks with little downside we will be closely monitoring the weapons performance and make further adjustments if necessary light machine guns light machine gun charlie vg has overstayed its welcome as the goto long range choice its high damage profile paired with the ability to load it out to remove most recoil

unfortunately diluted the sniper class into one important metric speed to click headsas mentioned above snipers may now use damage ranges as a defining characteristic of their oneshot potential this not only brings more identity to each weapon but means attachments that provide the lighter and quicker sniper rifles the damage range stat will increase their ability to one shot at increased

the submachine gun charlie vg and would often shred the target upper body far outside of its maximum damage range the vdd still provides a large bonus against extremities and still increases both the min damage and optimal damage range of the we expect continued use of this attachment even with these adjustments marksman rifles this slight change to the damage profile results in requiring one less

notice kal the merchant is asleep the area is surrounded by fog and a glowing blue woman is sitting nearbythis is ranni the witch speak with her to obtain the spirit bell and unlock spirit ash summons these ashes let you call a variety of support npcs into battle ranging from a troupe of wandering sorcerers to wolves and even jellyfish spirit ashes can be upgraded later and using them is essential

small shack roderika the woman inside is essentially your unofficial tutorial to how side quests work in elden ring speak with her a few times and youll learn shes interested in chrysalid items speak

call this area home making it a decent spot for some earlygame rune farming there are two staircases leading down in the ruinsthe northern one takes you into a chamber filled with rats and the

friendly npc will join you and distract nerijus letting you attack mostly without fear of reprisalonce nerijus is defeated youll obtain the reduvia dagger it scales with dexterity and arcane and what it lacks in sheer power it makes up for by letting you inflict bleed on enemies even if your arcane stat is a bit low you can still make use of the weapon and its effectmurkwater cave is near the site where you battle nerijus its a short dungeon that culminates in a battle against patches the tarnished merchant he begs you to spare him towards the end of the fight and you should leave the area rest at a site of grace and come back to purchase some helpful items from patches among these is margits shackle a unique item you can use twice during the first scripted boss fight to freeze margit in place for a few seconds it has a steep price tag of runes thoughupgrading weapons is essential and to do that youll need smithing stones most regions have at least one mine or tunnels dungeon where you can find smithing stones both in the environment and as loot from enemies melee classes beware though the enemies in limgrave tunnels are resistant to most physical attacks but are vulnerable to magicif you fancy investing in your intelligence stat you can find a glintstone sorceress in the waypoint ruins on the eastern edge of the west limgrave map the ruins are infested with deadly plant monsters including one that rains down holy lightning take out the small ones and once a path is clear dash down the stairs into the ruinshere youll face the mad pumpkin head boss though its a relatively straightforward fight the mad pumpkin has a threehit combo where he attacks with his flail then his fist then his flail again and it usually triggers when youre near him dash away to avoid

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/weird-west-review-occult-of-personality/1900-6417853/,the greatest compliment one can pay to weird west is that it does by and large capture the feeling of playing one of the pulpy ec comics and twofisted tales that inspired so many supernatural westerns in the past from its beautiful twocolor art style and creepy morality fables to its omnipresent leatherysounding narrator weird west is a fully realized grungy dimestore cowboy fantasy brought to vivid life the game you actually have to play to make progress in it isn as resounding a success howeverweird west wastes no time knocking you offkilter the second you hit the new game option you an unnamed hooded figure are strapped to a chair while other hooded figures brand your neck with an arcane symbol and shove you into the body of one jane bell a former bounty hunter who hung up her spurs for the quiet life on a farm unfortunately she forced to go full unforgiven after a gang called the stillwaters raids her farm kills her child and kidnaps her husband as it turns out theyve been raiding towns and villages across the country looking for fresh meat to feed to their new skinwalker leaders and its up to jane to put a stop to their reign of terror that by itself is the kind of plot you could build an entire game out of but weird west is even more like its ec comics forebears than it seems at first blush its an anthology so when jane story has come to a close we find ourselves back in a room with the hooded figures putting the brand on someone newa man whose memory and humanity are utterly mutilated out of him when his soul is brutally grafted with a pighuman hybrid body and a nearly unpronounceable name and when you done playing through that tale there are three more waiting for youyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing weird west video reviewthe weird west is a place with a memory however so someone you kill as jane bell is still a goner when the pig man shows up though there a nonzero chance you see them later as a zombie or a ghost with unfinished business if jane hasn yet captured a specific criminal when her story is over that criminal will continue to operate until youno matter whose body you inhabitfinally take the time to put them down choosing not to kill someone can have an impact as wellif you save someone life they may show up later during a shootout to save you in return on paper that level of cause and effect sounds incredible but weird west is a few rounds shy of a loaded revolver the games ability to remember grudges deaths and personal vendettas between characters is impressive and actually getting to know this gigantic cast of innocents bastards and weirdos is a joy however the morality system by which many of the games decisions are made is far too binary to live up to the game complexity elsewheremost of your choices come down to either the saintly right thing or such cartoonish mustachetwirling evil that at times it almost appalling that the option exists in one particular moment where you confront a woman who betrayed your character for the best possible reason the evil option is so abominable it deserves a trigger warning yes the correct choice is still there and handled well but the stories of our main characters are strong enough on their own they allow this group of marginalized folks to examine their roles in creating and surviving an increasingly colonized and haunted west and all the ways manifest destiny makes an already terrifying place even scariersome choices like whether to assist a recurring character who traveling the west in search of the keys to immortality actually say something worthwhile most however lack narrative nuance and come down to killing or sparing someone even in those cases death has a compelling ripple effect on the world a dead marauder siblings might be waiting for you outside a town wiping a town clean of one gang may leave it wide open to be occupied by their enemies next time you visit the storytelling as a whole is simplisticmostly go here talk to this person kill that person scenariosbut that not necessarily a bad thing on its own especially when the dialogue for these scenarios is so wellwritten it a wonderful mashup that sees grizzled brash wild west dialogue clash against eldritch cosmic horror prose and somehow those two styles complement one another rather well these are people willing to believe in the impossible and the impossible will often occur however with only a few exceptions that pay off in the later hours the narrative choices we given aren nearly intricate enough to be worthy of said storiesthe actual mechanics of the game are also a mess the camera is a huge problem right off the bat the freedom of motion works fine in outdoor areas but dungeons mines and other enclosed spaces are claustrophobically cramped and dense with detail and interactive items that wouldn be so much of a problem if there were an easy way to just point and click on items to investigate them or press a controller button that swings focus to the next interactive item but neither of those exists instead you rubbing on tables and shelves constantly hoping the indicator tells you that yes you can grab the one tiny box of ammo instead of the other seven or eight pieces of junk you can pick up in front of you there a lot to loot in this game and it far too easy to miss crucial items due to the sheer difficulty of singling out what you need in the crush of interactive items in the environment you can zoom the camera in and out a few levels but it never at the ideal place to see everything in the area and any enemies ahead of you without the nearest wall also partially blocking your visionthe games ability to remember grudges deaths and personal vendettas between characters is impressive and actually getting to know this gigantic cast of innocents bastards and weirdos is a joy however the morality system by which many of the games decisions are made is far too binary to live up to the games complexity elsewherethis all has a knockon effect on combat on controllers the game uses a twinstick shooter setup where the left stick moves you and the right stick aims your weapon a greatsounding system but because targets are smaller faster and hit like a ton of bricks it hard to maneuver the camera and sufficiently keep track of them the pc version doesn fix this either your character won shoot where you click but instead will just aim around to that general area the hitboxes on most enemies require surgical precision to score damage even with shotguns obviously it can be done but it hard to be that accurate on the fly which can frequently result in frustrating missesthere are stealthy options where as long as you remain unnoticed you can either do more damage with single hits set traps using environmental hazards or sneak up and put enemies to sleep but the sheer number of enemies in an area and how quick they are to notice and investigate the slightest of movementseven on normal difficultyoften makes this feel untenable for what its worth the basic weapon variety is nice you allowed to equip four types of firearmspistols shotguns rifles and bowsalong with a melee weapon and explosives and none are restricted to a single character so it very easy to find your goto weapon type and stick with it throughout the game borderlands this isn thoughaside from how far andor fast they fire every pistol feels the same every shotgun feels the same and that applies to all the other types too there a special type of explosive that drops cluster bombs instead of doing just one explosion but they prohibitively rare and expensive that sameness isn an issue on its own but while weapons aren scarce they also don scale you can find a rifle that does damage on any random goon in the game with pieces of silver you can upgrade that into a rifle that does maybe damage want one that does or damage you might find that difficult despite the fact that many of the towns you travel to ingame have multiple shops which will sell you weapons the only ones that raise your stats to any significant degree are also expensive generally twostar weapons are the best you find out in the world although there are threestar weapons in the game they either super expensive the most expensive rifle in the game is and doesn even have better damage than an upgraded twostar or rare money isn necessarily hard to come by but the economy is heavily skewed towards bounties above anything else you can do for money and unless your stealth skills are absolutely incredible so much of your earnings end up going towards ammo and health items to replace what you lost chasing your targets that fattening your wallet can feel like an uphill strugglethere is a separate upgrade system that grants your guns some new special abilities to learn that make things easier you have a max payneish bullettime dive in your arsenal when you start but all the weapons also have special abilities you can unlock which can do everything from make your next rifle shot a silent headshot to a rampage mode that makes it so shotguns don need reloading for a few seconds to the ability to shoot electric or explosive bulletsnone of these are necessarily gamechangers the way they should be though part of that is the controls where activating your weapon ability involves holdingtoggling the aim button holding the ability wheel button and hoping you remember what button activates which ability that not the worst control scheme on its own but combined with how fiddly the targeting system is using your abilities involves clumsily fumbling around every single surface of the controller and so even relatively casual side quests can find you getting into frantic interminable shootouts low on ammo and doing chip damage the saving grace is an overzealous quicksaveautosave system that means failure doesn put you back too far and enough side quests and bounties are available so that earning enough cash for resources isn terribly difficult but it typically only enough money to maintain not advance and the anthology nature of the game means putting hours of work into one upgrade that you only get to use relatively briefly bewildering moments still occur too after killing one particular boss you tasked with destroying his haunted mansion by placing explosives on the building foundation unfortunately having used all my explosives to kill a horde of zombies a few minutes earlier i was out and there were none to be found in the immediate area this meant leaving the area riding all the way across the country to the nearest town with an ammo shop and buying a stick of dynamite just so i could finish weird west does feel like the logical creative conclusion to something like fallout leaning more and more into its western tropes but the ultimate irony is how much this game plays like the original fallout from the struggle worth it though rather emphatically the answer is still yes the writing the story the characters and the ways in which your actions have an effect on the world are all enthralling i wanted answers to the mysteries presented since the heroes and villains of these tales are captivating and the payoffs by and large are worthwhile there are a lot of excellent oldschool isometric adventure games in weird west dna but not enough newschool polish for it to be something great,Weird West Review - Occult Of Personality,en,828.0,Positive

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-review-duel-of-the-bricks/1900-6417859/,it surreal to think that the first lego star wars is inching closer to two decades old but even more so to see a brandnew version of some of those same stories in lego star wars the skywalker saga time has allowed for significant reinventiondeveloper traveller tales latest marks the biggest departure from the familiar formula that has permeated its library of lego games these gameplay changes enhance the familiar lego actionadventure gameplay to make the momenttomoment combat platforming and puzzlesolving more engaging however the breadth of content on offer does not live up to the potential of this new directioncore to the skywalker saga gameplay changes is a new perspective gone is the overhead camera replaced by an overtheshoulder thirdperson view that draws you closer into effectsladen lightsaber duels and chaotic cantina shootouts you offered far more control over the action than in earlier lego titles with coverbased shooting giving you more tactical options to take out stormtroopers and expanded combos offering more options to dismantle droids with a flurry of melee strikes the skywalker saga difficulty is still tuned to ensure you always making progressits action is straightforward and breezy while its puzzles are usually just a handful of steps away from a solutionrather than throwing difficult roadblocks in your way it lets youeasily progress even if you just repeatedly mashing a single attack it still fun to experiment with new button combinations to see special moves from the game expansive roster of characters but this isn a game that requires you to memorize extended combo stringsthese mechanics are

to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing lego star wars the skywalker saga video reviewwith more than playable star wars characters there a lot of space for many of these to be complete copies of one another and while there is significant overlap between the characters that wield the same category of weapon a class system creates enough of a substantial gameplay difference between similar characters it easy to tell the difference between a fastshooting bounty hunter and a wellrounded scoundrel as well as the slight ability differences between forcewielding characters depending on whether they jedi or sith each class also features unique abilities that are needed for certain puzzles supplying incentive to swap between characters when you exploring planet hubs or replaying story stagesreplacing the collectible red bricks from previous games are new kyber bricks which are used in conjunction with the returning stud currency to upgrade the skywalker saga expanded roster of character types each class has its own albeit small upgrade tree to pursue letting you expand on the abilities of forcewielding melee fighters or the utility of a protocol droid this can make objects thrown with the force more deadly for example or make equipped armor block more damage most of these unfortunately only work toward removing the annoyance of minigames that wear out their welcome early in the game instead of giving you more fun tools to layer on top of the expanded combat options given the game low difficulty it also easy to just completely ignore many of the core upgrades that apply to all character types considering they do not have any tangible effects on the way you will continue playing this makes hunting for kyber bricks less exciting unless you crave the missing thrill of finally uncovering the last one after breaking apart everything in a levelthroughout the levels of the skywalker saga five levels per movie you be swapping between predetermined character teams to tackle some of the skywalker saga best moments especially in its linear stages the mix of puzzlesolving and effectsladen action is a delight letting you reexperience some of the highest highs of the franchise with a humorous veneer it clear from the moments included such as the climactic lightsaber duels and recognizable death star trench run and by extension those relegated to slight mentions in cutscenes like anything that has to do with trade routes that traveller tales understands star wars fans both young and old the skywalker saga has enough silly slapstick moments to garner countless giggles from younger players but is also full of clever jokes from other sources that older players will appreciate a reference to an eddie izzard skit was a real highlightsome of the most climactic moments from the films are played for intricate laughs sometimes even poking fun at them in the process a younger anakin in episode i is written as a laughably selfcentered brat quickly moving from one emotional trauma to the next if it continues his journey to become a jedi later in the same campaign the eyecatching fight between darth maul and the jedi pairing of obiwan and quigon jinn supplies another good reason to lose yourself in the epic soundscape of duel of the fates which is made all the more special if you happen to notice the hovering platforms of a droid orchestra playing along to the symphony in the background the skywalker saga and its design seem acutely aware of what moments still play well with fans today and it makes exploring the trilogies again a delightit outside of the more tightly directed levels that the skywalker saga falters each campaign takes you to a variety of small but open hubs littered with many side quests and optional puzzles for you to solve while initially engagingi spent a lot of time messing around on tatooine during my first handful of hoursthe content in these hubs quickly becomes repetitive puzzle and quest structures are recycled to supply some challenge in obtaining many of the game unlockable items from new characters and ships to individual pieces for microbuilds there are only so many times that looking for a character in an area filled with almost identically styled ones is fun though which enticed me to rush through these hubs during campaigns to get back to the good stuffattempting to stick with the campaign core content also shows how empty some objectives can be especially when these same hubs are used to bridge the slower moments in the films there are a handful of times when you travel to a planet and are forced to walk slowly behind a character until you reach a waypoint get treated to a short cutscene and are then directed back offworld to progress the story there a whole section in episode i where you looking for the gungans after they fled their underwater city but you must walk from the entrance to the farthest point of the hub just to get the prompt to leave the level and search elsewhere it clear that the side content is meant to entice you to poke around these hubs more but once that allure has worn off the way it breaks up the pacing throughout each campaign is frustratingwhat does make the backandforth journeys somewhat more enjoyable is the additional time you get to spend admiring the incredible detail that has gone into each one of these hubs mixing the blocky aesthetic of lego with some realistic backdrops the skywalker saga is surprisingly breathtaking to admire the lighting in particular is drastically improved over previous entries providing a sheen to the clean minifig characters that can be visibly dulled over time and under the right conditions whether in the blinding white snowstorms of hoth or the dusty streets of mos espa the heavy rain on kamino makes lightsaber swings glisten across the waterslicked surfaces setting a new high bar for what you can expect from future lego games of this ilkmuch like the way early lego star wars games set a tone for where the franchise would explore next and how it would do so the skywalker saga feels like the epitome of all the lessons learnt along the way while also setting up for the future the intimate new camera angle and expanded combat breathe life into a familiar formula while the linear levels feature a pleasing mix of puzzles and combat that are peppered with sharp humor it a pity that all of this can be leveraged well enough to inject the same excitement into the side content that makes up most of the explorable hubs which can take the thrill out of hunting down every unlockable character but when the skywalker saga finds its stride and it often does it can be one of the most enjoyable ways to rediscover this storied franchise

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/chinatown-detective-agency-review-carmen-singapore/1900-6417856/,i love games where i get to play detective finding thematic or narrative connections in seemingly unrelated item descriptions or the testimonies of npcs chinatown detective agency doesn quite manage to fulfill that fantasysurprising given its titlebut it still delivers an engrossing experience with investigations that require realworld sleuthing i remain a bit bewildered about the implied importance of a few of the game mechanics but its cases are thrilling for how each tests you on your research skills and problemsolvingchinatown detective agency sees you step into the gumshoes of amira darma a former interpol agent striving to break free from the bureaucratic nonsense and go freelance as a private investigator the game takes place in years after a global economic collapse automated drones have displaced most of the jobs for the low and middle class and corporations have commodified previously governmentcontrolled services what could possibly be morally wrong about a country water being sold to citizens via a tiered subscription service with each subsequent level improving upon the qualityit a bleak worldview of a broken futurea world that thematically and narratively juxtaposed against the brightly pixelated neon of singapore one of the few countries in the game that hasn completely gone to shit and where amira sets up the titular agency though your investigations will take you to other countries across the globe singapore is where most of chinatown detective agency takes placegiven singapore multicultural population it a compelling setting for a cybernoir adventure game the country is a melting pot of ideologies and technologies that reflects its prominence in the realworld history of southeast asia as well as being colonized by the british empire in the and occupied by japan during world war ii everyone you meet may speak english but excellent vocal performances especially from singaporean native leonie koh who voices amira depict a variety of accents and further convey that this is a place where many different types of stories convergesingapore place in history and ongoing role as a hotbed of international intermingling informs the cases you receive creating a believable background for dozens of compelling missions that range from investigating a group of international art thieves who are righting the wrongs of several centuries worth of colonization to pursuing a mysterious killer who has managed to turn everyday drones into deadly bombs there isn one type of case to take and how you need to solve them will change as regularly as whatever goal you trying to reacha rewarding variety that encapsulates how amira may need to adjust her behavior to account for working with so many different people that have issues stemming back to their unique culturesall of that is setdressing to the pointandclick gameplay which tasks you with successfully running your own detective business in order to keep the lights on you need to earn a steady paycheck if your bank account hits zero or you miss two months of rent in a row it game overbudgeting would be a clever consideration if it weren for amira starting out with a fairly decent bank account and then securing a clientele that isn afraid to drop huge payouts on a job well done not once in my playthrough did i ever run the risk of going broke and even after i paid for an office expansion i still had plenty left over for the higher rent and salary for the subordinate i hiredas such the game monetary system does create a bit of dissonance in amira characterization who throughout is written to be someone who always hustling to take on more work in order so she can make ends meet in terms of gameplay the system also feels superfluous since money is no concern sitting down at your office computer and paying rent is just taking time away from the far more enjoyable aspect of chinatown detective agency the sleuthingin terms of collecting evidence and knowing where to go next amira has you covered you don have to figure out what clues are importantamira will automatically know what worth paying attention to nor do you have to figure out what the next step in a case isamira will know where to bring her findings to before she even has them instead your sleuthing skills are put to the test in terms of factchecking researching and codebreakingearly in chinatown detective agency amira is drawn into three lines of work aiding a fixer who works for the city shadowy elite a socialite who supports an heir trying to dispose of his vast fortune and a politician who is determined to clean out the rising corruption in singapore government after getting to know each client you have to pick one that you work with fulltime doing so cuts off the other two storylines affecting who amira can ultimately meet and befriend what enemies she makes and how the final act of the game plays outeach client story is interesting and dives into a different kind of investigation creating a compelling reason to play through chinatown detective agency at least three times for example rupert the fixer asks you to do a lot of undercover work which requires you to solve riddles and meet informants at specific places at certain timesworking with him will appeal to folks who enjoy puzzlesolving and codebreaking under pressure as a counterexample tiger lily cases will usually put a greater emphasis on your observational and research skills prioritizing your ability to figure out the country of origin for artifacts from around the worlddeveloper general interactive co has been outspoken concerning its inspirations oftentimes citing educational mystery series carmen sandiego when describing chinatown detective agency gameplay it an apt comparisonthe solution to every case you hired for regardless of client in chinatown detective agency is based upon an understanding of realworld history religion mathematics language architecture philosophy art or literature for example when asked by tiger lily to deliver a collection of stamps to their country of origin i had to parse the pixelated rendition of a building on the stamp to deduce where it came fromunless you happen to be an especially knowledgeable individual with a deep understanding of the various cultures found in countries across the globe you need to seek outside sources in order to figure out next steps a helpful button is always present on the screen that suspends the game and opens up an online search engine at least on pc where i playedi don know how the xbox and switch versions handle that yet though i preferred having my smartphone handy insteadhaving a notebook on hand isn a bad idea either this is not a game where you trying to figure out the answer from several choices chinatown detective agency will regularly require you to enter the answer to a question into a text chat meaning you can confidently guess the system is somewhat generousyour answers will be deemed wrong for incorrect spelling but punctuation and grammar doesn seem to be a factor you have to know what the answer is and sometimes that answer can be long and difficult to parselike breaking down a full page worth of seemingly random letters by using the mathematical concept of fibonacci numbers thatthat one took a while to figure outone of my favorite cases saw me going undercover and needing to gain a person trust after learning of his favorite bar i scanned his past receipts and discovered he was a fan of red wine from burgundy amira figured a bottle of the stuff was the best way to get the man to open up but since she doesn know a thing about wine and frankly neither do i when she arrived at the store i grabbed my phone and took a quick history lesson on wine brands and their region of origin in order to figure out what considered a highquality red wine from burgundy i then had amira peruse the store to see if they had any of the wines i managed to discover they did not so back to google i went until i figured it out when amira finally showed up to the meeting with the gift in hand her mark praise for her exquisite taste made me feel genuinely smartit wasn the game telling me what to do i was figuring out solutions based on the limited details providedit satisfying to figure out a problem via observation and logic which removes the human element of detective work but at least matches the deductive reasoning and critical thinking aspects of the job as previously mentioned amira walks you through the case and how everything fits together so there never a eureka moment but the act of researching the clues to understand what they are and then being validated contributes to a sense of rewarding success and knowing that you progress and get more of the intriguing story when you figure things out is an excellent bonusif you happen to run into a difficult wall chinatown detective agency has an incredibly clever help button early into amira first case she meets one of the world last human librarians mei who takes a liking to the pi work you can call mei whenever you like and for a small fee get her to lend her massive literary expertise and offer you a hint on what you should be searching for in order to move forward pay a bit more and mei will do some research coming back with the answer in hand and allowing you to proceed mei services aren that expensive so turning to her a handful of times over the course of the campaign won break the bank but you may need to start actually worrying about making ends meet if you rely on her for every step of every casemei is a great hint system as it easy enough to ignore her if you don want the help while also ensuring you can keep playing if one or two problems ultimately stump you plus she naturally integrates into the narrative of the gamelike of course a detective would have someone on tap to turn to when stumped on a caseyou encounter a few other mechanics across your playthrough that don relate back to sleuthing and each feels tackedon as a resultsimilar to the money management system on occasion amira will be tasked with completing a small minigame to hack through a door or quickly pinpoint the spot on a person she wants to shoot to avoid taking the kill shot neither system adds anything thrilling to chinatown detective agency gameplay though their simplicity does provide a break for your brainchinatown detective agency does try to pigeonhole a bit of mystery into its campaign in background events that ultimately culminate in one final case that defines most of the third act giving you a chance to figure out how events may all connect prior to amira discovering it for herself it not a very compelling conclusion to what otherwise a strong story veering from believable science fiction into implausible science fantasy the goals of the final villain are delivered in long textheavy exposition as well and though it seems like the game wishes you to view them as a tragic figure there not enough nuance to warrant any real analysis of their motivationsseveral annoying bugs also dampened the experience most notably i encountered audio problems in my playthrough near the end of the campaign one of the cases that i took on required me to decode an audio message but nothing played when i listened to the recording after uninstalling and reinstalling the game the audio recording reappeared additionally the voice acting returned in the scene following that case after being absent from the latter half of the second act and most of the third until then i had figured that chinatown detective agency simply didn have voice acting once the game diverged into its three different campaigns you may not be as unlucky as i was but the audio bug was a major disappointment given how much the voice acting adds to characterization of the caston top of audio issues my game froze twiceone of which happened right at the end of a case forcing me to close the game without saving and replay the entire thing again additionally the game subtitles regularly do not match up with the voice acting for the most part it fineamira may say something one way while the text details the same sentence but with slightly different phrasing it can occasionally still result in confusion though given that certain words and phrases can mean the same thing but have different conversational connotationsthe one solid throughline for chinatown detective agency is amira herself she brings an impressively collected disposition and nononsense personality to every one of her cases and tackles every situation with the suaveness of a seasoned noir detective i never going to stand here and tell you all that she super coolat the end of the day she still a cop and tackles her workload with the blackandwhite mentality of one for most of the game throughout the first and second acts if someone is doing something illegal she does what it takes to stop them even if she stopping actions that are perhaps morally rightfor example she steps in to take down a group of thieves who are only stealing art to return them to the countries they been stolen from amira may be in the legal right in that situation but it still a bit unsettling that she so okay with taking down the group even once she learns of their altruistic goals simply because it against the law eventually amira does come around to a less rigid moral code as she drawn further into the worlds of gray of each of her three clients which slowly transforms how she behaveseven committing actions that she normally condemn in order to solve a case and help people like stealing evidence breakingandentering and shooting suspects before even attempting to peacefully talk them downit admittedly a bit too strong a swing in the other direction coming just short of glorifying a resultsoriented approach to policing that would have also been a big nonowe don need more stories that make the argument that police should be allowed to do whatever they want as long as the bad guys are punished given how the world is not blackandwhite to the point where every action can be easily defined as good or evil and this game regularly reminds you of that both in its campaign and the realworld history you have to peruse in order to beat it so even though it does skate that line chinatown detective agency ultimately tells a story that more about a woman learning that the law isn geared towards helping the downtrodden and so should be bent sometimes as opposed to a tale about a cop learning the benefits of being able to break the law and remain untouchable by most of societychinatown detective agency goes down as one of my favorite detective games ever you may not be actually doing any detective work and solving mysteriesyou not asked to figure out what a clue what it means and how it may connect to other clues but even so chinatown detective agency successfully emulates the deductive reasoning necessary to be an investigator by simply tasking you with figuring out how to interpret a confusing clue a collection of bugs and superfluous systems drag down the experience a bit but the singaporean setting makes for a thrilling setup for some realworld sleuthing and excellent voice acting and a compelling protagonist sell the dystopian but somewhat tragically beautiful cybernoir

play through it again and againsee our dead cells reviewone of the best and most inventive modern roleplaying games disco elysium performs pretty well on nintendo switch though there is slowdownparticularly in docked modeand load times are lengthy the positives outweigh the intermittent performance issues disco elysium is an absolutely brilliant detective game that gameplay revolves around talking rather than action but it far more riveting than most actionpacked rpgs thanks to its exquisite and arguably unparalleled writing as well as its beautiful and mysterious world filled with all sorts of interesting characters and activities disco elysium gives the player an incredible amount of freedom and this allows the adventure to feel different each time you replay it disco elysium is essentially the grandest pointandclick adventure ever made if you remotely care about narrative in games disco elysium is a mustplay experiencesee our disco elysium the final cut reviewit something of a miracle that divinity original sin plays so well on nintendo switch while the resolution is worse than on other platforms particularly in handheld mode original sin runs well the

pixpil and published by chuckefish the topdown adventure stars a duo of adventurerssam and johnwho are exiled from their subterranean mining world and forced to explore the outside world as an actionadventure game with dungeons puzzles and a whole stable of interesting enemies and bosses it easy to draw comparisons to classic the legend of zelda games eastward is also marked by great writing and a really unique world that a joy to explore it also has a wild array of weapons including a frying pan and flamethrower while eastward suffers a bit from uneven pacing across its lengthy hour adventure it a highly rewarding experience that worth sticking out until the endrelentlessly engaging and rife with variety fire emblem three houses is the most impressive entry in the beloved strategy series you play as a professor who oversees one of three houses at a mysterious monastery there you cultivate relationships and train your students to be prepared for the battles ahead while

balance between storytelling preparation for the next battle and the alwayswonderful tactical combat scenarios the series is known for with deftly written characters an exceedingly good tale and smart tweaks to the layered combat system fire emblem three houses is an astonishing experience from start to finish and more than any other fire emblem game before it three houses encourages multiple

first stop is a local country club where he tries to sign up for lessons from there golf story becomes a zany and peculiar little game filled with the unexpected while it does feature traditional topdown golf with a threeclick swing system many of the activities you complete are more chaotic in nature and often not grounded in any semblance of reality the writing is hilarious and the offthewall characters add color to what is ostensibly a fairly sad tale about one man midlife crisis golf story is the most game boyesque game on switch and its endearing visuals and wacky objectives make it one of the best and most unique exclusives on the platformsee our golf story reviewthough escaping the underworld is the goal in hades being sent back to it after each failed run isn a bad consolation prize hades more than any other roguelike before it intertwines its fastpaced action gameplay with its exquisite story in such a way that failure can be a good thing you play as hades son zagreus a charismatic hero in his own right but it the supporting cast and all of their own interpersonal tales that make hades such an enriching experience each attempt to escape the underworld is a

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-the-best-kirby-yet/1900-6417850/,we don talk nearly enough about the fact that kirby on a conceptual level is terrifying yes the smooth wad of pink bubble gum is adorableno one is debating that he smiles incessantly while waving his little arms and waddling on his disproportionate feet and he always there to say hiiiiii in a cheerful manner but kirby is also an abomination a frankensteinesque experiment created in a lab run by a mad scientist named hal he gleefully inhales other creatures swallows them and absorbs their powers i call him thanos but he doesn have the proper anatomy to wear a worldshattering gauntlet yet sadly i have to report that we allowed kirby to get too full of himself and others and he reached his ultimate form in kirby and the forgotten land the culmination of years of exploring the malleable mascot kirby and the forgotten land is the most inventive and best entry in franchise history the move to brings kirby signature mechanic to life in a way that wasn possible before this feels like a new beginning for kirby as it maintains all of the familiar series trappings while presenting them in a cohesive wellrounded adventure that is playfully imaginative throughoutkirby and the forgotten land follows the traditional stagebased format with multiple areas and rooms in each areait certainly not as open as the trailers have made it seem it much closer to super mario world than super mario odyssey still the stages hold far more secrets than might initially meet the eye actively encouraging you to poke around to find hidden rooms paths and areas with selfcontained objectives containing their own rewards at the endyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing kirby and the forgotten land video reviewthough forgotten land mostly sticks with the triedandtrue world themes we come to expect from nintendo platformersgrass sea ice fire desert etcthe remnants of civilization present in the forgotten land give these locales mysterious vibes that make them unique from an abandoned shopping mall and amusement park to a haunted house and chilly metro station each of forgotten land stages tell their own story unlike some other recent kirby games it almost always feels fresh and full of new ideasthis consistent novel charm is significantly bolstered by the meaningful use of kirby copy mechanic and the brandnew mouthful mode yes the latter certainly contributes to kirby being a cute and cuddly version of frankenstein monster but mouthful mode isn a silly gimmick it a delightful and interesting gameplay mechanic that also happens to be quite funny kirby can only absorb powers of living things he not a monster so when he tries to inhale inanimate objects he just stretches his body around them claiming them like my oneyearold son lays claim to every item in the house watching him swallow other characters and take on their attributes was a lot to deal with already but now we have to embrace the chaos that is kirby inhaling cars commandeering roller coasters and revolutionizing the aerodynamics of paraglidingeach mouthful ability has its own unique mechanic and is often used to complete bonus objectives and rescue hidden waddle dees the abilities up the gameplay in creative ways coaster mouth sees kirby do his best ratchet railgrind impression arch mouth introduces flying sequences and ring mouth can knock enemies out with powerful gusts or be used to steer a boat my two favorite mouthful abilities were water balloon mouth and lightbulb mouth water balloon mouth turns kirby into a giant blob who spews water clearing fiery obstacles and sludge while laying waste to colossal obstacles that cannot be taken out with normal copy abilities meanwhile the sparsely used lightbulb mouth assists with pitchblack environments such as the aforementioned haunted house where cardboard monsters pop out from the walls and ghosts chase the illuminated kirby bulbwhile mouthful mode is certainly a standout feature that creates some interesting and fresh scenarios i was even more impressed with how kirby copy abilities were utilized these transformations have always been cool but they rarely felt meaningful from a strategic or level design standpoint abilities typically blended together which made your transformation choices feel inconsequential kirby planet robobot laid the groundwork for making copy abilities more important but forgotten land takes this idea and runs with it there are far more specialized puzzles that require a particular ability than ever before such as switches that have to be hit in quick succession with the cutter by performing a combo move ice blocks that require fire to melt fiery crates that need the cooling power of ice floating targets for ranged weapons and nails for the hammer among others even some of the platforming sequences are designed with specific abilities in mind including large gaps that can only be crossed with the tornado ability or surfaces that call for kirby to glide like a figure skater with the ice ability the perspective itself is also a boon to kirby abilities as it makes them versatile and leads to morecreative puzzles experimentation and openended objectivesalong with platforming and puzzle solving the copy mechanic is more important to combat than in previous entries kirby and the forgotten probably won be a difficult game for those with some experience playing actionplatformers but it is the most challenging kirby to date when played on the wild difficulty setting some bosses can kill you in a handful of hits especially if you settle on one favorite copy ability all bosses have different attack patterns from the brute force closerange strength of the giant gorilla to the agile grace of a crafty leopard and i was surprised to find that in lategame boss fights i needed to actually have a strategy when it came to using copy abilities for those looking for a lighter experience spring breeze is a great difficulty option while the boss fights are welldesigned the minibosses who pop up numerous times each grow stale it the only aspect of the mainline missions that relies on repetition which is a shame because it would been nice to see a greater variety to match the expanding arsenal of abilities at your disposalblueprints earned by defeating bosses exploring the levels and solving hidden puzzles can be used to evolve copy abilities i was concerned at first that the evolved forms would make forgotten land ridiculously easy but the adventure does a great job at gradually ramping up the difficulty alongside your expected ability upgrades evolved copy abilities deal greater damage while having additional features the rangerwhich goes pewpeweventually evolves into the space ranger which even gives kirby a spacesuit my favorite was dragon fire which not only gives kirby purplish firebreathing powers but a pair of wings for a glide attack as copy abilities evolve so do their potential use cases i actually thought about my offensive approach in a kirby game which is something i never thought i be able to sayyou also need rare stones to upgrade copy abilities and those are found in optional side stages on treasure road there are actually more treasure road stages than main levels so it be reasonable to think these might be filler content nope these time trials make expert use of the revamped copy abilities and new mouthful mode each stage is themed around a specific ability and i had a blast with every one of them shooting moving targets zipping through obstacle courses skating across slippery paths flipping switches in quick successiontreasure road stages are fastpaced side dishes that offer mouthfuls of fun some of them can be quite tricky especially if you aiming for the record time which rewards you with bonus coins and oftentimes demands near perfectionthe weapons shop where you purchase upgrades is just one of the buildings and businesses that pop up from being a diligent explorer as you rescue waddle dees from the nefarious beast pack they get to work on expanding waddle dee townthe game central hub multiple item shops open throughout your adventure allowing you to purchase food to restore health on the go or items that increase attackspeedhealth for a limited timefor those who are having a hard time with a boss a health reserve or attack boost can definitely help when my daughter was struggling with one of the bosses i purchased five attack boosts you can stack them and the increased damage she dealt from lobbing bombs did the trick since kirby games are ultimately geared towards kids it nice to see those types of helpful tricks while still being able to provide a less tame experience for those who love kirby games but find that their simplicity has gone too far in some cases and those purchasable items are quite useful for the unlockable coliseum boss rush mode that is purely focused on speed outside of the coliseum waddle dee town has a few minigames including the motionsensored tiltandroll that nods back to the game boy color game tilttumble and reflexbased fishing and cooking games you can also spend coins at the gotcha machine to try and collect all of the figures beware there are a lot of figures and all they do is sit in a digital album the activities in waddle dee town aren that engaging but they are essentially cute little addons rather than focal pointsit worth noting that i didn rescue every waddle dee but it doesn appear that you have to in order to complete waddle dee town each stage has waddle dees you earn for completing the level hidden waddle dees and three to four secret objectives that save additional waddle dee if you want to be a completionist the game helps you out by revealing a secret objective you missed each time you complete a level my only gripe here is that some of the secret objectives largely for boss levels are tied to using a specific copy ability this makes it impossible for even the most thorough of players to find everything in one run and if the reward for saving every waddle dee is similar to that of breath of the wild korok seed hunt or mario odyssey moons then i sorry waddle dees some of y aren coming home i spent around hours with forgotten landmostly just completing the mainline and treasure road missionsand am currently at completionfor parents with young kids the local coop mode is a blast even though one player has to be the decidedly less cool bandana waddle dee while he the coolest waddle dee due to the bandana i do wish that there was a colony of different color kirbies like there are yoshis the copy and mouthful abilities being limited to kirby means that one player doesn get to partake in the most interesting aspects of each stage this is particularly noticeable during mouthful sections as bandana waddle dee has to rely on kirby to do his thing to move onto the next section it a better coop mode than some other familyfriendly switch exclusives super mario odyssey bowser fury but the experience playing as a waddle dee isn nearly as dynamic when you stuck with one set of attacks while kirby has dozenskirby and the forgotten land is one of those games that hard to play without constantly having a silly smile on your face it far more than just a cute and charming platformer with colorful visuals though this is one of the best platformers on nintendo switch thanks to its brilliantly designed stages and a dynamic arsenal of abilities that consistently shake up the

beginning of the weekend a relief from the stress of the week but just before the weekend of april began the cw finally gave the official notice that dc legends of tomorrow was being canceled after seven seasons it a painful cancellation for its devoted fanbase possibly fueled by an impending network sale that leaves us on a heck of a cliffhanger it feels like a good friend has left usit was the third or fourth show to join the arrowverse depending on whether you consider supergirl cbs season as being a part of it legends of tomorrow shouldn have worked it all started with a terrible pitch what if we took a bunch of side characters from different shows and made them time travelersand for the first season that was kind of true like many other shows with devoted fanbasesstar trek the next generation and parks and recreation come to mindit took the show a while to find its footing the first season was overly dramatic centering on the show leastlikeable charactersrip hunter hawkman hawkgirl and vandal savageand on characters bad decisions unnecessary secrets and worst of all a love trianglea few episodes into legends second season though the adults left the room and then didn bother to check on the weird kids for six seasonsthings immediately strayed into the bizarre with reverseflasheobard thawne migrating from the flash with his other faceplayed by matt letscher instead of tom cavanaghto antagonize the legends he was later joined by arrow villains damien darhk neal mcdonough and malcolm merlyn john barrowman to form the legion of doom throughout the season the legends would fight confederate soldiers meet jonah hex take part in the first fullsize arrowverse crossover and meet all manner of historical figures from al capone to george washington ray goes to the moon with thawne forcing them to work together to get home the villains win and rewrite reality temporarily creating the first of many alternate timelines the show would explorethis second season felt gleefully unburdened compared to the first it made great use of previous villains for one this is something both marvel and dc shows struggle with villains tend to be a big bad for a season they killed and then they gone for good they rarely given the opportunity to resurface the way villains do in the comic book source material damien darhk for example was a badlywritten arrow villain that brought stakes that were much too high for the show about the man who shows colorful pointy sticks and his girlfriend who hacks things with her ipad against a team of time travelers that include an atomic man an atomsized man and someone who can summon any animal they want though he a much better fit darhk would go on to recur throughout the show first as a villain and then as a begrudging antihero redeemed by his daughter and the legends relentless optimism he developed into a sympathetic character that was the perfect definition of a recurring villain and was given room to change and grow throughout he one of my alltime favorite characters in the arrowverse despite his rough patch on arrow and it all thanks to legendsthe show also became absolutely unafraid to be silly and in active conversation with its fanbase when a stuffed animal named beebo inadvertently became an oracle to a band of vikings the fandom latched onto him making him a hilarious recurring character the season finale had the legends transforming voltronstyle into a giant beebo and then showing its shaolin style to a time demonlegends also got metatextualmaking fun of itself and of televisionin a way that calls to mind something like nbc community for example that time demon mallus is voiced by character actor john noble in the episode guest starring john noble they kidnapped john noble from the lord of the rings set where he played denethor so that they could have him pretend to be mallus to try to manipulate an evil character into doing you know less evil so they had the actor who plays the part of the villain play himself playing the part of the villainlater the show would goof around with parodies and do great sendups of tv genres and other tropes sara lance once told a character that the crew wasn allowed to talk about macguffins before she had her coffee macguffin is the term used in storytelling critique to talk about the item everyone is afterthe holy grail the allspark etcbut which isn actually the point of the story they parody star trek friends and more but it was always always with the intention of telling us something about the charactersthese characters were not static and even throwaway jokes became central to the characters zari during a timeloop episode learned that hardened thief mick rory had a secret knack for writing romance novels and that would later become an important part of his character rather than a silly joke that made fun of someone having feelings and expressing them throughout his six seasons with the show rory evolved from a hardened criminal to a loving if very surly father and someone proud to be part of the legends teamit tough to write stuff like this that winks at the audience but doesn do so at the expense of the characters and legends deftly balanced this throughout its runsomething that would be a problem for other shows became a strong point for legends a huge revolving cast the first season saw the exit of three of the waverider characters and that began a tradition that would last through the show run each season would see some characters leave the show and others join that meant that the core crew from season dwindled until only sara lance was left but it also brought great characters like john constantine aboard the team timeshipactress maisie richardsonsellers joined the show as amaya jiwe and later shifted to the role of charlie a shapechanger who became stuck in the form of jiwe and eventually came to like it matt ryan joined as john constantine but would later play gwyn davies tala ashe played two wildly different versions of her character zari one a flannelwearing donutloving hacker and another from an alternate timeline where she was a kardashianlike fashionfirst media mogul the show took care of its actors like that giving them both reasons to stay on the show if they wanted and to flex their acting chops by playing different characters and sporting different lookseven characters that felt so random and weird at first became beloved members of the group such as when a change to the timeline replaced zari with her brother the lovable stoner behrad the missteps here were few and far between with even initially obnoxious characters like gary greene finding a way to fit into the show and grow into a full personthroughout its run the legends would contend with historical time anomalies resurrected souls from hell aliens and mythological creatures making sure that things never felt like a villainoftheweek treadmill despite the show being of a similar budget if not smaller budget as compared to other arrowverse shows legends were constantly ending up in new locations and time periods the set designers and directors never made these feel cheap despite how cheap they probably were in reality the show wasn overly concerned with realism but instead understood the fine line between capturing the essence of something and slavishly recreating every detaillegends was so silly and true to itself throughout its run that it made the other arrowverse shows look worse by comparison it was unafraid to transform itself and take chances to give its cast and characters the room they needed to flourish it felt the series was playing a prank on the network and all of the other shows as devastating as it is that the show was canceled it hard not to be grateful that we got seven seasons of this utter nonsensei wish we gotten to meet booster gold for more than the last half of the season finale donald faison would fit in with the legends crew swimmingly we would been able to say goodbye to sara lance and the waveriderlegends of tomorrow shouldn have worked but the writers and cast loved the show so much that they willed it to work they molded and chiseled away at it until the worst parts fell away to reveal even more silliness and personality there are still arrowverse shows on the cw the flash will get a season superman and lois a season but as the cw prepares to sell itself off to the highest bidder it looked to shave off shows that weren quite so successful legends slid under the radar for so long and it feels like someone finally checked the books and realized that somehow this show was still being filmed and aired by the networkas legends of tomorrow dies it hard not to see it as the beginning of the end of the arrowvers and that doesn even account for the fact that it was cancelled on the same day as batwoman effectively ending both of the network lgbtqled superhero shows at once both legends and the arrowverse were weird ambitious experiments that despite flaws worked better than they should for those of us that found legends of tomorrow it was a true gift of a show a gem in the cw crown and one of the few superhero shows that stood out as offering something different from the overdramatic apocalyptic tone of so many other superhero shows and moviesimage credit the cw network llc all rights reservedgot a news tip or want to

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wwe-2k22-review-bad-times-dont-last/1900-6417846/,after the unmitigated disaster that was wwe publisher games took the bold decision to give developer visual concepts an extra year to work on the next game in the series annual sports games are very rarely if ever given a year off but wwe is proof of the benefits that can occur when development isn confined to a tight yearly turnaround it a massive step up from improving on nearly every aspect of the longrunning series the inring action has been reworked and improved the variety and quality of its game modes has increased and there been a major decrease in the amount of unrelenting glitches afflicting each and every facet of the game some legacy issues persist and not all of the new additions are successful but wwe still represents a recent high mark for the seriesthis all begins once you step inside the ropes of the squared circle for the first time wwe superstar drew gulak is onhand to guide you through all of the new changes and his humorous and informative tutorial proves invaluable whether you a newcomer or a series veteran this is mainly because wwe takes inspiration from traditional fighting games by placing a significant emphasis on combos striking has been completely overhauled to fit this new mold with light heavy and grapple attacks now filling out your offensive arsenal you can execute light or heavy combos by mashing each attack respective button or combine all three attack types to diversify your offense and keep your opponent guessing ending a combo with a grapple attack will see your character transition into a powerful wrestling move like a suplex or ddt while ending with a heavy combo often launches into a canned animation that encompasses multiple hardhitting strikes in successiongrappling has also been reworked requiring you to clinch before being able to perform any wrestling moves this expands each superstar repertoire since once you locked up with an opponent you can now utilize either light or heavy grapples to inflict damage not only does this ensure more move variety but it also factors into how defending works in in previous games in the series the reversal button was your only recourse for escaping an onslaught of attacks it was too limiting and often resulted in situations where you were on the receiving end of attack after attack after attack the same system still exists only now you have additional defensive options when it comes to halting your opponent forward momentum not only can you dodge and block incoming strikes but you can also counter both combos and grapples by correctly guessing whether your opponent is using a light or heavy attackthese changes result in an enjoyable backandforth that more closely resembles the matches we see on tv every week they make the momenttomoment gameplay much more dynamic as well since you actually have to think about what your opponent is doing and also consider your own offense to ensure you not being too predictable a new stun mechanic helps balance these changes by making it so characters are unable to reverse when they seeing stars the animations are much more fluid now too on top of being particularly winceinducing at times there are still moments where characters will awkwardly teleport into place or get caught up in the ropes and the physics still have a tendency to break whenever ladders or cages are involved but these moments aren as frequent as they have been in the pasta few other legacy issues hold over as well mainly affecting multiperson matches tagteam ai is frustratingly inconsistent when it comes to preventing their opposite number from breaking up the pin and any match type with four or more superstars squaring off at the same time ends up lasting for far too long because there are so many broken pinfalls as a result most of the match types aren very enjoyable to play using weapons is also unwieldy especially when trying to set up a table or ladder plus signatures and finishers still require more than a single button press which makes performing running finishers overly clunkywhen it comes to game modes mycareer has been rebranded as myrise and sees you create a male or female superstar to take up through the ranks aside from being particularly bad the career mode in was also strictly linear that not the case here with a plethora of choices to be made that will shape how your created character career pans out there are two separate narratives depending on your gender all three brandsraw smackdown and nxthave around of their own storylines each and your heel or face alignment also factors into what side stories are available there a ton of replayability inherent in this structure and character creation isn limited because of restrictive loot boxes either as was the unfortunate case in now you have free reign to utilize the excellent creation suite to its fullestmyrise is also more grounded than absurd career mode so you won be fighting in the depths of hell or squaring off against samoa joe and his cybernetic arm there are some engaging pro wrestling storylines in particularly when you dive into the numerous side stories that pop up on social media one of the first i delved into saw my heel character align with shinsuke nakamura and a fictional character who trained with me at the wwe performance center after attacking big e a few times i earned a match for his intercontinental title which i eventually won after some heelish interference from my two faction members this in turn led to big e getting some measure of revenge until we settled things with a climactic title match inside hell in a cell stuff like this is compelling and separates myrise from the other game modes on offer the only downside is that all of the dialogue in this storyline and many others takes place on faux twitter voice acting occasionally pops up in cutscenes but most of it either tends to be stilted or sounds like it was recorded in somebody bathroomwhich may be a result of the pandemicwhile myrise straps you into the boots of an upandcoming star mygm puts you in a buttonedup suit and tasks you with booking a successful show each week you play as one of six onscreen bosses including stephanie mcmahon shane mcmahon sonya deville or even a general manager you created from scratch and pick one of four brands to manage each gm and brand has unique powerups to help you along the way then you compete against an ai or human rival to see who can book the best show starting with a superstar draft that only limited by your starting budget it tempting to simply pick the best superstars available but you have to be mindful of each one heel or face alignment and their synergy with one another fighters match up well with giants and cruisers for instance and you typically want your good guys facing your bad guysrather than running for an indeterminate amount of time however mygm is condensed to a season of or weeks this limitation seems to exist because the mode lacks any meaningful depth there are no secondary championships like the us title or tag team belts and the inclusion of a popularity stat means you forced to repeat matchups between the same few wrestlers over and over again until you can run enough promos to elevate some of the smaller stars you can immediately insert someone like ricochet into the title picture because no one will care and your match ratings will plummet as a result in many ways it reflective of the reallife wwe product where only a handful of superstars are able to move the needlethe wwe failure to create new stars is also evident in outdated roster this isn the fault of visual concepts of courseand it spoke to us about how it dealt with the evershrinking rosterbut vince mcmahon scorchedearth policy does impact the game by guaranteeing that it doesn resemble anything close to the current tv product so many members of the ingame roster have been released over the course of the pandemic that you can fill an entire royal rumble match with wrestlers who are no longer employed by the company william regal is one of the playable gms and he recently signed with rival aew while the likes of keith lee swerve strickland buddy matthews kyle o and jeff hardy will likely appear in both a wwe and aew video game this yearon the flip side the exclusion of other wrestlers is most keenly felt in showcase mode which chronicles the legendary career of rey mysterio this mode starts off by recreating the phenomenal match between rey mysterio and eddie guerrero at wcw halloween havoc during significant moments in the match the action will seamlessly transition from gameplay to archive footage which not only looks cool but puts the historical magnitude of the match into perspective rey provides commentary during these moments but it all in kayfabe so there very little actual insight the rest of his wcw career is sadly omitted along with huge chunks of his wwe career neither kurt angle chris jericho nor big show are in the game so instead of reliving rey memorable feuds with the legendary trio settles for a random raw match against gran metalik showcase is still enjoyable but the roster shortcomings prevent it from reaching its full potentialelsewhere myfaction is a new mode that sees attempt to cash in on the ultimate team concept featured in almost every other sports game you open packs to get cards and build a team of four men and four women then compete in various matchups to complete objectives and earn more cards and ingame currency it very grindy and the fouronfour bouts that regularly occur are lengthy and not particularly enjoyable because of the aforementioned issues the popular universe mode also returns only now you can choose to play as a single wwe superstar rather than focusing on running the entire company whoever you choose works with triple h to develop feuds construct tag teams fight for championships and more so there is still an element of universe mode bookingwwe is a surprising return to form after the shockmastersized disaster that was the extra year of development has done a world of good and the only hope now is that the series doesn return to an annual schedule there are still failings when it comes to multiperson matches and not all of the new modes are particularly engaging but establishes a solid foundation for the future ideally wwe will calm down when it comes to gutting its roster and the next game in the series won feel quite as outdated it will also be interesting to see how yuke upcoming aew game fares competition can only be a good thing,WWE 2K22 Review - Bad Times Don't

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghostwire-tokyo-review-shibuya-scramble/1900-6417848/,tango gameworks the evil within and its sequel are quintessential shinji mikami games brazenly following in the footsteps of resident evil by mixing survival horror and action with an overtheshoulder perspective the studio was never meant to be an avenue for mikami own creative vision though tango was established with the aim of showcasing new and talented young creators and ghostwire tokyo is the first game to really demonstrate this aspiration there nothing else that can compare to its peculiar brand of openworld exploration and supernatural combat as it borrows familiar elements and combines them with new ideas in imaginative and surprising ways it may stumble at times but the sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine throughghostwire tokyo story begins at a rapid pace with one of its protagonists lying dead on the floor after being involved in a fatal car accident on tokyo famous shibuya scramble crossing akito izuki is brought back from the dead when a shadowy spirit calling himself kk merges with his body the unholy union between the pair gives akito access to kk supernatural powers but before he even able to fathom what the hell going on the rest of tokyo residents are engulfed by a malevolent fog that blankets the entire city a menagerie of evil spirits known as visitors now roam shibuya streets in their stead so it up to akito and kk to put a stop to the masked villain responsible before the situation worsensyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing ghostwire tokyo reviewboth protagonists have different motivations for embarking on this dangerous quest beyond their responsibility to save the world kk is seeking revenge while akito is desperate to save his younger sister after she kidnapped by the villain for nefarious purposes the connection between akito and kk is the strongest aspect of ghostwire tokyo narrative as their budding relationship takes center stage and develops naturally over the course of the game the incidental banter between the pair adds levity to what is oftentimes bleak subject matter and it easy to become invested in their predicament even when the mysteries surrounding kk past are ultimately unfulfillingthe rest of the cast isn given enough screentime to really stand out or cultivate any kind of attachment so attempts to land an emotional payoff are stunted akito sister mari is a prime example of this as she more of a plot device than an actual character the villain is severely underutilized too his motives make him potentially sympathetic but instead he onenote and completely forgettable as a resultthe story shortcomings are disappointing considering the early potential of its alluring mysteries but even this isn enough to detract from ghostwire tokyo fantastic combat setting and worldbuilding when kk entwined with his body akito gained access to supernatural powers known as ethereal weaving granting him the ability to unleash projectiles from his fingertips ghostwire tokyo forgoes physical firearmsinstead akito is constantly contorting his hands and performing the finger gymnastics required to conjure spectral powers you start the game with access to wind weaving allowing you to pelt tokyo invading spirits with neon gusts of wind but by the end of the second chapter you also add both fire and water weaving to your repertoire the former unleashes a destructive missile that deals heavy damage while the latter horizontal burst and wide spread make it an obvious shotgun analog each flick of the finger discharges these soaring projectiles that collide with a palpable ferocity sending vibrant particles scattering into the night skyghostwire tokyo sheer creativity and attention to detail exhibited throughout constantly shine throughcombat takes a while to find its stride and feels stilted for the game first couple of hours mainly because the fire rate of wind weaving is painstakingly slow once you start delving into akito skill tree however this gradually begins to change increasing the rate of fire does wonders to the sense of impact and satisfaction that comes from rapidly blasting enemies away and the combat dynamism only continues to grow once you unlock more powers you start utilizing water weaving in closequarters to pulverize multiple enemies at once propel fire weaving flaming areaofeffect attack to damage some of the game toughest foes and throw magic talismans to lock visitors in placea significant reason why combat feels so gratifying is because of the way enemies react to your attacks you might be fighting apparitions that have some basis in japanese folklore but you constantly ripping off these digital chunks to reach the inner core festering below the surface all of the enemy designs feel like a reflection of tokyo and its people meshing modernity with the past just as towering skyscrapers cast shadows over traditional shinto shrines so too do these evil spirits emerge from contemporary issues the faceless umbrellawielding visitors are born from the hearts of those pushed to exhaustion by their work while the headless spirits scurrying around the city in school uniform are derived from the anxieties of studentsghostwire tokyo isn a particularly scary game despite these descriptions yet the atmosphere it conjures is unmistakably eerie an empty city is always going to be inherently unnerving but that especially true of one as populated and dense as tokyo this isn your typical postapocalyptic metropolis either as shibuya denizens have only recently vanished there are still signs of life everywhere you look with music emanating from the innards of karaoke bars led billboards illuminating the rainsoaked urban sprawl convenience stores welcoming your patronage with a merry jingle and shelves stacked with freshly wrapped onigiri and discarded clothes shoes umbrellas and phones strewn across the floor left behind by those consumed in the fogone glance at the map is enough to incur the dread of openworld fatigue yet the majority of the myriad icons simply represent shops you can visit to purchase healing items exploration never feels overwhelming mainly because you gain access to sections of the city in bitesized chunks by cleansing corrupted torii gates throughout shibuya you gradually disperse the harmful fog and reveal new side missions and collectibles these optional quests are concise vignettes that usually revolve around helping spirits that are trapped in a state of limbo this might include recovering cursed objects that were sold by a secondhand shop searching an otherwise quiet neighborhood for the source of ominous piano music or investigating a construction site where a rash of mysterious deaths has occurredyou can typically complete these side missions in a few minutes and their quality fluctuates wildly from one to the next at their best you unravel a compelling paranormal mystery that mixes combat and exploration at their worst you be thrown into a bland arena battle or have to tail a yokai for what feels like an eternity these side missions are never outright bad and they typically shed light on a particular facet of japanese folklore but too many of them lack depth and feel like they were included just to pad out the openworld activitiesfinding out that a nurikabe is essentially a big mattress that enjoys impeding pathways or that a kappa can resist a good cucumber is a part of what makes exploring ghostwire tokyo openworld such a joy it has an irreverent charm that pops up from time to time you can pet feed and read the thoughts of dogs for example and spiritual cats now run all of the city convenience stores because they need to earn enough money to purchase nether catnip you also use what known as a katashiro to consume friendly spirits and then feed them into a magic payphone to save them in exchange for money and xp and it all makes complete sense because tango gameworks has established such a tangible sense of placeghostwire tokyo doesn reinvent the wheel when it comes to openworld games but its unique setting tremendous attention to detail and singular combat make it stand out amongst its contemporaries the story stumbles and not all of the side missions are particularly engaging yet these aspects are easy to push to the back of your mind when you using finger guns to tear through corrupted spirits with dazzling aplomb shinji mikami is a legendary

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mlb-the-show-22-review-its-shotime/1900-6417858/,like its cover star shohei ohtani mlb the show excels on the field of play whether competing on the pitcher mound or in the batter box in the show case this has been the way for a number of years and improving on this consistent level of excellence is a tough ask but while ohtani has ambitions to build on last season historic mvp campaign mlb the show lacks that same drive and has generally stood pat the onfield action is largely unchanged from last year game aside from a few incremental improvements to aspects like fielding and ball physics new additions to some of the series longrunning modes are more significant but they don move the needle far enough and as a result the show yeartoyear progress since moving to nextgen consoles is still glacially slowit hard to have too many complaints once you step onto the diamond however hitting is still immensely satisfying and tweaks to the game ball physics ensure that there more hit variety than ever before the thunderous crack of the bat that occurs when you nail the perfect timing and contact is particularly pleasing especially when it results in a soaring moonshot that sends the ball careening into the bleachers pinpoint pitching has also been refined so it not quite as easy to execute as it was last year this results in more walks baserunners and high leverage situations that feel more authentic to the challenges pitchers face on a daily basisyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing mlb the show video reviewthe most noteworthy improvements occur when fielding the ball as a plethora of new animations make it a much smoother experience there a bigger separation between good and bad fielders with gold glovers taking better routes and reacting faster to fly balls whereas their lessthanstellar counterparts are more likely to commit errors and misplay the ball this has been the case in the past but it much more pronounced now because the players act and play more naturally none of this is groundbreaking of course but these subtle improvements help maintain the show foothold as one of the bestplaying sports games on the marketother additions to the onfield package are cosmetic there are some fancy new augmented realityesque graphics in the outfield before first pitch but it the new commentary duo that has the biggest impact matt vasgersian was the de facto voice of the show having held the role of playbyplay announcer since but he now been replaced by cubs and espn regular joe sciambi chris singleton is the latest in a revolving door of color commentators and the new broadcast booth does an admirable job of calling the action adding new perspectives and anecdotes in between plays without years of builtup lines to pull from however there is more repetition than in the past you hear a number of phrases repeated over and over again often in the very same game singleton goes on the same spiel whenever a player isn wearing batting gloves for instance and you hear the same line about a player being the full package both on and off the field over and over againmore egregious are the instances where they incorrectly state the number of outs or recount the history of fenway park when you playing at camden yards there also shouldn be situations where someone like babe ruth is referred to as number three but this occasionally happens with both former and current players even when their actual name is included in the game with commentary lines singleton and especially sciambi provide a solid baseline to build on for the future but there are some growing pains right nowwhen it comes to game modes mlb the show adds depth to the march to october mode by extending it from a single oneanddone season to multiple seasons this makes what was otherwise a complementary mode feel more like an expedited alternative to franchise with a full offseason of trades and free agency signings to delve into at the end of each year franchise mode is still present of course and expands on march to october truncated nature by letting you dive into the minutia of baseball and running a teamthere not really much else to say here though improved trade logic was touted as a vital inclusion prior to release but the cpu still has a habit of trading its top stars for relative peanuts developer sony san diego says a patch is in the works to rectify this issue but it a bit concerning that a noted improvement still isn working as intended and even if it was the show franchise mode is still lagging behind some of its contemporaries being able to customize leagues and divisions edit draft classes and play online would all be welcome additions as has been the case for multiple entries in the franchisemlb the show career mode road to the show is similarly lacking anything compellingly new or intriguingly different from what come before there are more liveaction podcast segments interspersed between your onfield exploits with the likes of ken griffey jr and joe mauer providing insight from a player perspective while minor league managers and even a mental performance coach explore other elements of being an upandcoming superstar these moments are interesting but they not always pertinent and don really add anything of note to your journey from the minor leagues to the show thankfully player progression is faster than it was last year and you can now create multiple ballplayers all with unique appearances which was a major oversight previously but without any meaningful improvements road to the show is beginning to wear thindiamond dynasty also returns and remains one of the better examples of the ultimate team concept aside from being the most generous cardcollecting mode on the market mlb the show adds a new singleplayer feature in the form of mini seasons this lets you take your custom team and compete for a playoff spot against a handful of fictional ai teams in a miniature league format games are only three innings long so it easy to work your way through the season relatively quickly earning program xp completing missions and upgrading your players as you go combine this with both showdown and conquest and you can have plenty of fun building a fantasy roster without ever venturing onlineif you do want to face off against other players however coop is another new addition to diamond dynasty suite of modes you can team up with one or two friends and play in twoontwo or threeonthree matchups against other human opponents there no genuine depth to these games since they only oneoff exhibitions and mlb the show take on baseball isn particularly conducive to engaging team play as each player takes turns batting pitching running and fielding as opposed to working together by simultaneously playing different positions it an enjoyable addition though with plenty of room to grow in future installmentsmlb the show still plays a fantastic game of baseball even if tweaks to fielding and hit variety are mere subtle improvements compared to anything more impactful additions to march to october and especially diamond dynasty enhance both modes while franchise and road to the show continue to stagnate by doing little else than treading water there still a ton of content to sink your teeth into and mlb the show will keep you busy into the winter months but it difficult to ignore how conservative the series has been for the past two years this is an excellent sports game just as mlb the show was the problem is that the list of reasons to upgrade is getting smaller and smaller,MLB The Show 22 Review - It's Shotime,en,607.0,Positive

rumble a brandnew entry in the longrunning warcraft franchise that marks its debut on mobile devices a closed beta test was also announced as coming soon on both ios and android deviceswarcraft arclight rumble is a realtime strategy game where players will collect miniature versions of warcraft creatures and heroes build armies with those miniatures and wage small wars with big and nasty baddies minis will act autonomously when summoned defeating the opponent forces and eventually the big bad itself in the process minis can be earned through normal gameplay or purchased with realworld

attacking the opponent to learn more gamespot recently spoke with two key members of the game development team executive producer and vp vik saraf and technical director monte krol about how warcraft arclight rumble is the best way to bring the franchise to mobile devices for the first timewe spent time discussing the return to the strategy genre how fans of wow that may not be familiar with oldschool warcraft can enjoy the game and the technical challenges in bringing a game like this and its multiple formats to life we also touched on a few of the concerns fans may have with the mobile platforminapp purchases and energy systems employed by other gamesand how this game approaches themthis interview was conducted via video conferencing and edited for readability and clarityyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenterwhile warcraft arclight rumble has the classic look and feel of warcraft past it is not the traditional experience while you were in the concept phase was there some worry that the name warcraft next to something like this to garner some criticism from older fanskrol first and foremost this is a warcraft game it looks and feels very much like warcraft i been at blizzard a long time i worked on warcraft iii and its expansion way back when and i look at this and get excited because it something that been part of our dna for a long time i feel like it hitting that warcraft strategy feeling that we know really wellare you anticipating this to be a vehicle for players who are only familiar with world of warcraft to perhaps go back and check out classic warcraftkrol we hope so world of warcraft brought the franchise to so many people in a different way than it ever did in the strategy games i would love it if everyone who is familiar with the mmo had a chance to try this and get a taste of not just world of warcraft but the world of warcraftsiraf to add to that we definitely hoping this game can have a positive effect on everyone from those that may feel nostalgia for the warcraft strategy games to world of warcraft players to mobile players who have never tried warcraft beforewhat made the return to this strategy style the right call for this mobile game as opposed to for example a thirdperson action game bearing some resemblance to wowkrol there no one answer to that but the idea is that we always made games that we also want to play and we draw inspiration from a lot of different sources to do so i feel like the ideas for this game came out of enjoying a variety of mobile games and desktop experiences and thinking that we could bring something in the warcraft strategy element to a great mobile experiencesiraf at its core when we set out to start making this game a lot of it was influenced by as monte said games that we would want to see on a mobile device while tapping into the nostalgia of warcraft strategy rootsyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenterregarding the term tower offense mentioned in the trailer what went into the concept process of taking this unique approach to tower defensekrol the term tower offense really reflects strategy roots strategy games have always been about manufacturing an assault and unleashing it against an enemy in traditional strategy games it involved basebuilding and building the assault at the same time here we focus on the assault part but i feel like that gameplay idea has always been core to strategy gamesthe game features different heroes each with their own traits and abilities how will players go about collecting them are they all earned ingame is realworld currency involvedsiraf the player goals are to collect and upgrade minis each one based off of characters in the warcraft universe and you use them in realtime combat missions across a variety of game modes we do have an ingame shop but players can acquire these minis through earned gold by beating levels but there are inapp purchase opportunitiessome mobile games have an energy or timer system that says a player can progress until the timer runs out but you can purchase an item that will make the time go faster does this game have that or will players always have something to do every time they load the gamesiraf very glad you asked that question we do not have an energy system in warcraft arclight rumble when we set out to make this game it was to create something that has depth in multiple game modes that way whenever a player logs in they have something to do pve pvp coop etc all of those choices were intentional so you can enjoy the experience at any timeregarding the five different families listed in the video will there be a sort of rockpaperscissors aspect where one is more powerful than anotherkrol more than rockpaperscissors the power lies in how well a player synergizes their army within the family for example if you build an army with a leader from a specific family then build your army with minis from that same family you get bonuses that will make you stronger that said you can play however you want there freedom to mix and match between families there are other ways to build armies too you might want to use more siege units or a flying army and they also take advantage of a leader ability to buff an armysiraf there no one family or unit that more advantageous than another it all about how you customize your loadout per mission you can for example have a full alliance loadout if you want to but you can also mix alliance pieces with horde pieces and pieces from the other families and that intentional part of the strategy experience is when you going into a mission you want to recon the map you going into decide which units are best to attack the map layout and build your army accordinglyon the technical side what is one of the biggest challenges your team has faced in arclight rumble developmentkrol we love to bring an experience to as broad an audience as we can for as long as i worked on games it always been a point of pride to bring players a great experience on whichever device you using there a lot going on onscreen in arclight rumble with multiple minis attacking across the map at all times and we want that to play well and feel good the entire time we continue to work to make that happenvik had mentioned pvp and coop which we imagine is a technical beast of a challenge as well how much more difficult to work around things like ping and connection issues in a game like this and do you find pvp or coop implementation to be more challengingkrol i would say from my desk the way our game is built they actually very similar challenges making sure the singleplayer pve and the pvp experiences play very similarly in terms of overall feel that been one of the biggest technical challenges and so far they feel very similarwhile no set timetable for the game launch has been announced has planning begun for how you will continue to support arclight rumble even after the game is releasedsiraf before blizzard i worked in mobile games for two decades and one of the main goals of good mobile games is to be enjoyed for multiple years we have certainly been thinking about postlaunch content features events things like that but we are still working those details out a lot of those decisions will also be made by the players via our beta tests we want to hear feedback on this game and that can help inform our future direction for postlaunch supportwhen a fanbase hears the word mobile next to an announcement eyebrows can sometimes be raised what would you say to those skeptical about this project to address those concernssiraf one truth that i learned in my time in mobile games is that the most successful freetoplay games are exactly that free to play what i mean is they are wellbalanced allowing the player to progress and enjoy the game without spending a dime that was a foundational design philosophy here to build a game with every step of the player journey thought through so it can be enjoyed for many years without spending anything there is an ingame shop option yes but through natural progression the player can tap into strategy strengths and figure out how to defeat a boss with the minis they earned also in terms of pvp our matchmaking will group players of equal level so there will always be an even playing fieldkrol as we mentioned earlier strategy games are deeply a part of our dna hopefully people will give us a chance based on that alone but we also think it a fun game that fastpaced and lowrisk to try we hope you pull your phone out download it for free get a taste for it and hopefully that hooks peoplegot a news tip or

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-story-guide-the-frenzied-flame-and-the-games-bleakest-ending-explained/1100-6502538/?comment_page=1#comments-block-33580810,the world of elden ring is full of subplots and sidequests usually given to you by completely missable npcs who travel around the lands between stopping at various landmarks along the way some of them are the keys to new weapons armor or spells while others will unravel whole layers of lore and ingame mythology that will lead you to alternate endings and maybe change your understanding of your mission as a wouldbe elden lord altogetherthis is certainly the case with the frenzied flame one of elden ring most dense and most easily missed side stories that will walk you down an entirely new path on your quest to the erdtreewhich will even make for some new enemies and some ominous foreshadowing of the future should you choose to see this quest throughso what exactly is the frenzied flame and what does it have to do with elden ring story the answer is a little complicated so strap inand brace for a lot and we do mean a lot of major game spoilers along the waymore elden ring story explainerselden ring story guide here the lore of the lands betweenone of the key components of elden ring internal mythology is the idea of the greater will which is what known as an outer god or an eldritch force that is exerting its influence on the lands between via conduitsregular gods like marika there a lot of finer points and insandouts to being a god outer or otherwise in elden ring but for now its best to understand the outer gods in this story as puppet masters trying to pull the strings of the lands between while also existing firmly outside of the normal concept of realitythe greater will uses marika as a conduit but it also uses monstrous handlike creatures known as the two fingers to communicate at some point in the past it established the idea of the golden order a sort of quasireligious movement anchored by the communication of the two fingers and marika reign that believed in a divine plan or set of rules for all life in fact we even have the names of two of those rules ingame as incantations known as the law of causality and the law of regressionput simply the greater will has a very strict view of how things work and how life must functionand unsurprisingly not everyone is super eager to go along with it especially if they don quite see eyetoeye with those rules one such dissenter is another outer god popularly known as the frenzied flamethe frenzied flame is in essence the exact opposite of the greater will where the greater will instills rigid order and strict laws the frenzied flame instillswell frenzy absolute chaos madness and in the words of some of their faithful a complete breakdown of everything that divides and distinguishesthe greater will may have been the top dog in terms of influence in the lands between prior to the shattering and subsequent decay but it was never without challengers it hard to tell just when or how the frenzied flame began to take root within the population but evidence suggests it been around for a whileand in fact has been actively buried by the greater will loyalists in an effort to keep it hidden and locked away there only one piece of concrete text in the game pointing to any sort of origin found on the incarnation the howl of shabriri which reads it is said that the sickness of the flame of frenzy began with shabriri the most relieved man in all historymore on shabriri in a secondnow while these two are far from the only outer gods in elden ring mythology they seem to be the two most closely related to one another while the greater will uses the two fingers as conduits the frenzied flame uses a creature called the three fingers for itself this could potentially suggest that the two of them are in fact one entity that was bifurcated somehow into two opposing forcesthis is further implied by dialogue later in the game with an npc hyetta who explains all that there is came from the one great then came fractures and births and souls but the greater will made a mistake torment despair affliction every sin every curse every one born of the mistake and so what was borrowed must be returned melt it all away with the yellow chaos flame until all is one again though the possibility for unreliable narration certainly shouldn be discountedso now that the shattering has occurred many of the fingers are dead and the lands between is in a state of extreme decline the frenzied flame is among the many powerful forces trying to make a move to do this it like the other outer gods needs the help of some powerful loyalistswhile the greater will may rely on everyone from tarnished fundamentalists to spurned demigods the frenzied flame keeps things a bit more lowkey in terms of its followers and conduits the first hints of the frenzied flame you likely to find in your adventure are an item called shabriri grapes which despite the name aren fruit at all but rotten eyeballs plucked from the sockets of mostly willing donors looking to give their grapes to maidens you eventually be able to give these grapes to one such maiden a blind girl named hyetta who is on a quest to follow the guidance of a distant light that she can only see once she eaten a grapeoh and yeahshe does think they literal grapes don worry you eventually get to tell her what she eating it doesn go well but doesn change her mind about it eitherhyetta begins her mission believing that she going to become a finger maiden as a servant of the greater will but somewhere along the way decides that she actually better suited to a different power she makes this choice after you feed her a fingerprint grapeyes another eyeballthis time from an invading tarnished warrior who was scorched by the flame of frenzy this tarnished named vyke also drops some items with even more clues talking about how he was once very close to becoming elden lord but ventured deep below the capital where he was burned by the flame leaving finger print marks melted into his flesh and armorvyke himself can be found at a whole corner of the map devoted to the frenzied flame in the northern corner of liurnia where a village has apparently succumbed to the flame influence wholesale they even have a guard tower that will inflict madness on anyone approaching presumably to both guard their little community and grow their numbers it also worth noting that the church within the village is called ironically the church of inhibitionwhich may imply that the flames took root here with some deliberate sense of irony seeing as inhibition is defined as the restraint against expressing an instinct or you know the exact opposite of being frenzied if this is the case it points even more strongly to the possibility of the frenzied flame and the greater will being more than any other outer gods diametrically opposed enemies or rivals a sort of eldritch batman and the joker if you willas opposed to the other big powerful forces around the lands between that seem pretty happy to do their own things or pursue their own goalsthe residents of the frenzied flame village aren the only followers to be found however eventually if you follow the questline given to you by yura a samurai and bloody finger hunter you first meet in limgrave you be able to meet shabriri himselfthe guy who named the grapes and apparently started the frenzied flame fad in addition to the grapes and the incarnation he also has a talisman named after himshabriri woewhich states that he had his eyes gouged out as punishment for the crime of slander and with time the bright flame of the frenzy came to dwell in the empty socketsif you couldn tell the eye theme is pretty prominent hereshabriri doesn seem to have a physical form anymore and instead manifests within the corpse of yura which he apparently reanimated to speak with you and once again impress upon you the importance of venturing below the capital to find a well hidden secret the incentive he offers you is the safety of melina explaining that if you embrace the frenzied flame she won have to sacrifice herself to burn the erdtreeyou have your own fire to get the job doneclearly it a manipulative tacticvyke armor set implies that the same pitch was given to him at some point in the past did he make his choice for his maiden or did some other force lure him with suggestionif you do make the long trek down below leyndell already subterranean system of jails you find a sort of mausoleum filled to the brim with the dead and the nearly dead another thing you likely recognize immediately is that the corpses littering and we do mean littering there hardly any space to walk this place are all merchants yes merchants the friendly guys who you no doubt been meeting along your travels who are always happy to sell you useful stuff the handful that do still survive somehow are playing the simple stringed instrument some merchants carry with thema melody you probably recognizean explanation for this grisly mausoleum can be found in the description of the nomadic merchant finery which reads these merchants once thrived as the great caravan but after being accused of heretical beliefs their entire clan was rounded up and buried alive far underground then they chanted a curse of despair and summoned the flame of frenzymore context about the great caravan and the merchants can be found in some cut content datamined from previous builds of the game where kalethe first merchant you meethad a quest to uncover his own roots leading him to eventually succumb to the flames himselfthere a bit of a chickenegg dilemma happening here with the merchant tribe and shabriri as well both of which seem to be guilty of summoning the flame of frenzy in one way or another it possible that shabriri was part of an ancient merchant tribe himself and that his crimes of slander were punished so harshly because of the strong oral traditions shared by the nomadic merchants around the continentbut there concrete evidence either wayonce you reach the very bottom of the mausoleum you find yourself before a massive fleshy door if you also done hyetta quest up to this point she be miraculously waiting for you to explain that you can only be granted an audience with the three fingers if you remove all your clothesdoing so will allow you to enter and confront the monsterbut don worry it not a fight instead the three fingers will embrace you and sear their fingerprints into your flesh much like they did to vyke before you this will prompt hyetta to offer herself up as your new maiden because melina will promptly abandon you if you decide to travel down this path unfortunately for hyetta however anointing her with the flames she seems to desire so much will ultimately kill herso much for shabriri promise of saving a life huh though given shabriri own ability to bodysnatch corpses and exist without his original form maybe this is all part of the plan we can be certain one way or anotherso what was the point of all this you may askwell once you been anointed with the mark of the three fingers you are locked into a specific ending for the game it doesn matter how many potential mending runes you collected or which other quests you completed if you got the fingerprints on your skin you stuck that is unless you gather miquella needle from defeating malenia which will allow you to remove the mark of frenzy from your body the needle item description specifically notes that it was made to ward off the meddling of outer gods and that it allows one to cheat fate and avoid becoming the lord of frenzied flameif you do not use the needle however you will get the frenzied flame ending which iswell pretty bleak unlike the other endings which include a voiceover announcing the dawning of whichever age you picked the frenzied flame ending includes only ominous silence and the world being engulfed in sickly yellow flameswhich oh yeah have also replaced your head the roaring flames continue uninterrupted until melina assuming she survived the game is given a little cutaway scene where she promises to hunt you down and deliver your destined deathnow melina story motivations allegiances and relationship to various outer gods is a whole other can of worms but it still worth noting that her design has changed slightly in this brief scene her closed eye is now openand visibly blindand her hand is prominently scarredmelina presence in this ending doesn tell us much but it does confirm that despite the absolutely apocalyptic appearance of the world life in some form or another still apparently is able to persist in the lands between that or maybe melina is an extraordinarily special case still there a lot of unanswered questions as to what exactly a world ruled by chaos incarnate actually means and how things would progress under this particular brand of rulesome other frenzied flame adjacent items in the game such as the eye of yelough a rather disgusting looking herb seems to imply that life is definitely possible in some form or another in lands affected by frenzy its description reads grown in lands afflicted by frenzy it used for its painrelieving propertiesthough it also known to be a dangerous intoxicant the name yelough also appears in the name of some ruins found in the consecrated snowfield which may or may not be pointing toward the existence of an entityeither another outer god or another outer godlike creature or perhaps even another name for the frenzied flame itselfthat controls or thrives in frenzy it worth pointing this out if only because melina will warn you in no uncertain terms that the flames of frenzy are basically antithetical to lifemeanwhile the existence of crafting books such as the frenzied cookbook explain that people afflicted by frenzy were discovering new techniques and items to make in desperation and were actually healed by frenzytouched items once they themselves were infectedso what does all this actually mean in the bigger picture it difficult to saythe best we can do is hope for a future dlc that will touch more about the relationships between the outer gods and maybe even something that picks up the threads of

owners to the dualsense and its myriad of new features throughout its more than vibrant and colorful levels scattered across six worlds astros playroom makes great use of the dualsenses haptic feedback and adaptive triggers which truly immerse you further into the game it also an ode to playstation history with easter eggs from the games and tech that made the platform iconic through the years astros playroom is a simply delightful platformer that would be worth the full price of admission and its certainly the game you should play first on to marvel at the innovationsee our astro playroom reviewchicory a colorful tale started its life as a playstation console exclusive before being ported to nintendo switch that said we argue that the best way to play chicory is on in large part due to the dualsense haptic feedback a colorful tale sees you take up a magical brush after the previous wielder abandons the tool with the brush you can color in a colorful tale blackandwhite world as you see fit using paint to solve puzzles and help people with their problems to explain why a colorful tale is so special would be to spoil one of the best games of just know that this game has mechanics and puzzles that cleverly embody its themes of selfdoubt and the frustration of feeling directionless and don worry it not all doom and glooma colorful tale includes plenty of charming moments and silly jokes that are sure to make you smile it easily earns its spot on this list as one of the best gamessee our chicory a colorful tale reviewwhile control was a great game when it launched in it had some issues with performance on especially on base models with the power of the control runs amazingly well the particle physics really pop in and the performance is silky smooth the ultimate edition comes with both of controls expansions which expand on a story thats full of surprises and gripping performances in control you play as jesse faden the new director of the federal bureau of control a secretive agency that investigates supernatural events controls combat is thrilling with a great mix of standard thirdperson gunplay and abilities that ooze with style the story is thoughtprovoking and at times mindbending its also elevated by a foreboding atmosphere and beautiful art style if you missed out on control the first time around you can now play it in its ideal form on our control reviewdeathloop is one of the best console exclusives thus far which is pretty ironic considering it was developed by arkane lyona bethesda studio that is now owned by microsoft the

where the party never stops and everyone wants to kill our protagonist colt the island is stuck in a time loop and the only way to break it is by hunting down and killing a list of targets colt retains his memories from each loop but so do all of his targets they know he coming deathloop is an absolutely enthralling shooter that deftly weaves into systems into the loop in a coherent manner that gradually builds over time it also tells a gripping tale and features some incredible acting it earned a rare in our reviewsee our deathloop reviewdemons souls kicked off this generation in style by showing what the can do bluepoint games remake of the actionrpg that ushered in the iconic souls series runs like a dream this shouldnt come as much of a surprise considering bluepoint also developed the gorgeous shadow of the colossus remake that said remaking a game with such a devoted following is risky but thankfully bluepoint remained faithful to the original while drastically overhauling the visuals and overall presentation the result is a great game made even better demons souls haunting environment and dangers that lurk within are all the more present with the absurd level of detail on display heresee our demon souls reviewdestiny just keeps getting better the recently released witch queen campaign takes bungie online shooter to new heights in terms of story and

the fight overall the technical improvements and new content make dmc special edition worth playing even if you already beat the original on its one of the best action games in recent years and includes one of the deepest combo systems ever in the genresee our devil may cry reviewwhen the lifecycle comes to an end it seems likely that elden ring will be in contention for the best game period as one of the highest rated games of all time on metacritic it safe to say that elden ring matched and exceeded from software fans lofty expectation elden ring plays much like the dark souls series but it set in an absolutely massive open world in traditional from software fashion elden ring lets its world do most of the storytelling the world is utterly captivating and replicates the sense of adventure found in another genredefying open world game breath of the wild like all soulsbourne games elden ring has demanding and methodical combat systems that can seem like a big mountain to climb it worth scaling this beast though elden ring is the best open world game on right now it earned a rare in our elden ring reviewsee our elden ring reviewfinal fantasy vii remake earned a rare from

skyrim mod it takes place in a roman city that abides by the golden rule that is if anyone sins the gods will punish everyone equally for their discretion you essentially play as a detective conversing with people across the city and solving puzzles while trying to get to the bottom of the central mystery the forgotten city has a time loop mechanic so if the golden rule is applied the loop starts over it a wholly engrossing experience thanks to its clever writing engaging puzzles and great atmospheresee our the forgotten city reviewghost of tsushima was the last major exclusive to release on and made the most of the hardware since it already looked incredible and ran extremely well the free upgrade makes the details of tsushimas lush open world even more rich and expressive if you missed out on ghost of tsushima at the end of the lifecycle the upgrade which supports gameplay at and resolution makes it look and feel like a native game you play as jin sakai a samurai who barely staves off a violent death and sets off on an adventure to thwart the first mongol invasion of japan ghost of tsushima has great fluid combat and wellintegrated stealth mechanics the openworld quest structure does feel fairly familiar but all of the other aspects make it worth the occasional repetition outside of the campaign theres a surprisingly awesome coop multiplayer mode dubbed legends that adds numerous new layers to an alreadygreat gameyou can also opt for the director cut which includes a brandnew story expansion that adds to the overall narrativesee our ghost of tsushima reviewone of the most stunning games is even prettier on the update adds a performance mode with resolution that runs at while god of war didnt necessarily need an updateits an awesome game regardlessthe higher resolution and frame rate make the environments more gorgeous and the combat more fluid god of war is one of the best playstation exclusives in a long time already so its definitely worth revisiting or playing for the first time on god of war elevates the series to new heights thanks to a more cohesive personal story about fathers and sons and methodical combat that still retains all the style the franchise is known for action game aficionados shouldnt miss out on god of warnote that ps plus members can play god of war for free as part of the playstation plus collectionsee our god of war reviewthough it doesn have much competition gran turismo is the best racing game on playstation so far that probably not much of surprise considering the franchise

interesting stealthaction series ever made hitman caps off the world of assassination trilogy on an alltime high note for the franchise as a whole the hallmark of the trilogy has been player choice in intricate sandboxstyle levels and that is readily on display in hitman giving players a dizzying number of ways to tackle objectives as agent brilliant level design is complemented by lively characters who draw you into this mesmerizing and often absurd world hitman also places a greater emphasis on its story which trickles down to the atmosphere to create a campaign that feels more consequential if you havent played the previous two games wed recommend picking those up too every level from the first two games can be imported into hitman with visual and gameplay enhancementssee

explore while there might actually be too many systems in forbidden west those who like these sorts of openworld games will undoubtedly appreciate how much there is to see and dosee our horizon forbidden west reviewthe second cooperativeonly game from hazelightthe studio behind a way outit takes two is a much more successful effort because actually controlling the characters doesn feel like an afterthought it a delightful and experimental platformer set in a fantastical world imagined by a girl during her parents heartbreaking divorce and both mom and dad are forced to work together as they rekindle their lovevia puzzles and jumping challenges of course frequently hilarious and with inventive ideas in nearly every area it takes two is the work of a studio that truly understands its strengths and where its previous games could have been better and despite director josef fares outspoken often vulgar statements making him more of a meme than a man he is also a true creative force the oscars may have abandoned him but the video game industry sure hasnt and it tough to imagine him topping it takes two with his next gamesee our it takes two reviewthe ultimate edition of marvels spiderman miles morales comes with the remaster of one of the best games and its impressive followup the remastered version of marvels spiderman runs wonderfully on and makes use of the powerful hardware to offer several modes that boost frame rate and visual quality marvels spiderman also tells a heartwarming and grounded story filled with adept characterization and superb pacing even if you already played the original on the remastered version is worth running through againmarvels spiderman miles morales is a more compact experience think uncharted lost legacy but it uses the strong foundation of its predecessor well miles comingofage story is a joy to watch unfold and the story has plenty of twists of turns together these two games make quite the duo and should be in every

lovable new character rivet who teams up with the iconic duo after they thrust into an alternate dimension with gorgeous visuals immersive dualsense functionality and new traversal tools that refine platforming and combat ratchet clank rift apart was one of the first games that felt truly nextgen and is a mustplay for any ownerssee our ratchet clank rift apart reviewa sequel to resident evil biohazard and the series second mainline game to use firstperson view resident evil village is more than just the memes about its tall vampire lady ethan winters second outing is often terrifying delving into psychological horror more than nearly any other game in the series but it also manages to feel like a best of compilation of other resident evil games cherrypicking elements for its four main sections one retains the nailbiting tension of constant pursuit seen in resident evil while another focuses more heavily on the action of resident evil and in the game scariest area it leaves resident evil and goes fullon pt in a very uncomfortable way but capcom smartly limited this to a very small portion of the overall experience so people didn stop playing in fear it not the most even resident evil game everit bookended by some pretty mediocre battlesbut when it hits its stride resident evil village is the series at its peaksee our resident evil village reviewreturnal is not a game for everyoneit extremely difficult and its roguelite structure can feel overwhelming at firstbut those who keep playing will be rewarded with one of housemarque best games essentially a aaalevel thirdperson shooter with arcade sensibilities it retains the essence of housemarque older smaller games like nex machina and resogun with dodging through enemy projectiles and memorizing their attacks

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review-wow-cool-robot/1900-6417569/,despite what the box and blurbs might tell you sentinels aegis rim isn really a game about piloting giant robots i mean sure you do fight off massive swarms of buildingsized creatures hellbent on total destruction in an alternateuniverse japan at some points but these seemingly modelkitready metal combat suits are just a plot device a cog in the story in actuality sentinels aegis rim is a character drama a twisting turning scifi epic jumping through time and dimensions as it follows the lives of its numerous teen protagonists missiles gatling guns and armorcrushing metal fistcuffs are merely a side event to the everyday drama of highschoolers who find themselves unwilling pawns in a bigger game with the fate of the world at stake and you know what that great once the narrative of sentinels sinks its hooks into you you want nothing more than to go along for the ride up until the very sentinels is a unique genremixing experiment it takes elements of pointandclick adventure games visual novels realtime strategy games and tower defense games mixing them together to create an experience that quite unlike anything else out there things get rolling when young japanese highschooler juro kurabe is called upon to fight a horde of alien invaders in only for the story to flash back to earlier that year then over to young soldiers in wartimeera japan then to two schoolgirls witnessing a crisis in the year you immediately meet a huge cast of characters across different eras learning that there is one constant the existence of sentinels massive humanpiloted robot weapons who exist to protect the world from otherworldly monstersthe game is split into three parts a remembrance mode where you uncover the story piece by piece a destruction mode where you use giant sentinel mechs to protect the city from invasion and an analysis mode that collects all of the information and story scenes you have discovered through gameplay remembrance is presented as an episodic series where you explore and interact with various environments and characters to advance the plot destruction in contrast is an overheadview strategy segment where you use the sentinels to defend a critical underground access point from invading forcesthe narrative sequences of remembrance take up the good majority of the game playtime each of the main characters individual adventures occurs at a different time and place but every story eventually intertwines with some crucial events playing out through the perspectives of several cast members gameplay is fairly basic you can walk around to talk to other characters stand around to observe the environment and examine particular objects in an area occasionally key words will be added to a character thought cloud which acts like an item inventory you can ruminate on the topics via an inner monologue bring up thought cloud topics to others or utilize physical items progress happens when you hit on the right dialogue or actionyou only control one character at a time but you can swap between characters stories as you see fitthough you may find yourself locked out of a character path until you have made significant progress in others storylines and the mech battles the nonlinear nonchronological storytelling presents you with many mysteries and questions which you must piece together to get a bigger picture of what is actually going onand how to save everything from absolute sentinels does a great job telling an engaging story from several perspectives not only does everything fit together but the characters have distinct welldefined backgrounds and personalities to avoid confusing the audience each of these characters individual adventures is a treat to unravel as more and more important events revelations and romantic entanglements come to lightthere juro a nerd who loves obscure scifi bmovies and hanging out with his best friend after school he shares a class with iori a somewhat clumsy girl who keeps falling asleep during school because terrifying dreams keep her up at night meanwhile resident ufo and conspiracy nut natsuno may have just found the secret of a timetravelling alien civilization in the girls locker room she just met keitaro a guy who seems to have been spirited here from wartime japan and who also might have a thing for her shu is a spoiled kid with a thing for the school resident tough girl yuki who is too busy investigating mysteries around school to care for his advances but why is ryoko bandaged up constantly monitored and gradually losing her sanity and why is megumi hearing a talking cat ordering her to attack her classmatesthat just a sampling of the many character minidramas you see throughout the game as the ordinary lives of these kids get flipped upside down and a massive realitychanging mystery unfolds ultimately however the story works because the individual character drama is so well done with each character tale playing a key role in the bigger overarching scifi plotit also helps that the story sequences in sentinels are fantastic to look at developer vanillaware is known for its vibrant colorful artwork in games like odin sphere and dragon crown while sentinels takes place primarily in a more realworld setting than those fantasybased games the beauty of vanillaware artwork is still on full display the environments are filled with little details that really make them come alive from the reveling drunken benchsquatters by the train station entrance to the crumbling shaking foundations of ruined buildings in the apocalyptic futures barely standing among the husks of dead invaders character animation is also excellent with many characters featuring fun little facial and body movement quirks that bring out elements of their personalitiesperhaps the biggest problem with the story segments however is that they are notably more enjoyable than the realtime strategy portion where the gigantic sentinels are supposed to really shine the destruction portion of the game is a mix of quasirts and towerdefense mechanics you command up to six individual sentinel units in a usuallytimed battle to protect a defensive node from a lengthy enemy onslaught each unit has a specialized role such as melee support flying etc and offensive and defensive skills which can be individually upgraded to your liking through metachips earned in battle and from completing story episodes if you either wipe out all of the enemies or manage to hold the fort for a specific amount of time you winthese battles certainly have their moments it immensely satisfying to plan out a strategy and watch it play outor to decide to go ham with your best weapon and watch a couple dozen enemy drones explode simultaneously in a flurry of fireworks which are enough to make a standard model slow down eventually however the game stops introducing new and interesting threats making these strategy bits feel less exciting as you progress the gorgeous visuals and animation are also replaced with a bland blocky map that isn anywhere near as pleasant to look at for long stretches of time while there a good amount of intercharacter bantering and key story revelations before and after these combat sequences you can help but feel like they can often be a roadblock to enjoying the more interesting story parts of the gameespecially since clearing certain enemy waves in destruction is necessary to open parts of the story in remembrancefor switch players sentinels aegis rim has made the transition to nintendo semiportable platform with very few compromises everything from the playstation original is here and looking great the adventure scenes and cinematics are as gorgeous as ever and for the most part the strategy sections only suffer a minor hit to visuals and performance when compared to the original there is a slight amount of slowdown during sections where a lot is happening on screen though you likely won even notice the difference unless you played the version extensively new to the switch version are some additional weapon options for each of the robotic sentinel units they nice additions but hardly gamechanging given the original weapon spread was more than sufficient to complete the game with overall this is a superb port worth picking up if you have yet to play this amazing titleor if you want to experience the enthralling saga all over againultimately the biggest problem with sentinels is that a chunk of the game is merely good while the majority of it is outstanding the stories of these kids and their giant robots absolutely consumed me during my playtime and even now i ruminating over certain plot points events and relationships wondering if i should go back through the archives to see what i missed i don think i forget my time in the sentinels world and i doubt you will

rainbow six mobile a full port of multiplayer firstperson shooter rainbow six siegethe core format of siegethe attackers versus defenders format featuring unique operators on each sidewill be rainbow six mobile core gameplay experience the team is hoping for to operators available at launch while only the bank and border maps have been confirmed so farrainbow six mobile will also retain siege environmental destruction mechanics allowing players to employ the same types of strategies in the mobile version of the game that they would in the full console experience players interested in trying out this mobile siege experience can sign up for a chance to be part of upcoming tests at the game official websiteubisoft says the game has been optimized for mobile platforms citing things like customizable control schemes as key features to learn more gamespot recently spoke with two key members of the game development team lead game designer olivier albarracin and creative director justin swan about what makes siege fit on ios and androidwe spent time discussing technical aspects that needed to be considered the lengths the team has gone to preserve the core siege experience and how the team is choosing which operators and maps to bring to rainbow six mobile first we also touched on the mobile scene itself specifically how the shooter genre may see a renaissance on mobile similar to another shooter boom over years agothis interview was conducted via video conferencing and edited for readability and claritywhat would you say is the biggest hurdle in porting rainbow six siege to mobile based on the video it a very close representation but what was the biggest challengealbarracin there were a lot of challenges to bringing siege to mobile and our philosophy was to stay true to what the core siege experience is but adapt the controls and the systems for the mobile experience we weren trying to remove any of the core consolepc features but instead find a way for them to be more natural to execute on mobilein terms of specific challenges there so many different mobile devices we have to account for things like screen sizes and aspect ratios however we knew the core aspects of siege are complex with things like gathering intel before the fight begins so we used session length as one of the pillars of our thought process using that it allowed us to balance the game tighten the siege experience while also improving animations reload times movement speed etc overall this game experience is faster and that helps us find that siege experience since players want to jump into a quick game and get out first in minutes you have a full siege matchswan this has been a very complicated process because siege is such a complicated game in so many directions the design direction as far as all of the complex interactions the challenge of bringing a new player onboard teaching them how to play and having them be excited to play etc we put a lot of effort into that onboarding process bringing in things like the siege academy to teach classes on how to playthe technical side had huge hurdles as well starting with bringing siege signature world destruction to the game one decision we made early on is we can do predefined destruction which does happen in most games especially on mobile if there things a player can destroy it predetermined that they will break into the same size pieces in the same places that not how siege works doing that would take a lot away from the strategy and creativity of the game because of this we have full procedural destruction in the gameit also an inside game a lot of the game takes place in closequarters combat so you always close to the walls in indoor environments when you hug the walls you see the textures really up close rather than being outside in open air not paying as much attention to the environment that means of course that you have to have really high texture density which of course costs memory if you have destructible walls ten different operators all with their own abilities and animation systems huge maps with high pixel densities there so much going on and we thankful we have a genius tech team who have been creating miraclesin fact one was just created today we got our full facial rig into the game so operators are smirking and smiling and other expressions you don really see on mobile yet we building a lot of the tech that you see even in the open world games where it not drawing something that can be seen called culling or like as you get closer to an object its polygon count goes up and therefore the detail of that object goes up too there so much stuff going on under the hood it a super challenging game and i could go on forever but i really proud of it there not many companies that can put this much effort forward to bring an experience like this to mobile now that we here and we have something we feel good about it also extremely rewardinghearing minutes for a siege match is astounding what went into the thought process of making sure matches go by fasteralbarracin we were talking about a bestofthree format at one point but we also came to the reality that people are going to play games on their phones in short bursts like riding a train or on their break we wanted to make sure they get that highlytactical shooter in a short amount of time to do that we made spawn points closer to the buildings so attackers can move in quicker small adjustments like that it still all balanced so it still feels like the authentic siege experiencehow much of siege content is coming to mobile at launchalbarracin i can say exactly how much will be on the mobile version when we launch but i can say that the game will have two maps border and bank also we have a lot of usage and popularity data on operators both internally and through the community so we use that in our thought process for which operators we bring to rainbow mobileswan we definitely know our opening roster and those two maps will be part of our closed beta test coming up in the next couple of months we aiming for more maps when we launch worldwide this is a really interesting topic in siege as it doesn behoove you to have too much there so much strategy and tactics built into every map and every operator interaction too much content is very easily going to overwhelm a new playerwhen i was first learning siege my favorite thing to do was play on one map and learn every single thing about it and siege mobile will be the same way with bank and border we actually ended up with the debate of how many should we ship versus how many could we shipwe looking into operations when we launch with more to come via battle passes and other updatesdo you have a time window yet of how long your battle passes will runswan we going a bit crazy with this one we thinking six weeks for each one we have really been fleshing out our content pipeline because we know people consume mobile game content they into at a really fast pace so we want to make sure we have what the people want when they come we been really working a lot with all of our worldwide partners and all of the tech to make a content pipeline like that workwith these battle passes we going to be digging into the lore of rainbow six siege a lot more our fanbase loves it when we give them some lore but we don deal out too much so we really looking into what we can get into these battle passes like the side comicbook storylines interactions between operators things like thatwhen you say exploring the lore what sort of items will do thatswan we have a digital comic where you unlock panels as you proceed through the battle pass as you level up you gain panels that will digitize the game i can spoil the story obviously but that the kind of thing we trying to doonce rainbow six mobile launches and the games are running concurrently most of the time operators will come from siege to mobile would you ever consider debuting a new operator in mobile and then porting them to siegeswan this is something we definitely talked a lot about there so much meat on the bone when it comes to siege operators that we have a lot to work on there what nice too is those guys are geniuses the stuff they come up with the effort and thought they put into making new operators honestly it intimidating to think of making our own operator we super excited about the idea to do it but we have to figure out when the time is right as we have a lot of catching up to do firstdo you have a timeframe on getting caught up or do you have a target on when you want everything from consolepc siege into mobileswan i could do the math if i really wanted to but i haven really thought about that yet there so much there i think if you look at how many operators we have at launch you look at siege and how often they add operators versus our battle pass cadence you could land on a date but i not even sure what that date iswhen adapting the control scheme to a touchscreen was there a certain mechanic that was difficult to port from consoles to pc or did everything seem to fit where it shouldalbarracin we really wanted it to be easy to focus on making it easy to execute actions for one example we added autosprinting and autovaulting on consoles and pcs if you going to walk run and vault over an object that three separate inputs you have to consider on mobile that action would be just a flick of the thumb of course if players wanted those settings we have a ton of customizable settings including a customizable hud with moveable input areas to make controlling the game much easier for mewe also have more innovative features like a lean slider where you slide your finger left or right the character will start to lean like you do in siege if you doubletap the screen you do a melee attack i missing a lot more but these are the main onesseeing how robust the siege esports scene is is rainbow six mobile esports something the team is consideringswan we certainly love to getting into the esports space is good for any game but for us we really just focused on making the best game possible not just a game that can be an esport we looking at smooth and fluid fps gameplay stable connections that hold that framerate serverauthoritative pvp to deter cheaters and hackers and things like that what we focused on the most is making and shipping a game that at some point can be an esport but is the best gaming experience it can be for all players right when it launchesfinally some players may hear the word mobile and turn up their noses playing the old hits like mobile is just crushing candies or mobile is just gacha games that take your money what would you say to those players about how this game is differentswan first off just take a look at the market of full experience mobile games right now people are having rich experiences right on their phones and tablets and they able to bring those experiences with them wherever they go you can see pretty easily that the market is maturing a lotfor shooters specifically i think we in a really interesting place if you go back to what bungie did with halo before the days of xbox no one took console shooters seriously you had games like goldeneye and perfect dark which were both great but those were games you played splitscreen against your brother or sister or friends and they weren taken seriously bungie comes along with so many cool innovations like snaptoaim sticky reticle making the maps a lot smaller with more close quarter combat and suddenly shooters had finally happened on consolenow years later it the biggest genre in gaming i think we starting to see some similar breakthroughs in the mobile market and that why we invested so much time in prototyping making breakthroughs etc i think we there just give it a try put some time into it and i think you see it a really complete and solid experiencegamespot may get a

point with developer respawn seemingly putting a greater emphasis on implementing playervsenvironment pve play with the addition of imc armoriesevery battle royale map in apex legends has its own flavor and storm point has leaned towards pve from the very beginning launching with prowler and spider nests scattered throughout the wildlife presented a riskvsreward system for players moving

newcastle stories from the outlands herofighting off prowlers or spiders also ran the risk of creating enough racket to attract nearby squads sandwiching you between the wildlife and other players few things in apex legends are more nervewracking than hearing the slow windup of an enemy devotion in one ear and the hungry roar of a prowler in the otherfrankly it all isn very good in its current form the potential loot that you can earn for killing prowlers or spiders usually isn worth the risk of getting thirdpartied by another squad and storm point has enough lanes that you can easily find means of getting around any nests you don want to contend within the first few rings it ultimately results in most folks myself included wanting to avoid the pve and getting frustrated if said pve ever becomes unavoidable late into the match and contributes to a lossrespawn has presumably taken fans complaints with storm point pve to heart adding a new source of pve conflict for players and ensuring they are tucked away from the rest of the pvp action these new enemies are spectres and they locked away in imc armories four of these armories are being added to storm point in season each presenting a new way for squads to quickly acquire decent loot the prowlers and spiders will remain as is meaning issues with the wildlife will persist into season but the imc armories at least sound like a more enjoyable way to partake in pve in what is primarily a pvp battle royalethe imc armories were first seen in the launch trailer for apex legends season though they don quite work as seen in that cinematic that the cinematic version of the armories let put it that way respawn senior game designer samantha kalman told gamespot so the way the armories work is there are four of them around the map they have six weapons inside so enough for each squad member to get two but they random there no other loot inside until you activate combat there a central console to activate combatthat closes the front door preventing any enemies from getting inside to thirdparty you for the duration of the encounter if one of your squadmates gets left behind there a teleporter that they can use and only friendlies can use it to get insidebecause the imc armories close back up and no enemy squads can get in once your team has activated them it prevents the possibility of getting thirdpartied kalman explained that the combat inside the armory is wavebased with teams having a total of seconds to clear as many enemy spectres as they can each wave cleared unlocks an additional loot bin these bins utilize the same smart loot feature that spiders and prowlers do so they always provide an upgrade to your current gear giving players a means of upgrading their weapon attachments or finding a muchneeded hopupand every time that there are enough smart loop bins for each player on the squad to get their own each player then gets a dedicated smart loot bin kalman said so clear at least three waves with a full squad and no one will have to squabble for the rewarded lootevery person will get their own upgraded loot devoted to their current equipped kityou don have to worry about a squad potentially ambushing you on the way out either once you made it through your seconds of combat the doors will remain closed until you press a button to open the armory back up doing so also opens up the roof as well and activates a skydive launcher so squads can figure out the loot situation heal up and then open the doors and if a team is outside you can just redeploy to another locationthe point is that this is a pve minigame designed to fit inside a battle royale match which is inherently pvp kalman said so we want to give players a little break from the pvp if they want it but we don want to take all the emphasis away from pvpas to the difficulty of the spectresthey supposedly comparable to those you encounter in titanfall and titanfall on their own they don pose much of a threat but if you up against a wave of four spectres while solo you may be in trouble in order to avoid getting wiped by the robot soldiers or dying to the ring while inside an armory you can activate the exit on the armory early ending the seconds of waves it will prevent you from getting more loot but allow you to make a hot exit if the situation is looking diceyregarding other instances of pve season also adds another prowler nest in the cenote cave additionally the prowler nest near the mill has been updated with the addition of more rocks that present new traversal options for players and hungry prowlers alike and the individual web sacks that make up the spider nest at command center have all been brought closer togetheryou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to

ring is a broad confusing onelike the elden ring itself it fractured made up of tiny pieces as its different characters serve a variety of masters and enact their own plans even as you play it you might find yourself lost as you interact with other tarnished and hunt down demigods in an attempt to become elden lord heck it not even especially clear most of the time what terms like elden lord and elden ring even meanwe been poring through elden ring lore for weeks now piecing together its vast and complicated backstory and the motivations of its many characters to get a sense of what happening in the game the story of your tarnished character is to fight through the world and try to gather great runes to become elden lordbut that simplified explanation belies the fact that you taking part in the war between various political factions and a bunch of nameless gods all of whom are vying to control the lands between the fate of reality itself in this place hangs in the balance and if you successful in your quest you can choose how to reshape the worldyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing elden ring lore trailerthere a lot of granularity to the story of elden ring but these are the broad strokes of what happening what happened before your arrival why you come to the lands between what you trying to accomplish and who trying to stop youmore deep dives into elden ring storythe frenzied flame and the game bleakest ending explainedlike the dark souls games and demon souls your relationship with dying is at the center of elden ringand actually it informs a lot of what happening in the world in the lands between a strange place beyond the fog the very structure of reality is dedicated by the will of its gods and demigods and one of most important things about the lands between is that marika who is both the land goddess and its queen altered reality to put an end to destined deaththe rule of nature that all things including the gods and demigods will pass awaythe gameplay loop of elden ring like the other soulsborne games sees you facing tough enemies and often dying while trying to fight them either because they stand in your way or because you trying to gain their powerand often both at the same time however because of the actions of queen marika and your role as a tarnished death is somewhat trivial you awaken at a nearby site of grace or stake of marika when you fall in battle enemies respawn when you rest at a site of grace for the same reason death is largely broken in the lands between and most everyone has been alive for a really long time it why you hear the howls at night of the many crucified characters scattered around limgrave why so many enemies look like zombie knights and why a few people seemingly wander around aimlessly or dig at the ground as if they lost their minds as in dark souls a lot of people seem like they been alive so long that their wits and intellect have failed themwhen people do die their souls generally return to the erdtree the big golden tree at the center of the world that both the primordial source of life and now the major component of the elden ring and the golden order there seems to be some kind of eternal life or resurrection possible through the erdtree although it not super clear what going on there the fact that souls physically return to the erdtree rather than ceasing to exist or being destroyed is why elden ring includes so many ghosts as well as gameplay elements like spirit ashthere are a lot of souls floating around returning to the erdtree is also why you enter so many catacombs dungeons that end with a boss room full of erdtree roots the proximity makes it easier for the souls to get where they goinginto this world come the tarnished a name for people who were once from the lands between but who were exiled long ago heavily implied to be descendants of godfrey ne hoarah loux the first elden lord who was expelled from the lands an age or more agothough the direct lineage and connections here are never made explicit after the events that are laid out in elden ring opening cinematic the tarnished who had died in the outside world were beckoned back to the lands between to compete to become elden lordthe fight to become elden lord your ostensible goal throughout the game seems strange at the outset of your journeya lot of people ask you or tell you that that what you trying to do but you basically just wake up in the lands between with no idea why you there that because the role of elden lord is extremely powerful and important with a lot of people and forces hoping to use that role or whoever earns it for their own ends and a lot of those ends have to do with how death works or doesn within the world a number of people want to change the role of death in the world of the lands between and they need the power of the elden ring and the elden lord in order to make that happento understand the whole deal of the elden lord you have to understand how reality in the lands between work and how it is ruled over by marika and her family who are both godlike beings and the equivalents of feudal kings queens and lordsfirst up there the elden ring a magical object that governs the rules of reality in the lands betweenit that gold thing on the title screen when you boot up the game the ring is made up of great runes that seemingly govern different elements of the world in removing the rune of death marika was able to change how death worked in her kingdom the elden ring isn native to the lands between though it was sent to the world by the greater will a cosmic force known as an outer godthe greater will exists somewhere far away from the lands between so to exert its uh will it has emissaries and agents marika is one of those agentsshe was originally of a people from outside the lands between called the numen emissaries of the greater will the two fingers chose marika to become an empyrean a person who could be elevated to godhood and serve as a vessel for the elden ring marika fulfilled that purpose and eventually became a god so at the top of the hierarchy is the greater will then marika and the elden ring then seemingly the two fingers then the demigods who are marika children and stepchildrenwhile marika had the power of the elden ring behind her she didn find the lands between empty in fact quite a few people lived there with civilizations and gods of their own they included giants in the mountains dragons who may have been subjects of the greater will before marika and humans as well as various other races scattered throughout the world with control of the elden ring and the rune of death marika established the golden order a sort of church of marika that also encompassed the rules of reality in the lands between and she started a campaign to bring the other civilizations to heel under her monarchy and the golden order for that she needed someone to wage war on her behalfa king to her queen essentially the role of consort to marika was known as the elden lord a person who would wield massive power in the lands between as marika right handfor her first elden lord marika chose a powerful warrior called hoarah loux in his new royal position he was renamed godfrey the golden under marika orders godfrey waged war on the giants and various other races when you get to the mountaintops of giants you find a whole lot of frozen giants there thanks to godfrey he also had children with marika godwyn the golden and the twins morgott and mohggodwyn was apparently marika most favored child in the end and he would go on to fight the dragons even befriending a few thanks to his prowess in battle morgott and mohg however were both omen childrenstrange powerful cursed beings with horns growing all over their bodies the golden order it seemed shunned the omens cutting off their horns at birth a procedure that usually killed them royal omen children weren treated quite so heinouslyinstead morgott and mohg were sent into to live in the jails and sewers beneath marika capital leyndellmeanwhile the campaigns of marika and godfrey were going pretty well and the influence of the greater will spread across the land among the armies they sent out into the world was a champion named radagon who advanced in the ranks and eventually stood as a major leader among leyndell forces he brought an army to bear against one of the countries of the lands between that wouldn come under the golden order purview liurnia of the lakes in liurnia stood the raya lucaria academy where sorcerers trained using powers derived from the cosmos at odds with the power of faith granted by the golden order the country had monarchs of its own the carian royal family and powerful knights who also wielded powers of sorceryradagon and his forces found they couldn defeat the carian soldiers or the sorcerers of liurnia and when he met the carian royal rennala on the battlefield the two fell in love so liurnia came under the golden order governance not through force like the other parts of the lands between but through a marriage alliance between radagon and rennala they had three children rykard radahn and rannieventually though godfrey ran out of people to conquer and for some reason marika decided to take away his title as elden lord she sent godfrey away along with his warriors to live outside the lands between it sounds like this was the origin of the tarnishedmarika intended for godfrey and his warriors to live struggle and die outside the lands between before returning stronger that whole deal is open to interpretation thoughmeanwhile after godfrey was pushed out radagon left rennalaa move that devastated herand returned to leyndell to become marika new consort the second elden lord because of the new marriage rykard radahn and ranni became marika stepchildren and were elevated to the status of demigodsradagon and marika then had two more demigod children together the twins miquella and malenia like morgott and mogh though these last two were also born cursed but in a different way miquella could never grow up forever trapped in the body of a child while malenia was cursed by the scarlet rot a disease that ate at her from the inside despite her immortalitystill despite various curses marika and her family lived and ruled for quite a long time this way raising a society in the lands between and governing as a powerful royal family but slowly things began to shiftmarika had taken over the lands between completely spreading the golden order just about everywhere she was extremely powerful thanks to the elden ring she had a powerful army of soldiers and clerics thanks to the golden order and she had control over the rune of death which meant she could deal death specifically to whoever she chose but she and her family and to some degree everyone in the lands between were otherwise effectively immortalin order to keep the rune of death safe marika entrusted it to maliketh her halfbrother the thing about maliketh is that he both a beastmanhalfwolf and halfpersonand marika shadow there more to the shadow situation but suffice to say that as her shadow maliketh served malika with unwavering loyalty she didn really treat him equally well thoughhis job was to safeguard the rune of death and pretty much nothing else which sounds like he was stuck locked away somewhere with this incredibly dangerous powerone night however someone managed to steal a piece of the rune of death from malekith combining it with some black daggers a group of assassins sneaked into the capital and killed godwyn many were captured or killed as they tried to escape but the damage was done for the first time in history a demigod had been killedthe next part of the timeline is a bit hazy because godwyn death did massive damage to marika and the golden order but it not exactly clear when everything happened as a result of the night of black knives at some point either immediately after godwyn death or some time later seemingly in a fit of grief marika used her hammer to shatter the elden ring that broke the ring up into a bunch of smaller runes some extremely powerful and some not and scattered them throughout the world radagon tried to repair the ring but couldn and marika soon disappeared again there might have been peace for a while but thanks to the destruction of the elden ring things were already falling aparteventually both marika and radagon were missing in action with the elden ring destroyed the golden order started to crumble and a power vacuum was created the various demigods got hold of pieces of the elden ring called great runes giving them even more power some wanted to restore the golden order some wanted to take power for themselves some wanted to change the rules of reality using the elden ring and some had other outer gods to whom they pledged their loyalty the demigods each trying to claim the role of elden lord for their own agendas plunged the entire lands between into a huge civil war called the shatteringthe lands between were quickly sectioned off into small territories each with their own armies there were clashes between several of the demigods culminating in a huge battle between the two greatest warriors among them radahn and malenia they fought on an expanse of sand dunes in caelid but neither could defeat the other though neither of the demigods was beaten their battle had enormous effects on the land thoughit spread malenia disease the scarlet rot all through caelid while decimating both groups of forces the scarlet rot is nasty stuff that has no cure with the ability to eat away at limbs and affect the functioning of the brain radahn was so badly infected with scarlet rot that he lost his mind malenia too was greatly harmed by the sickness she channeled the power of the rot within her in order to match radahn strength and in so doing lost a lot of her will and sense of self as she succumbed to the afflictionafter that massive battle the wars of the shattering died down somewhat but they left most of the lands between in ruins with the demigods unable to beat each other or unwilling to risk being beaten by one another they retreated to strongholds and fortresses with their great runeswhile several of the demigods are currently making their own moves the elden ringwhether they communing with other outer gods trying to grow their power or standing in defense of the old waysthere nobody to break the stalemate between them since no one can claim the elden ring to fix it and the golden order and take leadership in the lands between things are just stagnating in a state of semicivil war nobody dies nobody can win and everything ruinedand that where the tarnished come in called back to the lands between by some strange force they find themselves guided by gracea big golden light only they can see the grace seems to be subordinate to the two fingers and thus the greater will and it pushes tarnished toward hunting down the demigods and claiming their greater runes so they can repair the elden ring and become elden lord basically with the demigods unable to do the job it being outsourced to random warriors you meet so many tarnished in the game because you by no means the first to make this attempt and in fact many of the tarnished you meet have been at this for so long their ability to see grace has faded away you not only coming in at the end of marika long reign to find the lands between mostly in ruins you also coming in at the end of the institutions of the tarnished like the roundtable hold which are also languishingwhile your mission to eliminate the demigods and claim some of their great runes is at the center of elden ring there a whole lot of other stuff happening as well you find a ton of other characters scattered throughout elden ring each of whom is exercising their own plans a lot of people want to become elden lord including most of the tarnished and demigods you encounter some of them will try to use you to accomplish their goalsthe primary driver behind your quest is the two fingers the agent of the greater will usually information about the two fingers and their orders for you would come through a finger maiden these maidens are pledged to their tarnished guiding them to follow the wisdom of the two fingers and serve the greater will they also help you by channeling runes at sites of grace allowing you to increase your power when you start the game maidenless it means that for some reason you didn get a finger maidenand thus unable to increase your abilities you pretty much doomed luckily a strange woman named melina agrees to serve as your finger maiden provided you help her on her own questthe greater will wants you to mend the elden ring for its purposes but while lots of people are competing to become elden lord they don all want to do so because the greater will tells them to there a huge amount of conflict in the lands between because since the shattering the place is pretty much up for grabs the greater will has dominated for eons but other outer gods also exist and their followers are also vying for control a bunch of them are discussed throughout the game if you pursue information about them and their influences are all over the placetake for instance malenia and the scarlet rot once you venture into the areas of the game that concern the rot you learn that it related to a whole rot goddess complete with its own worshipers there also the frenzied flame another outer god that seems diametrically opposed to the greater order trying to enact an age of chaos on the lands between you find more mentions of more outer gods as you go and uncovering their purposes and agendas illuminates more of elden ring world there are also people who want to break free of the control of the outer gods altogetherthere also is a group of demigods known as empyreansthose chosen by the two fingers as candidates to ascend to full godhood just like marika did the rules for how empyreans work are unclear but we know that these characters are meant as potential candidates to serve as successors to marika once someone has been chosen as an empyrean they get a perfectly loyal wolf shadowmarika had maliketh in this role the empyreans we know about are the twin children of marika and radagon malenia and her brother miquella as well as ranni radagon daughter with rennala there also another empyrean we know almost nothing about a character referred to in the lore as the duskeyed queen so there are demigods who want to become elden lord teaming with marika and the golden order factions and cults who want to reshape the elden ring according to their own beliefs and empyreans who might want to become fullon gods themselves and replace marika altogetherthus making your way through the world of the lands between you going to run into a lot of different people who will tell you a lot of different things and integrally some are going to lie to you to get what they want others will try to kill you to take what you have everyone wants to become elden lord and claim the power that comes with it who you choose to help or hinder and what you choose to do with the power you gain along the way is up to youwhat you actually doing in elden ring can be just as confusing as the lore though to help you make sense of what happening check out our rundown of the story of elden ring as well as all the history and lore for each section starting

build whether you focused on dealing massive damage with powerful strikes or you prefer dualwielding quick blades they the focal point for any player trying to make their way through the lands between with as few deaths as possible but they aren all equal while the weapons players can use will depend on the points they put into each attribute they can always respec their points after defeating rennala queen of the full moonwhether players want a weapon for the long haul or simply want to try out different methods of combat we compiled a list of the top weapons in elden ring this list is categorized by weapon type with each category containing one or two weapons not every weapon category available in the game will be present thoughyou need a javascript enabled browser to watch videoswant us to remember this setting for all your devicessign up or sign in nowby clicking you agree to gamespot terms of use and privacy policyenternow playing elden ring accolades trailerwe also taken the point in elden ring when players can unlock these weapons into consideration as an example the sacred relic sword is a fantastic weapon but players can only unlock it after defeating the final boss players who don want to take on journey in new game plus won be able to make use of that weapon in elden ring the weapons on this list will be usable at some point before the final boss fightwhile this weapon was nerfed by the developers at from software it still possesses great power for strengthdexterity or intelligencearcane builds the reason why the sword of night and flame is so powerful is because of its preequipped ash of war nightandflame stance this ash can decimate enemies around the player in one fell swoop players are also receiving the benefit of dealing three types of damage with the straight sword in physical magic and fire the sword of night and flame power isn what it once was at the beginning of the game but it still worth it for players to try outplayers can find this straight sword in carian manor by going to the manor upper level site of grace and dropping down to a room on the ground floorthere are a couple of different katanas that should garner the attention of players while samurai players can wield the uchigatana for a solid portion of the game even those characters should swap it out for one of two choicesthis is the katana that swept through the community during the early stages of elden ring release players immediately discovered that the moonveil katana was arguably the most powerful bloodloss weapon in the game along with having the bloodloss passive effect the moonveil also features the devastating transient moonlight ash of war this ash shoots out a stream of light after players have completed a light or strong attack this light can then stagger enemies and break their poise with one hit the moonveil katana also deals both physical and magic damage making it a dualthreat for multiple buildsplayers can loot the moonveil by defeating the magma wyrm in caelid at gael tunnelwhile some players will stand by the hand of malenia as the next best katana we opted for the rivers of blood for a couple of reasons for starters the rivers of blood doesn have the high dexterity requirement that the hand of malenia has instead players only need strength dexterity and arcane moreover the rivers of blood has arguably the better overall scaling and preequipped ash of war in corpse piler this ash inflicts massive blood loss onto enemies and deals a solid amount of damage in the processplayers need to defeat bloody finger okina at the church of repose in the mountaintops of the giants to unlock the rivers of bloodwhile there is one clearcut best greatsword in elden ring we be including two in case players builds don match the necessary requirements for the bestinclass weaponanother famous elden ring weapon the dark moon greatsword is arguably the best intelligence weapon in the lands between players might think a staff would hold that title but the dark moon greatsword can deal a massive amount of magic damage this is mostly thanks to the intelligence scaling featured on the sword the dark moon greatsword features one of the best ashes of war moonlight greatsword which buffs magic attack power and coats the sword in frost to deal damage once players hit an enemy with a charged attack this particular greatsword requires intelligence to use though so some players might need to respec in order to use itplayers can loot the dark moon greatsword after completing ranni questlinethe blasphemous blade is nowhere near as powerful as the dark moon greatsword but also doesn feature the stat requirements of that weapon players only need strength dexterity and faith to wield this blade this greatsword deals additional fire damage while also healing the player of max hp plus an additional hp upon every enemy death the blade ash of war taker flames increases this healing buff in addition to dealing fire damageplayers can unlock the blasphemous blade through finger reader enia after defeating rykard lord of blasphemy and claiming his remembrancethere are a few curved greatswords that players can use to great effect in elden ring but we going with one in particular that can carry players through the entire gamebloodhound fang is arguably the best earlygame weapon in all of elden ring players can loot it within a few hours of playing assuming they skilled enough and it has the ability to be the weapon players are holding when they defeat the final boss it scales marvelously with strength and dexterity and also doesn feature any ridiculous stat requirements if players scale correctly they can exceed damage with each hit from the fang not to mention the sword ash of war bloodhound finesse lets players strike twice while moving swiftly around an enemy the bloodhound fang is the choice for the best curved greatsword due to its low requirements unlock point and overall scalingplayers can unlock the bloodhound fang by defeating bloodhound knight darriwil at the forlorn hound evergaol in limgravethere are two choices for the best colossal sword in elden ring and players can really go wrong with either of themthe grafted blade greatsword is a hugely powerful strengthbuild weapon that comes with a high stat requirement of however if players manage to get there they will have the ability to demolish enemies in one to two hits this colossal sword has high physical damage that scales great with strength and a devastating ash of war oath of vengeance this ash boosts all of the player attributes for seconds in addition to increasing poise for tough boss battles there arguably not a better weapon to use if players have points in strengthplayers can loot the grafted blade greatsword after defeating leonine misbegotten at castle morne in weeping peninsulain elden ring players can acquire two colossal swords by defeating the demigods starscourge radahn and maliketh the black blade while maliketh blade is certainly worth a spot on this list we going with the starscourge greatsword due to its earlier unlock point in elden ring the stats on the weapons aren different enough to warrant players waiting until they defeat malikeththe starscourge greatsword deals a solid amount of physical damage while also adding in magic damage it can also be dualwielded which gives players an additional moveset and more damage with each swing the ash of war starcaller cry is fantastic at clearing out enemies players can use starcaller cry once to suck enemies in and then again to pound both swords into the ground and send out a gravity explosionwe feel there one colossal weapon in elden ring that outmatches its counterparts which is viewable below however an honorable mention will go to the ghiza wheel for its incredible ash of war which lets players use it like a lawnmower to tear up enemiesthe fallingstar beast jaw is the only colossal weapon in elden ring to feature more than just physical damage this sword also deals magic damage but doesn require a high intelligence stat to wield of course it does require high strength to use but that shouldn be an issue for strengthfocused builds the fallingstar beast jaw scales with both strength and dexterity and features a terrific ash of war gravity bolt this ash sees players send a bolt of lightning down onto enemies dealing physical magic and poise damageplayers can unlock this weapon by defeating the fullgrown fallingstar beast in mt gelmiranother earlygame weapon in elden ring reduvia is the clearcut best dagger players can wield in the lands between dexterity builds will be hardpressed to find a weapon that scales better with the attribute reduvia also has the bloodloss passive effect along with a great ash of war reduvia blood blood this ash gives players the ability to slash at enemies from a farther distance and can be used in rapid successionplayers can unlock reduvia by defeating bloody finger nerijus near the murkwater catacombs in limgravealthough the bow isn the most viable option there are still some solid weapons players can choose from if they going a ranged buildthe pulley bow is perhaps the best wellrounded bow in elden ring it deals decent physical damage for a standard bow and has the best range out of any bow in the game its level requirements are next to nothing scaling with both strength and dexterity players can use its ash of war mighty shot to inflict more damage onto enemies from a farther distance while it not the most interesting choice in the bowcrossbow category it arguably the top choiceplayers can unlock the pulley bow by going to the top of a siege tower around the mt gelmir campsite north of gelmir hero cavethere aren many axes available in elden ring but players found early on that the icerind hatchet was among the best weapons to use while the developers eventually nerfed the icerind axe it still viable in midapril what makes the icerind hatchet so powerful is its ash of war hoarfrost stomp this was a speedrunner dream utility as it allowed them and any other player to completely stop enemies from attacking once used players will stomp the ground staggering enemies with ice damage and eliminating chunks of hp the hatchet also deals passive frost damage as wellplayers can find the icerind axe in temple quarter of liurnia of the lakes inside of a ruined building chestthe last weapon category on this list is for mages only there are dozens of staffs in elden ring but one separates itself from the rest of the packeasily the best choice for sorcerers the meteorite staff has ridiculous scaling and overall stats it has an s scale rating for intelligence while boosting the power of gravity sorceries by this makes spells like rock sling and meteorite of astel even stronger than they already are to make the case for the meteorite staff stronger players can find it extremely early and equip any ash of war they want on it the only issue with the staff is that it can be upgraded so players might have to eventually find another staff to replace it like the one showcased belowplayers can loot the meteorite staff at street of sage ruins near sellia crystal tunnel in caelidif players want to grow out of the meteorite staff then they need to use the carian regal scepter this staff has the highest intelligence requirement of any staff but can deal massive damage and scales nicely with intelligence and sorcery while lusat glintstone staff does deal more damage the carian regal scepter comes with the spinning weapon ash of war which lets players spin the staff in front of them to deal with oncoming enemies this deals magic damage based on the player intelligencesorcery full moon sorceries will also get boosted by using the scepterplayers can acquire the carian regal scepter by defeating rennala queen of the full moon and trading in her

gamespot,2022/05/04,https://www.gamespot.com/articles/minecraft-java-vs-bedrock-which-version-is-best-for-playing-mojangs-game/1100-6502838/,you can play minecraft just about anywherepc consoles and mobile devices all run mojang seemingly immortal game but the truth is that despite being on a dozen platforms there are really just two versions bedrock and java if you looking to get into minecraft you see people talking about these two versions but what is the differenceand which one is bestwhen minecraft just started to become popular in the early there was just one platform and one version minecraft was built in java and played on windows and linux bedrock meanwhile began its life as minecraft pocket edition a version meant to run well on mobile devices but would eventually form the base for bedrock editionbedrock edition exists for a few reasons one is that java has tons of security vulnerabilities a major vulnerability affected minecraft java edition as recently as december in which the vulnerability allowed users to execute code on a minecraft server just by entering text into the game chatbox if you putting your game onto every console in existence you probably don want to accidentally make them all hackableas much as console modders would love thatjava is also not terribly well optimized for games like minecraft and wouldn have run well on the first round of consoles it released on which includes the xbox and playstation bedrock is a complete rebuild of minecraft that both takes care of that security issue and lets microsoft better optimize the game for modern game console hardwarethere are a number of differences between java and bedrock editions of minecraft including little mechanical differencesminecraft on java has more combat moves and some mobs and items have different variablesthough microsoft has made an effort in recent years to ensure that minecraft bedrock and java editions are getting closer and closer together rather than further apartif you playing on a console or mobile devicean xbox playstation switch or androidios device you be playing bedrock if you one of the few and proud that plays on a linux device you going to be playing java so we assume those players already know what they want and focus on the rest of us playing on windows and pcsso all of your friends play minecraft but some of them play on pc others play on xbox and some are even playing on their mobile devices there are a couple of options for crossplay with minecraft bedrock you can hook up with them whenever you like for a singlesession multiplayer gameyou can join your friend game but only while they also playingstored on the host user device if you use an official minecraft realm though you can have an alwaysonline alwaysaccessible server provided by microsoft for a small monthly fee anyone on bedrock edition that you invitethat includes players on xbox one series s and series x nintendo switch playstation and android ios and windows and join a realm and get building whenever they wantas a side note if you planning to build your own server or pay another provider with more flexible server options you need to stick with pc or take your chances with dicey hacks to get other versions working with servers as only windows devices support connecting to custom servers in bedrock editionyou not one to just leave a game the way it was installed you want to make it your own that doesn mean just skins and texture packs but total overhaul mods that introduce new game mechanics shader packs and more if that sounds like you you want to play java editionthe older your computer is the more leeway you need to give it with games minecraft is anything but new but bedrock tends to run better on older systems due to java generally poor optimization of course java will most likely run finebut bedrock edition will give you a little more elbow room generally speaking if you want the most stable performance the general consensus in the minecraft community seems to be that bedrock offers a smoother more stable experience over javaregardless of whether your pc qualifies as a potato or cuttingedge technologyif you want the most advanced graphical effects and prefer they be of the officially supported variety minecraft bedrock edition offers full integration with nvidia ray tracing and upscaling features ray tracing allows you to enjoy all kinds of light effects that completely change the way the game looks while nvidia dlss upscaling helps keep the game running smoothly by playing at a lower resolution and then using aideep learning to make the game look like it running at that native resolution minecraft java edition does offer shader packs and other mods that can change the way the game looks but bedrock is where the official support lies at this time you must be running an nvidia rtx card of some kindthe newer the betterwhile bedrock edition is the lead platform for microsoft and mojang java edition is still under active development and due most likely to it having a smaller player base remember pc only that generally more tolerant of changes java will often get upcoming and experimental features

recently picked up an xbox series xs you may find it hard to adjust to gaming with a traditional xbox controller in that case it might make sense to game with a keyboard and mouse microsoft introduced the functionality during the xbox one generation it especially useful if you used to playing competitive multiplayer games with keyboard and mouse controls or hey maybe you a console gamer who has heard people rave about the precision and accuracy that possible with a mouse and keyboard setup and want to check it out for yourself we rounded up the best xbox keyboard and mouse options available nowbefore that you need to understand some of the limitations that come with mouse and keyboard support on xbox consoles firstly while the console might support it at a base level each game still needs to individually support it too in order to work this is especially true in competitive multiplayer titles where a mouse and keyboard can constitute a big advantage many of these games such as fortnite and call of duty warzone get around this by separating players depending on their input scheme rather than by the platform they playing on so just keep in mind that even though you playing on a console you likely be matched up with more pc players in most caseslike pc you also have the option to use either wired or wireless keyboard and mice although unlike the playstation you won be able to use them via bluetooth the xbox series x and s only communicate to wireless devices using dongles or xbox own wireless signal for controllersheadsets and even then it restricted to certain peripherals that have support thankfully there are some options that have been specifically designed with the xbox in mind meaning you won need to worry about compatibility out of the boxwhen it comes to great options for keyboard and mouse input on xbox you have just as many options as you do on playstation again you don have to purchase peripherals specifically designed for console many great wireless keyboard and mice that work on pc will do the trick which becomes especially important if you play your consoles at the same desk as your pc we rounded up the best choices on the market currently including good combo deals comfortable solutions for couch play and just great bang for your buck options that will get the job donefor more xbox suggestions check out our roundups of the best xbox series x controllers best xbox headsets and best xbox accessories and if you game on playstation as well we also put together a list of the best mouse and keyboard options for and most expensive option on this list is arguably also one of the best if you looking for an uncompromising keyboard and mouse experience on console the xbox turret was made specifically for xbox consoles ensuring compatibility out of the box it a lap setup that includes a tenkeyless mechanical keyboard and wireless mouse with a profile like the popular razer deathadder the mouse pad is retractable and magnetic making storage and use equally simple the whole setup connects to your console with a single dongle which is a nice little extra it expensive but you struggle to find betterif the razer turret is a bit more than you willing to spend corsair has a drastically cheaper option that might already gel with your existing setup the corsair is a fantastic mechanical keyboard featuring cherry mx red linear switches and backlighting only a single color unfortunately it also seamlessly clips into corsair lapboard with the pair of them retailing for the lapboard is just alone if you already own a you need to supply your own mouse which might then need an additional wireless dongle attached to your xbox but it a great alternative and especially affordable if you happen to already own a you have no keyboard or mouse options for use with your console then it likely that a good bundle might serve you better than trying to buy everything piecemeal the razer power up bundle exists for that reason combining a keyboard mouse and wired headset into one affordable package to get you gaming in no time it features the razer cynosa lite keyboard which is a fantastic membrane keyboard with razer familiar stylings the ambidextrous viper gaming mouse and kraken x lite gaming headset all the peripherals are wired so they best suited for a desk setup but at this price you struggle to find a better allinone dealmoving away from lapboards but sticking to wireless options the logitech lightspeed might be the best option for a keyboard that doesn require a pc to unlock its best features the lightspeed dongle ensures a strong fast connection to the keyboard which features logitech romerg mechanical switches think cherry mx browns but a little squishier what more the battery is rated to last an entire year which is certainly helped by the lack of any energysucking backlighting you be hardpressed to find another keyboard as easy to use with the xbox than thiswhen it comes to using a mechanical keyboard with consoles you must make the concession that many of the features one might ship with won be available unless connected to a pc that isn the case with the hyperx alloy origins core which features onboard memory that allows you to swap between three rgb backlighting profiles without the need for proprietary software at least once you set it up it also just a strikingly affordable mechanical keyboard with a tenkeyless layout and hyperx own aqua tactile switches which are a dream to use there regular blue and red switches too this is a great keyboard for most gaming pcs and one of the best for consolelogitech make some of the best mice for gaming which gives you many options to sift through when trying to make a good choice often the classics are hard to better however which is why the gaming mouse is likely going to be one of the better gaming mice options out there for use with xbox it wired unless you make the jump to the lightspeed but its design is so beautifully ergonomic that your wrists will thank you for the investment it features onboard rgb lighting too which can be customized on a pc as well as a range of dpi settings that can be toggled on the mouse itself it a mouse that you likely use for years to come if you treat it wellit doesn get as classic as the deathadder when it comes to iconic gaming mice so razer didn really shake up the formula too much when designing the deathadder you get the same familiar ergonomic sculpt that feels great in your hand along with single color lighting new mechanical switches and a faster sensor for the best tracking experience the also ships with razer speedflex cable which makes it feel almost wireless which works well in today age of increasingly lighter micethe couchmaster cycon isn a keyboard or mouse but rather a fantastic hub for you to add both peripherals to featuring a wireless connection with your console the cycon lets you connect whatever keyboard and mouse you want to it

it also boasts an excellent autofocus that adjusts quickly to bring its subject into focus i been particularly impressed when showing my audience a closeup look at a figure or drink the streamcam also has autoexposure though you still need a good lighting setup to get the bestlooking pictureone particularly neat feature is that ability to flip this webcam from a format to a one this works best if you want to stream to facebook or instagram or you want to use that format for your pip on twitch andor youtube it connects to your pc via usbc which provides a stronger faster connectionof course you need to make sure your pc has a usbc port or you need a usbc to usb adapterthe logitech pro webcam is a surprisingly great device while using it i didn even need a light in a dimly lit room at pm it provided a clear and bright image that trounced all of the webcams on this list the colours looked much more accurate and bright as opposed to the darker higher contrast image of the logitech streamcam when comparing the two webcams without a light there no doubt that a light improved the look of the pro feed but it definitely not needed for a great visual of your facethe pro webcam is capable of recording at up to and fps and streaming up to and fps the one problem i found was that logitech capture software did not allow me to record or even view the webcam feed in there was also a lot of visual noise in the background of the image thankfully this wasn the case in streamlabs obs which provided me with a clean smooth imagethe razer kiyo is a fps webcam that is perfect for streaming one thing about its lower resolution that you have to remember is that the pip of your face is going to be much smaller than the rest of your stream feed that means it will still look great even if you streaming at and beyond where the razer kiyo picks up that slack however is having a builtin ring light which lights up your face and ensures a great looking picturerazer has also supported its kiyo webcam with software and firmware updates bringing new features and customization razer synapse software lets you adjust focus brightness contrast and more as well as save profiles

white balancing among other thingslogitech series are alltime greats when it comes to webcams and the is an excellent choice for streaming it can capture and fps or and fps and features excellent autofocus and lighting correction that means this webcam performs well in dim conditions though you still want to get an extra light to make your webcam feed look as best it canthe logitech capture software helps you customize your feed including exposure frame rate and scene effects including negative colours and a fisheye effect that provides goofy warped faces it a great piece of software that makes it easy to tweak different settings with your webcam the logitech webcam also comes with a free three months of xsplit premium which gives you everything you need to set up a stream and broadcast to twitch and youtubethere are some great webcams out there but if you want the absolute best quality image of your face on stream then you going to want to upgrade to a dslr camera the

back in destiny pitting players against one another in a friendly competition to see which of the three character classes will reign supreme whether the bragging rights interest you or not you want to pick up the guardian games new submachine gun the title this slick little gun carries some of the best perks in the class along with a new origin trait just for the guardian games called classy contenderif you lean into the guardian games you likely get multiple rolls of the title but your first chance at the gun will require you to finish the event opening quest best in class it not especially difficult but it is something you want to knock out quickly in order to start messing around with your new gun and to fully open up your guardian games options here how to knock out the quest quickly and claim the titleyour quest starts in the tower with eva levante the event vendor who shows up in the center of the courtyard to start you want to claim your guardian games class item which you get for free after that pick a contender card from eva you going to need to complete a playlist activity like a strike or gambit match so pick the card that lines up with whatever you want to do nextyou should only need to complete one activity so all options are equalwhen you get into your activity you want to earn earn laurels one of the main currencies of the guardian games laurels drop while you wearing your guardian games class item whenever you kill strong enemiesanything with an orange health bar or yellow health baror when you take out enemies with your abilities you can earn laurels anywhere so long as you wearing your guardian games class item this step also requires you to earn a medallion but if you killing enemies with a mind toward getting laurels you should earn one along the way we completed this step in a single strikeafter you knocked out your activity and earned a few laurels you return to the tower to deposit your medallion in the big podium in the center of the courtyard return to eva and she give you another item the medallion case which tracks the medallions you earn and the laurels you carrying at any given timehead next to zavala and he introduce you to a few new elements of the guardian games first are vanguard medals which are like triumphs you receive for doing things in the guardian games playlist medals unlock for all sorts of reasons like killing three enemies with melees in rapid succession gaining killstreaks with specific weapons using your abilities and more there are also three new guardian games playlists for you to access from the tower courtyard screen in the director the recreational playlist is a little easier and more casual while the training and competitive playlists are a bit more serious jump into the recreational playlist and grab any vanguard medal in order to proceed on the best in class quest you get one for basically anything you do but a quick and easy way to earn one is to quickly melee three weak enemiesreturn to the tower after knocking out a recreational playlist activity and you can wrap up the quest speak with zavala first who will give you a new item for tracking your scores and then head to eva to get your first copy of the titlethe title is a significant smg because it has a high rate of fire and solid range that makes it similar to other great smgs like funnelweb a current favorite what might put the title ahead of other competitors is its new origin trait classy competitor with this equipped you earn class ability energy with every kill the gun also fires void ammo which means you can synergize it with new void aspects and fragments which allows the gun to fire volatile roundsthe first copy of the title you get comes with demolitionist and vorpal weapon for its perks but bungie noted in its recent this week at bungie blog post that you can earn various rolls of the gun as well as masterworked version with double perks in the third and fourth slots from what we can tell however the title doesn drop just from guardian games activitiesat least not in the recreational and training playlists it seems very likely that if you want additional rolls of the title you need to earn light the bronze silver gold and platinum torches in the game and earn their rewardslighting the torches is part of the guardian games medallion battalion quest you can pick up from eva it tracks your progress in depositing medallions for your class in the podium in the tower awarding points based on the rarity of the medallions you dropping inthe highest points are for platinum medallions while bronze awards the lowest deposit enough medals and you unlock the ability to light a torch behind the medallion podium in the tower which unlocks a reward for the week after unlocking the bronze torch our rewards hasn unlocked yet suggesting you need to wait until the weekly reset to actually reap these rewards you can light up to eight torches in a weektwo each for bronze silver gold and platinum levelswith corresponding rewards for each torchso although we unsure of exactly what you earn from these torchlightings it seems that better versions of the title are very likely to drop here we also waiting to see what potential rewards will come from the guardian games competitive playlist which is only accessible during the weekends the idea is to play the training playlist during the week to unlock special buffs for your character and then play the competitive playlist over the weekend to unlock better rewards and earn more medallions for your class we
