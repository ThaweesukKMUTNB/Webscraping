gdcadding hours of playtime to the original game young horses announced players would receive their own ingame dwelling to renovate now you can feel like part of the grumpus community the hut begins as a glorified pile of sticks but by completing requests from fellow villagers players gain access to options for furniture paint decorative items and even an upstairs many of these received objects reflect the giver the exerciseobsessed chandlo may offer players a weightlifting trophy while snaxburgs mayor filbo might gift an adorable stuffed grumpusnew players are shown to their new abode right after entering snaxburg for the first time however returning players get a tour of their shack upon talking to filbo and find their mailboxes already stuffed with retroactive rewards for any requests theyve unwittingly completed the developers at young horses explain the pile of new tasks and objectives should give players a good reason to continue exploring snaktooth island and engaging with its inhabitantskeeping this goal in mind young horses latest expansion will also introduce hats for your favorite scrumptious snax did you ever wonder what happened to the head adornments of your grumpus companions after they take on a bugsnax form well it looks like the islands tasty residents got them and its up to you to track them down more than just a simple and silly cosmetic feature players

witchs hat and chandlos snax baseball cap the developers hope this gives players a fun challenge that makes revisiting previous locations worthwhilei got a chance to go handson with the upcoming dlc and from what ive played so far the expansion will be another merry romp through a strange world the isle of bigsnax gives players more and bigger bugsnax content that builds on the original experience and a chance to dive deeper into the relationships and story from the base gamethe demo begins just before the point of no return in the initial story and sets me on a beach with the musclebound chandlo scientific floofty bonecarrying archeologist triffany and spiritual shelda the titular island has appeared in the middle of the ocean and having made it to the beach we are now out of range from the rest of the villagers the experience boasts numerous puzzles and most are built around my arsenal of unusual gadgets the first puzzle asks me to bridge a gap by lighting a torch in another instance i discovered several mazes with moving pillars and winding corridors too small for any grumpus to fit into however it was perfectly sized for my ballbound strabby which i guided through the obstacles to hit a dooropening switchplayers can also look forward to several largerthanlife bugsnax encounters my first new sighting a giant bunger sends chandlo flying into a pile of jars that just happen to contain dust that makes bigsnax smaller but even slimmed down the creature still needs to be stunned to catch so i grab the tripwire and then feed my prize to the weakened chandlo giving him the strength to go onthe team then sets up camp and the story begins to take shape this archeological adventure may uproot accepted beliefs about mother naturae who shelda worships as the jars of bugsnaxcatching dust was found at her shrine at the camp i have a choice between four different quests however im instructed to follow triffanys storyline for this preview she has mework my snaxguiding magic to open a few blockedoff areas this includes one puzzle that triggers a boulderlike bigsnax to pop out at us a nice indiana jones reference that highlights the games humorous tonei encounter plenty more bigsnax in my short adventure though i dont have any handy shrink dust to capture them each enlarged snax takes on an entertaining form like a sentient celery stick that carries separate chocolatelooking critters on its back i saw lobster made from macaroni noodles that loved cheese and one of my favorite new snax was called a millimochi made of a group of frosty treats lined up to create a multisnack creaturethe isle of bigsnax is aiming to come out april including the hut hats and fresh adventure the new content is about percent as big as the original game according to the developers so if it took you hours to finish the base experience it may take around hours to explore everything the supersized expansion has to offer,en,447.0,Positive

Hokoyama On Winning Awards, Writing Video Game Music, And More",wataru hokoyama has been composing and orchestrating scores for tv shows films and video games for decades thanks to the music he created for ratchet clank rift apart alongside his mentor of six years mark mothersbaugh hes now an official american society of composers authors and publishers awards winnerthats because hokoyama has received the video game score of the year award for rift apart by way of the ascap screen music awards of course mothersbaugh helped create the score as well but hes not with ascap so the award on paper goes to hokoyama alone in a new interview with game informer though the composer who also has credits on thor ragnarok resident evil knack halo wars and halo anniversary and more said winning this award wouldnt have been possible without mothersbaugh thats because mothersbaugh is the reason hokoyama got the opportunity to score rift apart in the first placewe worked on it for about a year and a half but i want to mention something thats super important before i talk about anything else and that is that this project actually originally came to me by my mentor mark mothersbaugh says hokoyama i have been working with mark for the last several years at least six and hes been my mentor so when sony offered ratchet clank rift apart to mark he brought me on board as a cowriter which is extremely big and kind of him because it is such a huge title he brought me on board as a cowriter to share credit with me and to work with me on this which was an extreme honor i just want to show my appreciation for markhokoyama and mothersbaugh worked together on thor ragnarok but obviously they had the score finished before then he says in shortly after finishing up on ragnarok the rift apart opportunity landed on their plate in hokoyamas heart todays award goes to both of themim glad im getting all these awards and attention now compared to years ago because im more mature i dont get ungrounded or jump off the chair or get a big head or the wrong idea about myself hokoyama says i feel very calm and just this sense of wow so grateful that the world actually sees this as a special soundtrack that weve worked on for so long i just feel calmly gratefulthroughout the interview hokoyama stressed how thankful he was to work with sony he says they gave him mothersbaugh and the rest of the music team full creative freedom to create the best score possible for rift apartthe team at sony is really awesome hokoyama says theyre super easy to work with and very very collaborative and creative and they just supported us in any level possible i think it made the whole creative team really fun and it allowed us to kind of do wilder thingshokoyama says that creative freedom remained throughout the entire process even as pressure andhypearound rift apart which was one of the first major firstparty exclusives for the playstation that launched less than a year prior continued to build when asked about the pressure of composing a score for such a big title hokoyama says it felt less like pressure and more like excitementi knew the name ratchet clank because i used to play it and i was so into it he says when i heard the name i was like oh my goodness of course i did feel the pressure but we were all excited rather than pressure it was like oh my god we get to do this big title they just basically said hey i want you guys to be very creative and any idea that comes to your mind wed love to hear it that allowed us to extend our creativity and i really believe that it was a whole team effortthat led to this scoreratchet clank is one of playstations longestrunning franchises and when asked how the score of rift apart played into that legacy hokoyama explained that because the last new entry in the franchise was into the nexus since ratchet clank was essentially a remake with an existing score written for it he and mothersbaugh were able to create a new sound for the series he said sony specifically encouraged them to create something new they wanted to hear what would come out of us he saysas a result hokoyama and mothersbaugh didnt have to find ways to include old themes everything created was new however the duo was aware of the legacy behind ratchet clank and the history fans draw on when playing the games so they made sure to honor the previous sounds of the series toothe premise of rift apart which tasks ratchet and the new alternatedimension lombax rivet with fighting across multiple dimensions to stop emperor nefarious gave hokoyama and mothersbaugh plenty of space to write creatively too on the one hand rivet gave them a new musical canvas to play with as she would need her own defining theme and score on the other hand because both ratchet and rivet jump from dimension to dimension throughout the game the protagonists always visit a new planet and a new world means a new trackits sort of like a multiverse of one world says hokoyama so we kept that in mind and we would use a lot of electronic music to create the feel of rivets worlds versus the original ratchet world i think that helped us sort of not divide but create dimensionshokoyama says sony helped the musical duo too guiding them by keying them into what the next level or planet would be like so that they could write to its mission aesthetic and morewhen we looked at the big mapwe saw all the planets of this world and the first impression was oh my god thats a lot at the same time sonys idea with the game was to have different characteristics on different planets and while this is a multiverse it needed to remain cohesive at the same time there was a cohesion in energy but the sound and color had to be different so we kept that in mind as we proceeded it actually gave us a lot of freedom to sort of search for new tools and writing styles we used different types of instrumentation sometimes orchestra heavy or electronic heavy to create the feel of each planetone example of the collaboration between hokoyamas creativity and sonys freedom can be found in yardolis the games piratethemed level in the back half of the game in talking about pirate music and the way audiences can hear a song and go that sounds piratey he said originally they went too heavy on the pirateness of the planets score with sony suggesting it could be toned down thats where more of its electronic sound came through they are space pirates after all its also how instruments like broken accordions get used these pirates likely dont have a fullyoperational accordion so why would the music feature one the score needed to reflect the world and thats why the planets score contains broken accordion noisesspeaking more broadly about video game music hokoyama says games present their own unique challenge in composing a score one player might blaze through an area in just a few minutes another player might take minutes but both should feel equally impacted by the score at the right times hokoyamas composition needed to be able to handle both types of playersthe biggest difference between games and movies or tv would be placing the gameplay he says the players listen to our music so much longer than they would in a scene for a movie you only seeand hearit once in a movie but for video games sometimes they stay in there for hours so we have that in mindsomething thats easy to listen to and get into without even thinking is key according to hokoyama on that same note players are going to be listening to this music longer than they would the score in a tv series or movie so it needs to be fun and enjoyable enough that they dont mind listening to it for so longhokoyama is the winner of the video game score of the year award for the ascap composers choice awards itself a part of the overall ascap screen music awards which is a special honor because its an award decided on by fellow ascap members this means hokoyama was chosen by fellow

Changes To Talents And Professions,this week blizzard announced world of warcraft newest expansiondragonflightshowing off the new race and class combination the dracthyr evoker as well as the new lands players will be exploring in the longhidden dragon isles some of the reveals this weekweren as flashy as playabletransforming magical dragons yet they doprovide a better windowintothe philosophy and prioritiesof the world of warcraft team in the immediate future i spoke withdragonflightsenior game designer jackie wiley about thecomplete talents system rework coming to all classes in as well as the big changes coming to professionswe stepping away from borrowed power this expansion to work on our evergreen systems but also letting players express themselves how they want says wileythe concept of borrowed power comes up often in the warcraft community which references systems like legion artifact weapons azerite armor from battle for azeroth and thecovenant abilities and soul binds from shadowlands which all gave players new stat boostsspells andskills not inherent to the core class progression and talents system at the start of recentexpansions large swaths of your character werewiped away leaving significant holes in classrotations andutilities left to be filled by whatever the next borrowed power mechanic would be in the newexpansion according to wiley statement dragonflight won have a system like that with blizzard instead opting instead to learn from those borrowed power systems to rebuild a more classic take ontalentscurrently wow players gain a majority of their spells and abilities automatically when they level up with only a handful of choices given to them regarding their preferred playstyle for their class specialization every levels or so you can choose one of three talents from a specific tier some offer modifications to existing abilities while others grant new skills altogether however with only six real choices to make per character at a given time there not a lot in the way of player expression and customization for a given class that all changes in dragonflighttalent trees are coming back to world of warcraft in a big way giving players a chance to pour precious talent points into their chosen skill uponevery level up the earliestiterations of the wow talent system provided a tree for each specialization in which players could spread their points across all available trees enhancing specific class abilities dragonflight however will have two trees onefor the overall class utility and identityand another for that character chosen specialization you won be able to necessarilybuild a mage into a frostfire hybrid spellcaster but the new system should offer much greater granularity in how players want to minmax their talents and customize how their character playsevery levelup players will earn either a class talent point or a specialization talent point which can be spent to activate talents on that particular tree the concept isn new but it is a refreshing return to form and a big step closer to what players like me craved in the leadupto world of warcraft classic having that choiceeach level that tiny reward and semblance that i building my character in theory makes the leveling experience more fulfilling and less like a chore while powering through old content to get to the current expansion zonesit not just the old ways of doing talents for the sake of changewe taken a lot of lessons from all of the systemswe had the past few expansions that are dear to our hearts like azeritearmor conduits soul binds legendaries andtaking inspiration from thosesays wiley so you might see a few friendly things that you remember speckled dispersed throughout your talent treesthose friendly things being variouscovenant abilities possibly becoming a permanent fixture for a class though nothing specific is being promised an example given was druid full moon spell making its way from a legion artifact weapon power to joining the active roster of spells for that classfor example after legionbalancedruidswerelike still want to drop a moon on things though and so luckily they can still drop amoon on things explains wiley it really takinginspiration from those changeswe want to make the class but also juststuff thatplayers love or even some players love that we want to give them the option for againit should be noted that the addition of these fleshedout talent trees will not representcomplete reworks of each class central identity wiley describes we not looking to overhaul classesspecsrotations like we did in legion if you like how your spec plays today we want you to be able to largely recreate that in but with more customization via talentslike talents the professions of world of warcraft are getting somewhat of anoverhaul the details haven all been revealed quite yet but big changes are coming to crafting and gathering and their importance to the player fantasy and economy within the game crafting professions like blacksmithing or leatherworking will have their own specialization tracks that will have players focus on a particular aspect of that trade for instance blacksmiths can once again choose to prioritize weaponsmithing or armorsmithing and become renowned on that player server for being the best swordsmith around not all crafted items will be the same mind you with a new crafting quality rating being added showing off that your character used better materials orspecialization in making that particularitemgear will also be availableto accentuate these trade skillsand will automaticallybe equippedwhen performing your trade such as picking herbs or sewing some new cloth armorfinally new crafting orders will allow players to commission specific items to be made from various crafters even those that are soulbound on pick up which makes previously nontransferable professionspecific items available to anyone who can use them those who want to submit a crafting order will open an auction housestyle window ingame and choose the item they would like made and sent to them they can contribute some or all of the required materials to craft the item and whatever fee the contractor will ask for to complete the job players can shop around for different offers and choose which crafter they want to work with crafters on the other hand can make a name for themselves through crafting orders by providingreasonable ratesthe quality of their crafted items or even throwing in some extra goodies to their customerswith the release of dragonflight the entire professions system could receive a new lease on life if these ideas pan out as they been presented so far i never been more interested in participating in the wow economy and hope that crafting and gathering become a meaningful way of interacting with players rather than cold auction transactions as they are now these profession changes partnered with the complete talent rework are substantial changes to the foundation of world of warcraft and could make for a much better experience for the game player base moving forward,en,468.0,Positive

Access To Develop Its First-Person, Post-Apocalyptic Survival Game",forever skies is far from homes firstperson survival game set on a decrepit procedurallygenerated earth abandoned to waste away in ruin and its coming to early access on pc this year players will leave the safe orbit where other humans await salvation and begin exploring an earth covered in a thick layer of toxic dust following an ecological disaster in hopes of learning more about its demise and uncovering secrets that could save the human race the reveal trailer gets straight to the point humans messed earth up and failed to do what was needed to save it sound familiargame informer spoke with far from home ceo and gameplay lead andrzej blumenfeld and brand manager pawel jawor about this premise how it hits close to home how it affects gameplay and what players can expect out of forever skies early access lifecyclewhile the idea of ecological disaster ruining earth hits close to home for anyone looking at the health of this planet today the premise was directly inspired by the studios home country of polandthere weredifferent pillars in coming up with forever skies and one of them was that we are living in poland and for a very long time weve seen whats going on around us blumenfeld tells game informer sometimes we hear that warsaw or krakw for example are very polluted cities like the most polluted cities in the world and now sometimes we receive messages on the phone that say if you can just please stay at home because going outside is dangerous the air is like poisonand this was one of the many things that we were like yeah maybe this is a good topic to speak aboutjawor added that the team had a revelatory moment after a local scientist said that to reach healthy clean air in krakw you need to go about meters up in the air its easy to connect the dots between that revelation and the games first two trailers which showcase the protagonist scientist scaling skyscrapers high above the dusty land belowblumenfeld says the studios love of survival games like subnautica and raft also led to forever skies being a title in the same genre he says those games and others were huge inspirations to the team specifically regarding subnautica far from home is a fan of how it integrated survival gameplay with a more narrativedriven focus the team envisions that for forever skies one dayas this is the very beginning of the game we want to focus on the gameplay hook so this will probably be the focus of the early access and then in the future well try and get more and more in blumenfeld says in regards to the ongoing development of the games narrativeon that note blumenfeld tells game informer the base of the story is the idea that the human race has to find its place in a new and dangerous situation that it is responsible for he says far from home isnt trying to preach but its hard not to when dire things are happening to our own earths ecologyat the core of forever skies gameplay is a special gun its a scientific tool thats fourinone an extractor tool used to extract resources and unlock new paths a building tool which as the name implies is used to build new things like ladders a repair tool used to fix damaged objects and a scanner tool which ties into the scientists goal of analyzing whats gone wrong and learning more about how to overcome the dangers of this new earththus far most of whats been shown in trailers has been a destroyed cityscape which presents an element of verticality for the games survival nature however blumenfeld says this city isnt the only biome players will encounter in forever skiesi would say that the city is not the only place blumenfeld says the city is even a little bit further in the game and there will be smaller locations its not only about the cities and there will be different biomes whats super coolis that you actually will be able to go out and below the dusthe says whats above the dust will speak directly to the ruinous status of earth the resources youre after and the story of the collapse of human civilizationwhat is below that is the evolution of an earth that doesnt belong to humans anymore blumenfeld saysin the same vein jawor cites the martian and annihilation two movies based on scifi novels as inspiration for the kind of feelings forever skies hopes to emulate in its storytelling and gameplayregardless of where you focus your exploration be it in the skyscrapers meters above the ground or the naturereborn earth below the toxic dust your airship will be with you through it all acting as your onthego laboratory and your home baseit will be your home it will be your workshop and your laboratory and it will be one of the very small number of places where you can feel a little bit of safety blumenfeld says the other thing when were thinking about the airship is how the airship moves how you control it and how you are able to play with it for example you will be able to add turbines or different devices that will change how high you can flywhen starting the game he says there will be locations you simply cant reach this is how the game pushes you to expand your ship arsenal if you want to reach that area you need a way for your airship to get up there and to do that you need the necessary upgrade that desire to find the required resources to build that upgrade might color one gameplay session and the next will be about exploring what you discover when you reach the new heights above due to the upgrade for example the airship begins with just one balloon but you can add a second to it over time upgrades balloons turbines and more make your airship feel like yoursblumenfeld says two players with hours in forever skies could theoretically have completely different airships it all depends on their focus ingamei will say that if you focus mostly on exploration in the end youll both have the same devices that will unlock your ability to get to different locations he says but if you want to take your time to customize and if you want to take your time to create different walls and different layers its definitely possible that you could end up with complex different airshipscustomization and hypothetically anything else in the game could change based on player feedback in the games pc early accessfrom the perspective of our studio its very important that we are as close as possible to the players and if you think about survival games what is the most important thing is the instant gameplay loop and the feeling that its wellbalanced and that you have something to do at all times blumenfeld tells game informer thats why we decided that we want to go in early access so we can be as close to the community as possible we would like to invite people to join us on the forever skies discord server because we are very open to ideas from the playersjawor adds that he hopes players will be interested in the games development and excited to help create some items with far from home that could be included in the final build as artifacts from the lost world he mentions posters of lost locations or a collectible for players to stumble upon when exploring a buildingplayer feedback will help influence future development although far from home has its own internal roadmap that includes cooperative multiplayer and a dedicated story mode the studio is also working on additional locations and tools tooi think what needs to be said here is that contrary to popular belief even if we are creating a game we are not really creating that game for ourselves jawor says we are working on a game that players that we hope players at least will enjoy and play for a long timeif youre interested in checking out forever skies you

And Class Combination Coming In World Of Warcraft: Dragonflight",world of warcraft is going back to its high fantasy roots with thenewly announced expansion dragonflight and after a turbulent two years in the shadowlands blizzard seems to want to reset expectations of what modern world of warcraft is all about following the reveal of the expansion which takes place in the mysterious dragon isles and looks ripe for adventurei was able to sit down with senior game designer jackie wiley and associate art director tina wang to talk about all things dragonflight including the new classrace combination dracthyr evokersthe dragon isles have been in the vocabulary of longtime wow players as the home to the powerful dragon aspects and their dragonflights prior to theburning legion invasion of years ago finally after nearly two decades we get to visit the fabled lands where we encounternew allies on the dragon isles live the dracthyr a new playable draconic race that was created by neltharion the former aspect of the black dragonflight better known to players as deathwing he manifested the dracthyr as the ideal soldiercombiningthe powers of all five dragonflights with the scrappiness and enduring nature of the mortal races of azerothdragons in world of warcraft have humanoid appearances to conversemore easily with the denizens of azeroth often times to secretly live among them the dracthyr like the traditional wow dragonswill have humanoid and draconic forms that are fully customizable by players yourdragon appearance can be designed to look like it from anyof the five dragonflights and matching scales or horns can be added to the mortal model as well like the lycanthropic worgens that came in cataclysm you can run around the world in either form but in battle the dracthyrs draconic visage will show at all times players who choose to roll this new classrace combo will get to choose which faction horde or alliance to align with and will beginin their own starting zone within the dragon islesin a new method for introducing this raceblizzard is working to maximize the dragon fantasy by allowing dracthyr to be only one class called the evoker as an evoker adracthyr hasthe combined powers of all five dragonflights utilizing abilities only those born a dragon can conceivably use thus only they are the only race able to be this class those abilities spread out across two class specializations the ranged dps devastation spec and a healingfocused spec called preservationdevastation evokersgravitate more towards the destructive powers of the red and blue dragonflights with fire arcane and frost spells to deal damage from afar this spec also borrows from the black dragonflight wang described a powerfulattack we saw in the reveal videoswhere theevoker flies in a straight lineblasting flames at the ground similar to howbosses like onyxia or deathwing would raze the land beneath thempreservation evokers on the other hand draw from the magic of the green and bronze dragons offering restorative spells through nature magic and time manipulation healing can be done with aoe spells that will bloombeneath the feet of your team or spread out in a misty cone in front of the evoker healing all party members inits range there this impression of nature with the green spells while still giving druids their own space says wang explaining the conscious effort of the team to give this new class its own identity without treading on the fantasy of other existing roles the bronze dragons are notorious for being custodians of the worlds timeline and in true bronze flight fashion evokers will use the sands of time to their benefit to keep their party safe from harm wangoffered a scenario thats possible with these bronze spells saying youll be able to perhaps have a spell that can rewind time by a few seconds the possibilities of utilizing all of the best qualities of the dragonflights give the dracthyr alot of potential forfun and flavorful tools at their disposal even before adding in the new unique mechanic available to them in empowerunlike any other class before it the evokercan utilize a new mechanic called empower with it they can change the properties of select spells by pressing and holding a spell keybinduntil the desired effect happens sometimes thats charging a spell longer for a more intense and damaging blast an extended area of effect or an ability to hit more targets the longer a skill is empowered ive loved using similar mechanics in games like lost ark and im happy to hear something like empower is making its way into warcraft and creating a unique play pattern for the evokerwiley says that accessibility is a big focus for the team the wow teamis making sureplayers have the choice to use empower by either holding down the keyor toggling when the effect endswith a button press whichever works better for that personwe have we had actually a lot of dracthyr playtests both internally and with players who need the accessibility options as well says wiley using all the things we been learning over time and the expertise we have on the team we trying to make it so everyone can play wowi itching toget my hands on the dracthyr evokers and level one up when dragonflight eventually releases the fantasy of becoming a dragon race and having a class built around the skills and abilities inherent to the species is unique within world of warcraft and is flavorfully magnificent although i have to wait a while before creating my first dracthyr as of now theres no timeframe for when the expansion is to be released but i was assured that the alpha will be going live soon and some players will get their hands on dragonflightsometime in the coming months as forthe full launch

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/18/into-the-multiverse-of-the-metaverse,Into the Multiverse of the Metaverse,depending on who you ask the metaverse could be any number of things for some its highly centralized around gaming existing as an mmolike experience for others its a virtual workspace or a digital version of the world we already live in the most commonly accepted version of the metaverse though is something that resembles ready player one where all of your favorite characters friends and family members interact with each other in a virtual world or at least thats the most idealized vision ofwhat the metaverse could beof course thats not a reality at the moment and the closest somethings come might be epics juggernaut freetoplay battle royale game fortnite but longrunning mmos like ccp games eve online might be just as close to what the metaverse may become a virtual world where players become entirely different people living completely different lives they might be the commander of a space fleet igniting a war to colonize planets prime for resources or they might be a simple trader on a peaceful planetfor ccp ceo hilmar ptursson conversations about the metaverse are nothing new in conversation you can sense the blas outlook he has on the idea not because he isnt interested in it but because they are the same ideas hes heard shuffled in gaming circles since the release of snow crash a foundational scifi novel that set a precedent not necessarily the precedent for what a metaverse could be even going as far as to coin the word metaversewe basically had the whole concept of the metaverse in snow crash ptursson says it was the first wave of the metaverse hype and there were plenty of companies doing this what we were basically envisioning was to take the internet to the web being the internet then we wanted to build the internet in vr and if you look at the latest kind of sparked dialogue around the word metaverse it is almost like nothing has changedptursson is alluding to an ongoing discourse thats been brewing for years heightened when social media giant facebook changed its name to meta back in october of last year and highlighted a possible workfocused metaverse ptursson isnt interested in this concept for him the metaverse can be and should be so much more game informer recently spoke to four different companies either developing metaverse games or developing gamerelated software despite different outlooks on the metaverse there was one commonality its about agencyfollowing the release of snow crash the word metaverse was thrown around just as haphazardly as it is today as its defined in the novel the metaverse is a hyperreal digital world so real that for example if your online avatar was hacked with a dangerous virus you might experience actual brain damage companies like makena technologies and immersion corp pitched their own ideas of that metaverse with less brain damage but technology in the proved too primitive to bring it to lifethe idea subsided until innovations in the early when games such as second life and playstation home revitalized the discussion once again by then mmos like world of warcraft and eve online were in the hands of gamers and becoming more popular and while metaverse discussion had calmed once more the term metaverse could have easily been swapped with mmo fast forward years and ptursson is aware that the metaverse discussions of the and then the are returning and yet he thinks were still another years off from the metaverse everyone pictures in their headwhile the term metaverse remains almost as nebulous as it has in years past its potential to transform the world or at least gaming is evidentthe idea of the metaverse is so attractive because it feels like something where you will have more agency which is related to power ptursson says why do people go and play games online its about the power fantasy i cannot currently build a space empire in real lifein eve online though he can and millions of players do because at the heart of the game is agency the same agency that might prop up the metaverse one day if you want to build a space empire in eve online the skeleton needed to do that is there if it doesnt interest you theres plenty else you can dohowever discussions about the metaverse such as this carry with them a sense of irony the metaverse is about agency and power fantasies and doing what you didnt think possible because the metaverse isnt really a thing beyond a buzz word silicon valley especially loves right now you can say the metaverse is this or the metaverse is that and youd be right because its whatever you want it to be considering video games have been providing us the stories and gameplay of people we wish we were or werent for decades the idea of the metaverse as its largely viewed today makes us ask is the only difference between video games we all know and love and the metaverse a cheesy cyberpunkesque headpiece that puts us into virtual reality the more companies like meta input into the discourse the more it certainly seems that wayandrew eiche the coo of owlchemy labs the studio behind vr titles like job simulator has a view similar to pturssons assessment of agency and why the idea of the metaverse is not just recurring but powerfulpeople want to feel connected right eiche says i think the pandemic has accelerated this in that we understand the stark limitations of video chat better than ever facetime was good enough but now that weve really had to rely on it we understand that there has to be something better and i think the metaverse is a place right now where we can find that connectionbut our grandmothers arent going to log in to something like eve online to gain a better connection to us they probably need a different kind of user interface to feel what eve online players feel when playing together something that realizes holotech studios inc cofounder and ceo dragosflorin stanculescus view of the metaverse life as we already know it enhanced by new technologiesholotechs animaze is an advanced overlay that people can use on video calls or streams and these arent just simple overlays they blink and track your eyes facial movements and arms too sure theres an element of fun to it all but at the heart of what holotech is trying to do is a desire to help people be who they want to bei think that being able to overcome your anxiety by becoming somebody else is really important in this digital age and having a tool that enables people to do that is really important stanculescu says theres also the more philosophical side of things whats real and whats better than real we crave hyperreality its why we prefer things with a brighter color thats why we prefer sweet things thats why we are so easily hooked on unnatural beauty standards that you do in photoshop these supernormal stimuli actually work very well in our brains and hyperreality plucks those stringsthe metaverse so often veers into hyperreality territory as a result of that stimuli stanculescu says animaze is there to meet people where that hyperreality clicks for them if theyre more comfortable as a dragon in the metaverse animaze wants to have an avatar overlay ready for themfor me this is progress towards a better form of communication that we cant do in our human form he saysthe possibilities for what one person needs to obtain that connection versus another person are theoretically endless and eiche believes thats why there are different metaverses out there right nowmicrosoft gaming ceo phil spencer sees metaverses as varying from one person to the next too although hes not quite sure a metaverse is anything more than the virtual spaces weve been playing in for decadesi definitely see the metaverse as an extension of what gaming has been doing spencer told the new york times in a recent interview i think as we look at the workplace going online and hybrid work environments where we might have some of our coworkers together in one place and others that are on the other end of a call we look at these virtual spaces and apply some of the things that weve learned in video games of people coming together to achieve tasksspencer said that at microsoft the thinking on the metaverse is very much about taking what the company has already learned about online interaction and applying it to what the next evolution of say microsoft teams might be the xbox head also believes that its important to acknowledge that for many growing up today video games are the place to seek and find social connection instead of playing on a playground after school friends might meet up in an online gamefor the generation growing up with games spencer believes the metaverse will be a much easier concept to grasp taketwo interactive ceo strauss zelnick would agree with spencers belief that video games already exist as metaversesi would argue were taketwo interactive probably the biggest metaverse company on earth if you look in terms of revenue and profits because were in grand theft auto online which really i think defines the metaverse today zelnick told cnbc last novemberthe taketwo ceo is on board with video games existing as metaverses but hes cautious of tech companies like meta entering the space he said he doesnt believe metas vision of the metaverse is what consumers want adding that hes skeptical people want to conduct all of their usual daily tasks digitallyzelnick joins many others in the tech industry who are wary of where metaverse discussions are going especially regarding metas vision of it even playstation creator ken kutaragi cant get behind the idea of a metaverse as its envisioned by many todayyou would rather be a polished avatar instead of your real self kutaragitold bloombergin january thats essentially no different from anonymous message board sites headsets would isolate you from the real world and i cant agree with that headsets are simply annoyingwhile kutaragi finds headsets like psvr or the meta quest annoying others find some of their favorite video game experiences in them like owlchemys job simulator but just because someone enjoys a few hours in a vr video game doesnt mean theyre ready to strap on that same headset all day to complete tasks like take the virtual dog out for a walk grab virtual coffee at the virtual coffee shop down the virtual street or even the eversoexciting complete work in a virtual office that work says is better than your home officeinstead eiche points to roblox as an example of where the idea of a metaverse is todaywhen i look at the metaverse i look at it as a set of different kinds of things and existences and environments or at least places where you could live eiche says fortnite is an example of a space with a lot of different things and roblox too you can even start to map some of the parallels between whats real and roblox if you ask me is the metaverse the office eventually it will be but the thing that you think will be the office is just not going to work out because youre starting by bounding yourself youre building a literal cubicle with walls around what you can dofor sandbox cofounder and coo sebastien borget who runs pixowl inc the metaverse is supposedly a sandbox where nfts and blockchainminted items can pass boundlessly from one thing to the next the sandbox is an mmo that readily uses the word metaverse to describe itself it resembles minecraft and the touryst in graphics but is decidedly built around multiplayer interaction and relies heavily on the idea of nfts and owning digital land with receipts kept on the blockchainits received millions in funding and has a sizeable player base growing significantly in to reach more than it has branding partners in snoop dogg the walking dead atari and over more despite its lesserknown popularity in traditional gaming circles its a powerhouse in the world of nft gamesborget says the sandbox is positioned as an open metaverse that enables users to truly own their digital assets and the creations they maketo us the metaverse is essentially a digital parallel universe where users human beings will be engaging with more social more immersive experiences through an avatar or character that will be a representation of itself borget says they will use that same avatar across multiple experiences and to go a bit further the metaverse is not a single company in our opinion it is not meta its not facebook its not roblox its not fortnite its a myriad of online virtual worlds its the plurality of them and this is the idea users can transfer their identity their digital assets their virtual belongings their currency to different worldsas many have pointed out before this doesnt consider developers which are the most important aspect of this idea of the metaverse in order for your favorite weapon skin from valorant to work in fortnite as pushers of nfts have envisioned both riot games and epic games would need to communicate and work out the technicalities of bringing a skin designed for one games weapon over to a completely different game not to mention said skin would need to be turned into an nft first which is something it seems many developers would be opposed to doing on principle anyway in short this isnt a realityhowever borget believes the sandbox is already on its way to doing that and it is but only within the confines of the sandbox and cryptowalletshow those nft contents are then represented in any application is up to a developer borget saysup to a developer is key though and its why the crossplatform nature of nfts and blockchain gaming usually doesnt get far it also prompts the question what developers are willing and have the time to open up a games walls to allow content from this game or that into it thats a question the sandbox and other companies diving into nfts like ea ubisoft konami and square enix will need to address and then theyll need to answer the environmental aspect of nfts and explain how their nft moves arent just a new form of microtransactions with a particularly sinister spin in the form of playtoearn in some casesdespite borgets positive outlook on this idea of the metaverse theres the inherently negative aspect of all this blockchain games and nfts have drawn heavy criticism in the industry thus far due to their part in ongoing environmental damage plus many view nfts as scams or at least scamlike in naturepixowl released a blog post last summerthat said after switching to polygons layer the game was able to reduce its carbon footprint of nfts by up to as many have pointed out before if a carbon footprint was already times greater than what we as a society already create decreasing said footprint by doesnt necessarily mean its good for the earth its just not as bad for it as it used to be and even if an nft transaction is now green there are still other concerns surrounding nfts in general like true ownership whether the content was stolen before it was minted and moreeiche and many others are critical of the nftpowered idea of the metaverse there are two reasons why the metaverse persists decade after decade according to eiche and the first is the idea of striving for a better connection the second though is more cynicalits an avenue for money and its the next big battleground for yours eiche says a company might say oh crap we may not have won social media or maybe you are a company that did win social media facebookmeta and youre like wow we cant lose the next one right thats the cynical answereiche homes in on something that every person game informer spoke to touched on like it or hate it the metaverse is going to happen what it looks like is still unknown and when it actually arrives is too but as ptursson points out its going to keep coming aroundand its likely to have a different definition each time like in the and the that preceded it the metaverse grows in concept alongside the expansion of the internet and gaming as we know it before we could tangibly enter virtual reality worlds the metaverse was all about vr now that vr is here the metaverse needs to be more whos to say that when we finally achieve the metaverse the always hypothesized that it wont just as quickly grow stale leaving users wanting more much in the same way mmos websites and social media platforms do today the metaverse is a destination many are after but as it stands today its nothing more than an endless chase which company crosses the finish line first will depend on whose definition of the metaverse we the eventual userbase agree uponthis article originally appeared

ivyesterday thetantalizing cinematic trailer showed off amore maturelooking sora exploring a realistic human city invaded by heartless naturally the video raised countless questions but it also led us to gush about the things we want to see in the hotlyanticipated sequelthats why we the kingdom hearts fans in thegame informerofficecouldnt help butshare ourpersonal hopes and dreams for the next game let us know what you think of our wishlists and be sure to share your own desires and expectations down in the commentswesley leblancthere are two things i want most out of kingdom hearts iv a new pirates of the caribbean world that builds off of the foundation of kingdom hearts iiis iteration and a full dream drop dive into quadratum the world of verum rex and ultimately nomuras final fantasy versus xiii frankenstein monster by way of kingdom heartsnomuras canceledversus xiii game is wellknown and if youve played kingdom hearts iii you know how much of versus xiii exists inits inuniverseverum rex video game nomura is making this lost projectone way or another and i respect that kind of dedication that hes seemingly going to make it happen through kingdom hearts is the most nomura thing ever kingdom hearts iii gave us a taste of what that looks like but i hope that in some way shape or form kingdom hearts iv features even more of nomuras versus xiii in itoh and i hope we get a star wars world in kingdom hearts iv and while were at it lets get some marvel cinematic universe love in there too if only to see nomura recreate the famous avengers endgame portal scene in such a way that we see sora donald goofy and mickey emergealongside the likes of spiderman and black panthermarcus stewartill preface my upcoming rant by disclosing that i am in fact a kingdom hearts fan not a diehard but ive finished and enjoyed nearly every game to some extent that said what i want more than any movie representation combat mechanic or zipperladen outfit is an improvement on the series atrocious writing im not talking about its overly complicated narrative that ship has already sailed mostly over my head i mean the actual spoken dialogueplaying kingdom hearts iii made me realize that ive outgrown the franchise hamfisted conversations the dialogue in these games has always been unnaturally stilted riddledwith awkward midsentence pauses and uncomfortable silences before someone speaks up again i put up with it in the but it drove me up a wall in kh iii robbing many emotional moments of their gravitassince were apparently journeying to the real world in kh iv follow suit by making sora and co speak and emote closer to actual humans and not like unintentionalparodiesof bad anime tropes the writingdoesnt need to be naughty dog levels of excellence feel free to surprise me and i don mind it being silly the dialogue just needs to be betteri feel likemy wish is about as likely to happen as sora helping maggie the cowin ahome on the range world but a man can dreamoh and can we finally get a world based on a goofy movie complete with a playable rendition of eye to eye pretty please squaremnica rexach ortizi hope kingdom hearts ivwill help us understand where sora is in kingdom hearts iii we see sora save and switch places with kairi after xehanort sends her heart to nothingness the biggest questions for me after that ending where is sora is he dead lost or is he what does it mean to die in kingdom hearts is this where xion landed when she was and most importantly will sora ever become a keyblade master like his best friend riku and will he learn to wield the power of wakingmy second hope isthat kingdom hearts ivsheds some light on many of the major plot pointsleft unanswered in the previous gamesid also like to see new and exciting disney worlds with fun mechanics i want worlds based on coco star wars encanto marvel movies frozen ii wreckit ralph moanainside out there are so many to choose from i also hope theyll include some of the musical elements of these movies i loved being able to sing along during the frozen world in kingdom hearts iii and i was a fan of the rhythm game in the little mermaid world from kingdom hearts iimy final wish is for the ability to swap between main characters again like in birth by sleep it was so fun to experience the main story from three different points of view and use characters with different fighting styles i would love to experience kingdom hearts ivfrom the lens of kairi sora and riku as they find their way back to each otherjohn carsonits hard to tell where kingdom hearts should go these days especially with leaning into realism in its first trailer obviously the lucasfilm and marvel universes are easy to see as the next potential worlds to explore throw sora on a treasure hunt with indiana jones and have him travel the stars with the guardians of the galaxy in a gummi ship both would be viable and entertaining but id like to lean into the other half of what made kingdom hearts special to me in the first place give me more final fantasy characters and worldsi havent played anything past kingdom hearts ii but i am aware that existing final fantasy characters all but disappeared in kh iii despite aspects of what was final fantasy versusxiiifinal fantasy xv bleeding into the series let donald goofy and sora explore ivalice midgar balamb garden or eorzea with characters from those games of course disney is the big name attached to sell copies of the game but these days id rather see ffxii balthier show up than the cast of luca or encanto to change things up a bit and return to the series roots other than that i hope nomura finally gets to make the versus xiii hes been itching to get out of his system for more than a decade its clear he cant move on from those ideas until theyve come to fruition in some form or fashionkim wallacekingdom hearts iv moving the series into a realworld landscape greatly opens up the possibilities of what can be done and in turn what i want in the next game things i never felt were possible for the series suddenly seem like they just might be im excited to explore quadratum and see how much inspiration it takes from tokyo and its landmarks the realistic setting and graphics would also lend themselves well to disneys marvel and star war properties unfortunately whether we see marvel or star wars worldscharacters really comes down to disney kingdom hearts iii was financially successful so it might make disney bend more but as we heard from director tetsuya nomura disneys approval process can be challenging and complicated but please make it happen that being said i hope the animated worlds still have a big place in iv if were going for my world wishlist turning red encanto moana and coco rank the highesti also want to see final fantasy characters brought back in some meaningful way for iv sora practically looks like hes straight out of the final fantasy series now twinning with squall its only fitting on the topic of gameplay give me those super bosses and intense fights the earlier entries were known for but add in more verticality and options for destruction the trailer showed it was going in this direction which makes me happy especially with sora now having a grappling hook and sliding through buildings i loved flowmotion from dream drop distance and i got vibes of that when watching ivs reveal especially as sora swung on the utility pole and launched himself in the air so i hope iv feels more like an upgraded version of thatas to not spoil anything i will keep my story wants brief while kingdom hearts iii provided some conclusions it also left a lot on the table and many characters still need their moment in the sun lea and kairi cough cough i also feel like ivs more realistic bent is the opportunity for the story to be darker and go deeper into its themes of loss and friendship and maybe even finally help us let go of sora i love sora but its time for someone new to take the mantle and the series to grow beyond him if anything is clear its that you cant really put your finger on where kingdom hearts will go next as nomura has proven hes full of surprises no matter how many cryptic clues he leaves for us this is the biggest shift weve seen in the series and i dont mind that being embracedbecause it could be a fantastic rebirth for a new generation that takesthings to an exciting new levelfor more on kingdom hearts iv be sure to read about how its being developed using unreal engine speculation of star wars endor appearing in the

Acquisitions, Live Service Games, E3, His New Company, And More",jack tretton was the president and ceo of sony computer entertainment america from to but his history with the playstation brand stretches back to its very beginnings he joined sony in and worked on the team that created its first home console the playstation tretton continued his work with the playstation team to launch the playstation one of the most successful video game consoles of all time in and then the playstation portable in before becoming sceas chiefas president and ceo of scea he was the face of playstation in marketing on stages in interviews and more especially stateside his legacy is playstation through and through but when talking to tretton its clear he loves all video games not just the ones playstation makes and the industry surrounding them when he stepped down from scea in tretton was nervous and anxious to go out on his own but he knew it was something he wanted to doi was really anxious to go out on my own and kind of pick and choose my partners and pick and choose the things i was excited about because you get exposed to so many great things on the corporate side but you kind of have to universally love everything they love whether you do down in your heart or not tretton tells game informer independently assuming youre not chasing a dollaryou can really pick and choose the things that youre passionate about and indie game development was certainly i think the most exciting thing thats happened in my career to go from or big companies around the world that control of the business in the console space and the need to have a big company with big budgets and the resources to distribute your games around the world to a brick and mortar retailand with the advent of digital publishing and digital stores all of a sudden every creator could become a publisher to me that was incredibly excitingthat excitement led to tretton becoming the ceo of powerup acquisition corporation which includes other industry veterans like former activision blizzard vice chairman bruce hack in powerup is a special purpose acquisition company or spac that looks to play in the behindthescenes space of the industry but in talking with tretton powerups current objective is best defined as find a studio or publisher and lend to it the experience support mentorship and financial investment behind the team at the company powerup is already a public company launching a million initial public offering on february powerup closed the ipo six days later on february reaching roughly million now tretton says it is looking to merge with a company that holds a billion valuationwe already are public so by merging with us they would become public tretton says so were giving them access to public markets as opposed to trying to file an ipo raise money and go public on their own and then obviously the shareholders would vote on the company that we elect to merge with and assuming that all goes well then that public entity is the combination of the two companies and obviously we would keep the name of whatever the company is that we merge withtretton says merging with utility companies media companies and other adjacents is a possibility but due to his background hes really pushing for the merge to happen with a publisher or a developer citing how big the pond is of this billion industry tretton says his bet is that video games are where powerup lands but that really any company with positive revenue a competitive market position and a good vision on how to grow a business down the road would work as a great option for powerupby going with us we can help them raise money and we obviously bring the access to the public markets and we bring our relationships and expertise in growing businesses and raising money specifically in the video game space tretton says i think thats what really makes us unique toother forms of fundraising or growthwhile powerup is a spac tretton says the organization is not looking to eat up multiple companies or even one company and change entire dynamics thats why powerup is looking for a developer or publisher thats already wellestablished and firing on all cylindersi think we want somebody whos got a longterm view tretton tells game informer were certainly not going to join this company and walk away from the venture in any way shape or form but we also want to make it crystal clear that were not looking to take it over eitherhowever tretton is fascinated with the acquisitions that have largely defined the gaming landscape in thus far both as the ceo of a spac and as a former playstation boss it started with taketwo interactive the parent company behind the grand theft auto series announcing back in january that it was acquiring mobile giant zynga for nearly billion then a week later microsoft announced that it was acquiring activision blizzard the company behind overwatch and call of duty for a colossal billion and then two weeks later sony revealed it was buying bungie for billion a few weeks after that sony announced it had acquired jade raymonds new studio haven studios acquisitions continue to happen as do rumors of additional purchases like these and tretton says is the most amazing year for acquisitions hes ever seentheres a way to look at virtually everything that happens as being glass halffull or glass halfempty and you can find ways to come up with negatives about these acquisitions but i think the positives far outweigh the negatives tretton says and the positives are that it brings attention to an industry thats already billion and growing and even though its more than double the size of the box office and the music industry combined i still think you find a lot of people out there that dont appreciate how big and sophisticated andmainstream entertainment gaming istretton says a multitrillion dollar company like microsoft purchasing a company like activision blizzard for nearly billion is a testament to how big this industry is and how big microsoft is betting on it he recognizes the negative or glass half empty perspectives on acquisitions happening this year but overall theyre good for the industry he says some talk about acquisitions happening between companies like sony and microsoft as competitive as if one company is acquiring in response to anothers acquisition but tretton doesnt see it that wayhe says that back in the day when playstation and xbox were just starting out the competition was certainly there but now the two have grown to be so big that each is executing its own strategy personalized to its goalsi think back in the day when i was back at sony and we were trying to establish this playstation brand and xbox came out and were trying to compete with such a formidable company in microsoft it very much was win at the expense of the competition counter what theyre doing block what theyre doing but i think the businesses have grown so big now that it isnt that way anymorehowever tretton says nintendo always followed the beat of its own drum and could never be accused of trying to imitate anybody else and now today microsoft and sony could be lumped into the same kind of business mindset he says for example he doesnt believe microsoft will make call of duty an xbox exclusive something hes confident it would have done had it purchased activision blizzard years agohe points to microsofts commitment to releasing games on pc and sonys commitment to an extent as well as an indicator that things are different he also points to a sony studio developing mlb the show a game thats no longer exclusive to playstation consoles and now released on xbox consoles and switch too its not about keeping your ip solely proprietary to one place anymore its about doing what makes the most sense and helping the bottom line according to trettonrising tides lift all boats tretton says the competition in the video game industry is not nintendo versus sony versus xbox it is video games as an entertainment form against watching tv going to concerts whatever other forms of entertainment you have so the gaming industry is competing for peoples time and mindshare and the more great entertainment experiences there are the more that people in the video game business and the people that enjoy playing video games have to choose fromi think i would much rather a competitor invest in the video game space than a competitor invest in the movie industry or the music industry because to me investing in the movie industry isnt necessarily going to help grow the video game businessacquisitions have defined but since trettons departure from playstation in which was the same year destiny was released the gaming landscape has been transformed perhaps most drastically by gamesasaservice otherwise known as live service games while these types of experiences have been around for quite some time bungies destiny popularized the definition most people likely think of when they hear live service today games like fortnite have presented their own spins on it too introducing battle passrelated microtransactions that have largely overtaken the loot box model although the controversy surrounding loot boxes and their relation to gambling helped speed that up too now sony which has a video game portfolio defined mostly by narrativedriven singleplayer experiences is diving headfirst into gamesasaservice in february playstation revealed plans to launch live services games by and acquisitions of studios like bungie and haven studios speak directly to thatwith tretton leaving playstation right as live service games as a genre really began to take off he said he couldnt have foreseen playstations commitment but hes still not surprised to him its just about whether or not these games turn out to be great experiencesi think ultimately if its a great entertainment experience and a great value for the consumer then it will succeed tretton tells game informer if it is a money grab and if its trying to take old content and make people pay for it then it wont everybody looks at their entertainment dollar value and whether theyre choosing between an indie game a major release from a major publisher whether theyre paying or whether theyre paying a subscription service its all going to come down to how much they enjoy it how they choose to spend their time and the amount of entertainment they get per dollar versus other alternatives one thing that remains constant is there are still only hours in a day right so if the value is good the gamer is going to respondif the value of a playstationdeveloped liveservice game is good tretton believes the market will respond positively he says the one thing you need to do as a console maker is find ways to keep your controller in consumer hands and he sees the appeal of live service games in that regard these types of games are designed to keep you playing or at least checking in daily and thats a win for studios and publishersthe more that console is left on the more opportunities that companies have to make money and the more people spend time on it and find joy in it the more value publishers get out of the investment theyve made he says theres this marriage between the consumer and the manufacturer or the publisher that has to exist where both parties have to be happy or it doesnt work outanother major talking point in gaming thats sprung up since tretton left playstation almost a decade ago is cloud gaming playstation now launched right before his departure and since then well it hasnt really done too much in the discussion of cloud gaming sure there are a lot of ps now subscribers but its fair to say microsofts more recent expansion to cloud gaming is already a more attractive option than ps now when comparing the two sidebyside at least in the zeitgeist perhaps sony will shift the scales a bit when its revamped playstation plus service which bundles in ps now launches this june but that remains to be seenwhen asked if he thought cloud gaming would become as prominent in games as it is today tretton said he always saw the potential but didnt expect it to happen so fast he says sony led the charge with its thengaikai purchase while microsoft took a waitandsee approach he doesnt think microsofts approach hurt it in any way eitherif you look back at that time sony made a pretty significant investment to get in that business and get a firstmover advantage tretton says and microsofts attitude was kind of more of a wait and see and i guess the fundamental question is did that investment in earlymover status really benefit sony did it hurt microsoft i think the reality of the situation is it certainly didnt hurt microsofthe says he ultimately saw the journey to cloud gaming being a to journey before it became anything significant at all because he didnt think the technology was really there during his final years at sony however he recognizes the exponential growth of technology and believes the timing of cloud gaming today to be pretty goodthe experience is getting better for gamers the value is getting better and both companies have pretty good offerings tretton says before stating that nintendos own service is getting better tooin between powerup thoughts about acquisitions cloud gaming and more tretton says hes been thinking a lot about and lately the way its seemingly coming to an end tretton was the face of sony at many conferences during his time as scea president and he says it was always one of his favorite parts of the job he remembers seeing all kinds of expos pop up for this industry and that and yearning for one focused on video games when came around in he was excited citing that it felt like it was a real coronation for the industryit really went through probably a period where it was really a celebration of the industry and you had major parties with major rock bands performing tretton tells game informer you had a large amount of press from around the world not just from the united states going to it and it certainly didnt start that wayit then swung the other direction with companies feeling too much money was being spent on the eventthen it went to big companies having to mind their bottom line and saying my god were spending all this money on a trade show to get pr do we really need to do an event like this for the press we want to drive our bottom line and we want to scale back our commitment to and that was very disappointing to meand the pendulum swung back the other way once more to a big again he saysthats when you had the big press conferences between the microsofts and the nintendos and all the big publishers and people were waiting to hear what was going to be announced and what the big news was and i certainly enjoyed that a great deal tretton tells game informer it was a massivelystressful event to put on but it was the marquee event for your company for the year if you had a good showing you were going to have a good year and if you had a bad showing it was going to be a rough year it had a lot of pressure on it but i really enjoyed ittretton says he doesnt think is as valuable and as necessary as it has been in the past but he believes video games need their own marquee event much like music has the grammy awards and movies the oscars some would argue that geoff keighleys annual show the game awards has become that still tretton says if is done for as many have speculated with canceled altogether its a loss for the industry and its ability toreally celebrate and trumpet all the innovation and great things that it does so id love to see it come backas for where companies are heading today with many holding their own miniature conferences tretton says the lens you view these approaches determines whether theyre successful or not if you look at sonys state of plays or nintendo directs from a financial viewpoint you will probably be in favor of these individual showcases but if youre someone whos about marketing you might be proshow like something seen at he saysits really going to come down to your financial wherewithal and your priority of where you think the brand is at and whether or not you think you want to do events like that tretton says i think you can look at it as an outsider and go okay the motivation here is clearly financial companies get to make those decisions and it clearly comes at a financial cost to do an event like that but it does drive visibilityit comes down to whether or not your bottom line can handle it and whether or not your bottom line is your number one priority i think ultimately thats where the decision gets made,en,857.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/11/lifting-the-fog-on-side-activities-in-forspoken,Lifting The Fog On Side Activities In Forspoken,forspoken is a storyheavy game with the narrative mainly tying into the central quest but forspoken is not a linear game and with such a vast open world we wondered what happens if you step off the golden path to satisfy our curiosity we recently sat down with developer luminous productions and got our first look at the games various side activities and optionalobjectives you can find around the map besides seeing more of the magical parkour in action and noticing the plethora of crafting materials lying around the realm the team walked us through crafting in refuges enhancing stats at monuments finding knowledge in the guild towers and venturing into the depths of corruptionas the name suggests refuges scattered throughout athia provide frey a space away from the everlooming fog and the hostile creatures under its influence the retreat we saw water garden central refuge reflects athias current state its exterior is plastered with images that evoke the ecclesiastical imagery of our worlds medieval and renaissance periods this suggests athia was at some recent point a thriving culture with a rich artistic tradition now however those images are fading and shrouded by ominous mist the buildings roof is missing patches and its stone foundation is starting to crumbleentering the shelter the game notifies us that the structure is now a fasttravel destination as frey heads towards a cobwebbed corner with a workbench players can upgrade their gear or craft new items here the crafting options include brewing healing potions and increasing the carrying capacity for the medicine and materials pouches a helpful note on the table across from the workbench details the worlds lore includinginformation onathias oncebenevolent but now breakcorrupted rulers the tantas the information is neatly tucked away into a menu tab that players can access later if they want probably the most intriguing data gleaned from the refuges manuscripts are the locations of various other shelters in the nearby area all of which are automatically populated on the players map so frey can venture out to find them later this system seems like a really good way to give players an idea of what to do out in the world without requiring them to stumble blindly through the breaknot far from the refuge the map shows an unexplored structure called the lutetia guild it may lie outside the critical path but the towerlooking map marker proves too intriguing to ignore flagging it on the map prompts a floating icon to appear in the world making the guild easy to locate the magical parkour system really shines along the way as frey leaps up and over a handful of steep cliffs in styleforspokens traversal system truly seems like one of its biggest draws and the open world is a perfect playground to revel in freys enchanted dashing according to the games codirector takefumi terada the developers put a ton of effort into perfecting the fastpaced and fluid movement abilities this work is evident as we watch frey bound across the landscape and in a matter of seconds reach the faade of an imposing stone building larger than the refuge this multistoried tower houses rows of books scores of crafting resources and even unexpected enemiesa group of scholars once graced this locations halls and by rummaging in their abandoned research frey discovers clues connecting to the lore of her own quest along with more points of interest to explore after climbing several flights of stairs to the top we see that getting down is even more fun than the journey up frey launches off the storieshigh roof activating a handy gravitydefying spell to cushion her fall before actually hitting the ground a good thing because the developers confirmthere is fall damage in forspoken so be careful not to plunge over a precipice without the necessary magicon your travels through athia youll occasionally find lofty memorials that offer frey the chance to increase her stats called monuments in the preview we checked out the monument to strength its shape recalls an egyptian ankh pointing to one of the games realworld cultural inspirations raio mitsuno forspokens creative producer explained that the team was interested in weaving ideas from our world into athias this according to mitsuno is where the developers got the idea for statboosting nail polish much like how in ancient egyptian and babylonian societies decorating and adorning ones nails was part of the culture its very much the same with athia mitsuno says with the games unusually expansive female cast this system raises a few concerns but its difficult to say how the final game will execute the ideaits easy to imagine that the massive monument would have made an impression when it was first erected but its worn cracked platform currently conveys only longfaded grandeur the elements are chipping away at the blocks of cut stone lining the walkway and grass is starting to spring up through the cracks a spikey otherworldly aura surrounds the main shrine but frey dispels this with a burst of her own magic and the corrupted shell cracks and slides offextending her hand out to the newly revealed monument frey receives an upgrade to her defense this is a sensible boon to get from the monument to strength a memorial connected to athias tanta sila who embodies the same trait the other monuments youll find throughout the world will similarly link to the other tantas and they will likely boost a stat related to each ruling womans defining characteristicin an earlier preview event luminous productions introduced players to break storms a kind of influx of fog that sweeps through the land swallowing anything in its path if frey gets swept into the phenomenon shell face hordes of incredibly difficult enemies but the team promises the challenge will be worth the reward we didnt get to see what happens at the end of a break storm as frey died during the fight but in our recent sitdown the developers introduced us to a different phenomenon called depths of corruptionvarious realms will feature a location that is heavily dominated by the corrupting fog we saw frey venturing into one realms most breakinfested area its grassy fields quickly giving way to the mist at the densest point frey stands in a landscape that looks made of fog there is a pit at its center and the player is prompted to jump in following the command frey appears as though she plunged into a deep body of water and at the bottom is a surreal land where enemies provide plenty of challengealong with specific landmarks and dangerous break sites forspokens open world offers abandoned villages to explore geological features to leap over and treasures to plunder there are even small dungeons called seatof reflections to fight through though we will dive deeper into these later this month as we continue to celebrate forspoken as our march cover story,en,168.0,Positive

productions and this months cover story largely takes place in the magical world of athia unfortunately the realm has seen better days as a creeping corruption has flooded the onceprosperous land the break as the destructive fog is known in the game has the power to corrupt anything it touches humans become hostile and mindless animals morph into monsters and even the land itself takes on a bizarre appearancewhile there have been several trailers for forspoken much of them take place in a dry desertlooking region this land is just outside cipal the last dwelling in athia for those unaffected by the break however athias world is actually filled with a lot of variation some of which we recently got to see just past the rocky fields and ominous fog lies a region the developers revealed in a handsoff demo exclusively for game informer avoaletunlike its neighboring realm avoalet boasts a thriving verdant landscape the first area we saw in this land is fittingly called the water garden the name underscores avoalets fertile nature while also connecting to larger design themes creative producer raio mitsuno explains that each realm has a distinct identityavoalet is very blue and lush with green and flowers and bodies of water says mitsuno but the break has done really messed up stuff to the landscapethat includes warping the areas native creatures into crazed beasts within moments of entering the realm a pair of mutant bucks attack frey their flesh looks like it was melted with molten gold which leaves the animals gilded in an unnatural weblike pattern the metallic latticework weaves up past the creatures black lifeless eyes and wraps around viciously pointed antlers its these sharp weapons that we first see emerging out of the heavy fog as the deer ram into the games heroine after a hardwon fight full of dramatic magical combat frey continues moving into the murky new land eventually the break begins to lighten revealing avoalets striking scenerytall trees shade vibrant patches of flowers from a sunny sky the scene is peaceful and starkly contrasts with the savage fight frey just left behind but dont let the tranquility fool you there are still dangers lurking around every corner on a nearby cliff is an unopened chest its guarded by a flock of predatory birds which swoop out of the brilliant blue sky to attack the unwary frey as she attempts to collect the treasure quickly scooping up the crafting components inside the chest frey zips off using her magical parkour skills for an easy escapedespite the lovely surroundings the game still takes time to remind the player that the break affected avoalet just as much as the rest of athia an empty cart with crafting material still left in its bed is stuck in the mud crates are strewn around the vehicle and it seems clear that someone tried to flee the coming corruption only to abandon their possessions in a desperate momentthe conditions are harsh the human drama and problems are just as real as in new york even if the circumstances are heightened says story writer todd stashwick the stakes now for frey are more than just her own problems its life or death for a lot of peoplejust down the road frey finds a refuge and lutetia guild location these are places where she can discover more about the worlds past craft needed items and add locations to her map but it isnt long before shes off againavoalet like any other area in athia is ruled by a tanta a magicwielding queen meant to embody one distinct ideal tanta prav the tanta of justice rules this lush kingdom however tanta pravs judgment has been corrupted by the break transforming her into an alarming adjudicator with merciless minions as frey reaches the merveil bridge which leads to pravs court she runs into a score of unjust enforcers these avoaletspecific enemies obey the tantas command but dont pose too much of a threat unfortunately for frey these foes have a pitiless arbiter on their sidethe blackclad blindfolded miniboss holds a set of scales in one hand and a ferociouslooking ax in the other using one for magic attacks and the other for melee the pitiless arbiter is ready to execute a swift death sentence the fight on the bridge is intense partly because of how far above the ground the fighters are but it isnt the last battle frey will face before reaching the lands ruler the foeriddled city of gyuzel and an abandoned castle town buried in the depths of corruption test freys magical combat skillsafter defeating everyone in the first location frey finds a blue cape with a description that suggests it once belonged to the tanta of justice whose kingdom is deeply connected to the garments royal hue the cloak isnt just for show as it extends the duration of freys positive status effects but it doesnt add much to her defense and frey will need a strong defense when she is brought before the nowcrazed tanta to face an unexpected trial of her alleged crimeswe got to see

Guerrilla Games,we inching closer to horizon forbidden west february release date up until now guerrilla games has kept much about the narrative under lock and key but the latest trailer which you can view above is full of teases for aloy next adventure it provided glimpses at some returning characters alongside new faces who are sure to shake up aloy journey for better or worseguerrilla left fans with a lot to dissect and unpack in this new showing thankfully we chatted with narrative director benjamin mccaw and senior writer annie kitain to gain more clarity and context about what we sawthe trailer reiterated the tremendous plight in front of aloy the land is dying people are suffering and soon they starve aloy says as a deadly storm makes its presence known in the background and the machines meant to help us are out of control apparently the forbidden west holds the answer to aloy saving the world but it also hides great dangers as a new face named kotallo puts it in the west war is the rule peace the exceptionthe trailer makes no qualms about a rebel leader and her dark side named regalla she introduced to us with a brutal fighting style and even harsher words to describe her regalla seeks to slaughter all those who have wronged her and will kill anyone who gets in her wayshe deadly kitain says she has this army of machines and rebels and she really is driven by this hatred for the carja tribe she bent on this sort of destruction towards that tribe and she really willing to basically burn the world down to get the vengeance that she wantswhen we asked if regalla would be one of aloy primary antagonists mccaw says absolutely aloy going to fight regalla forces throughout the game and she will fight regalla as wellmccaw also revealed thatesteemed hollywood actressangela bassett black pantherwhat love got to do with it malcolm xportrays regallabut perhaps the real kicker about regalla is the trailer revelation that she answers to a higher power who supplied her with troops weapons and even the ability to control machines and then it pans to wandering researcher sylens who zero dawn players know all too wellthis isn the first confirmation we had that sylens would be back as he made an appearance in previous forbidden west trailers however this is the first hint we had at the role he play in the game and it not looking too good as he directly involved with a rebel tribe the latest trailer confirms he the one giving regalla a lot of her power we asked guerrilla to share more on sylens relationship with regallaas for how regalla connected to sylens sylens is always somewhat of a mystery and full of secrets kitain says we know from zero dawn he was helping aloy but now in the forbidden west he definitely has his own agenda and while a lot of that is something we look forward to players discovering part of that is arming regalla and her rebels with this ability to control machines why and what those connections are that something that aloy will discoverthe latest trailer touches on that aspect as we hear aloy say whatever secrets he has he keeping to himself and it appears she talking about sylens in that regard from horizon zero dawn we know aloy relationship with sylens has been complicated and anything can happen as he proven himself to be a wildcardif you played zero dawn you might have noticed a few familiar faces in the trailer particularly erend and varl guerrilla games confirmed in our cover story interviews that part of aloy journey will be realizing she can save the world alone and that her relationships are of the utmost importancealoy built some connections in zero dawn but guerrilla is bringing back some characters for her to get to know on a deeper level both erend and varl will play a significant role in the game and are among aloy first companions as she heads west the amount of time you spend with particular companions will be affected by your particular playthrough mccaw says but we can confirm that varl and erend are people that you encounter pretty early in the game and you spend a lot of time with themguerrilla has talked a lot about bringing back erend for forbidden west but this is the first extensive glimpse we had at varl varl at the end of horizon zero dawn he like many others in the nora tribe sees aloy as the anointed a figure from their religious beliefs kitain says so he feels this duty to help her just from that angle but more than that he someone who got to know her in zero dawn and he really worried about her as a person and the burden that she faces as she heads out into the forbidden westwhile it nice to see some old friends part of every adventure is meeting new people and aloy will have her share of new allies in the forbidden west guerrilla was happy to dish on some of the new faces from the trailer pictured above is kotallo a fierce and loyal warrior from the tenakth tribe kitain teased that his story is very personal and closely tied to aloy own journey the next new character we spot is alva who comes from a mysterioustribe aloy will encounter alva appeared in one of our cover story demos to which mccaw described her as bright and curious but a little unsure of herself last we see zo who hails from the utaru tribe she a grave singer and she has a bit of a tragic past kitain saysthe ending of the trailer left a strong impression with gaia confirmed by guerrilla imparting these words to aloy we will find the answers but be aware we not the only ones who seek them the shot then focuses on a new character donning white and gold guerrilla identified her as tilda and beloved actress carrieanne moss the matrix momento brings her to life she is a mysterious and complicated character with a special connection to the ancient past kitain says she someone who we look forward to players unraveling the secret of what she all aboutfeeling a little overwhelmed by all the returning faces for zero dawn don be guerrilla says the team went out of the way to ensure the sequel was newcomerfriendly and had plenty of callbacks for fans that was something that we were really conscious of when we were working on the story kitain says we wanted to make sure that fans from the first game come into this and recognize the characters they see aloy as they remember her but also growing but we also wanted to make sure that new players could come into this and get up to speedhowever if you want to refresh your memory on some characters before the game mccaw and kitain gave us the ones to focus on to brush up on varl erend and talanah would be a good start mccaw says but to reiterate it not needed we going to tell you everything you need to know to play this game if you a beginnerkitain also adds that talanah story from the recent horizon comics will continue into forbidden west you don need to read the comics because one of our goals is that you are brought up to speed she says but if you have you kind of have that extra knowledge of like okay i know what they talking about and i experienced that part of her journey in the comics and now see how that plays out in the forbidden westwant more on horizon forbidden west check out our

old should your children be when introducing them to video games what are the best titles to teach them how to use a controller are there games that both a youngster and adult will find equally enjoyableas a father of a nineyearold daughter i get asked these questions frequently by people with children of their own and i always stumble with my response as i try to recall the route i took to acclimate her to games most kids want to play games at an early age yet there arent many resources out there that help parents and guardians find a safe and rewarding gaming path for their kiddos i hope this new reoccurring all ages section helps people find solutions to their childrens gaming needsthis months section focuses on teaching kids how to use a controller first the games that accomplish this task also help them navigate and spacesill offer suggestions for cooperative games the best nonviolent options genre entry points and more in the months ahead if you have questions or want to explore specific topics drop me a letter at reiner with your thoughtsmy efforts to get my daughter into the console gaming space were not easy her frustrations with using a controller for the first time were made worse by the fact that a good number of licensed childrens games are downright awful and dont appear to take their targeted age group to heart that said we found a handful of games that are fantastic entry points heres where to startim guessing most of you have visions of your child playing one of your alltime favorite games as their first just know that that playthrough wont go well at the age of three or four but it will make for a great photo that you can cherish forever once you get the pictures out of the way i recommend docking a switch to your tv and having your childs first game be super mario maker for years i suggested parents try the original super mario maker with their kids delivering results many of these kids developed the base skills needed to open the doors to the entire gaming worldwhy did i choose the mario maker series over the other more popular mario games most video games are violent even kids games nintendos historic mario franchise is viewed as one of the best familyfriendly series out there but it too is violent the plumber uses his boots to squash turtles and torches other critters with fireballs mario also plummets to his death and his battles against bowser are always intense with super mario maker you can remove all of that violence and create the perfect starter experience for your child thats the rub though you have to make it yourself using the games creation tools you can create levels free of both violence and death no enemies no pitfalls just simple running and jumping exercises from left to right these stages teach your kid how to run jump and use items in safe and fun ways with a deep well of creative options you can essentially create an endless number of stages that help your child learn how to use a controller given marios simplicity just a couple of buttons are used and you have the choice of either the analog stick or directional pad your youngster should get the hang of the gameplay reasonably quickly and will be ready to move on to other games in a matter of days or weekstaking the controller from your child to show them how to do something can lead to frustration on their end the better approach is to be in the game world with them where you can communicate and use your character to show them the moves ibb obb from developer sparpweed is a great example of how this can work it also serves as a nice continuation of marios sidescrolling gameplay within puzzlebased levels that you and your kiddo will have to solve together the first of the ibb obbs puzzles are easy to solve and dont require much in terms of dexterity the game gets harder and more complicated as it goes but by then your child should be well versed in the movements and thinking requiredibb obb can currently be played on pc and switch it delivers light violence in the form of enemy obstacles but is fairly safe in that regard after spending time with this game your child should be ready for the more mature platformers like super mario world and yoshis crafted worldstaying on the theme of switch the allaround best machine for kids and families mario kart deluxe is a fantastic entry point into exploring space this is another game that you can play together but you wont necessarily have a hand in guiding your childs movements dont worry the game does that for you through options called smart steering and autoaccelerate which are on by default the game essentially plays itself your child can freely manipulate their racers movement and speed but should they get stuck the game will autocorrect for them when they stop pressing buttonswith a wide roster of characters from other wellknown nintendo franchises mario kart deluxe is a nice conversation starter that gives you a moment to talk to your child about the legend of zelda splatoon donkey kong and animal crossing games planting the seed about these toptier franchises is a good thing as youll likely play them in a couple of yearsminecraft is another excellent entry point into threedimensional worlds as it allows you to create a safe environment for you and your child to interact with the controls are rather complex however and onboarding can take time with my daughter our first month of playing minecraft together consisted of her having limited input we made a zoo together i handled the construction of the facilities and she figured out which animals would go into the habitats i filled her inventory with eggs that spawn animals we would run around the world open doors and place animals where she felt they belonged after a month she tested her hand at building and within a matter of weeks was a wiz at it being able to create elaborate houses and structures with easedo the kids enjoy wheres waldo books if you dont mind getting fingerprints on your tv hidden through time offers a similar interactive experience you can either hand the controller over to your kid to find their own secrets or have them point to what they want you to interact with on the tv the levels in hidden through time grow in size change historical themes and have plenty to look at making for a spirited time sleuthing with the little onesone of the most relaxing cooperative games ive ever played is a simulator called farm together released on switch pc and playable on xbox and playstation consoles farm together is a great option for kids that may teach them a thing or two about counting and money management but dont read into that as a roadblock kids can freely plant crops build houses and emote away without worry of finances farm together has no fail states and is all about having fun with family and friends up to players can be on the same farm working on it together during the pandemic farm together has been a wonderful way to connect with other families for some game timemost of best video games for kids lists i see online recommend pokmon and animal crossing both of these options require children to be fluent readers i would avoid both of them until your child is roughly seven or eight years of age if you play them before they can read the experience will likely be miserable with your kid holding the controller youll have to sit over their shoulder and read all of the text that appears on screen i tried this with my daughter and it didnt go well the look of boredom on her face said enough and her tapping the button to skip the text i was trying to read made the game practically unplayable your best move is to avoid having a bad taste associated with these beloved franchises and wait a few years until your little one is old enough to readi would also hold off on roblox for reading purposes but also due to the uncertainty that comes from trying out new games there are thousands to choose from most created by the roblox players themselves and you never know what you will get yes robloxs visuals scream of kids but it isnt a fully curated experience for children and there are many pitfalls that they can be subjected to like inappropriate adultthemed content microtransactions and player abuse for roblox id wait until your child is six or seven and youll want to be around to monitor the gaming sessions until you feel comfortable letting your child play unsupervisedone of the big challenges parents face is sheltering their children from specific themes and violence a disney movie could suddenly turn disturbing or a birthday present from a relative could produce a nerf blaster or lego set filled with swords and guns its hard to avoid all forms of violence especially in video games if you dont mind the cartoon variety tt games longrunning lego series is fantastic for cooperative play theres a steep learning curve for controller input such as holding down or rapidly tapping a specific button within a set period of time but the experiences are always fun and rewarding id avoid lego worlds given the content is fairly confusing i highly recommend starting with lego marvel superheroes lego harry potter and any of the star wars titles speaking of lego star wars the skywalker sagas release is right around the corner and could be a great jumpingon point for your family,en,643.0,Positive

before you start aloys next journey lets dive insome games dont require you to play the previous title before jumping into the followup and though the developer states you can enjoyhorizon forbidden

unfamiliar terrain both physically as she explores new landscapes on her westward trek and psychologically as she deals with the side effects of her newfound fame aloy travels to the titular forbidden

time for the payoff for years bungie has teased the potential of destinys most devious villain in recent months that tease has escalated the hive queen named savathn has infiltrated all the major storylines insinuating herself into the events shaping the story now at long last the witch queens trap is sprung as she coopts humanitys most precious resource the light that gives power to its guardians and uses that power to make deathless warriors of her ownwith the witch queen bungie is betting big on a narrative twist thats been in the making for a long time and using that storytelling moment to push forward new twists on the longestablished gameplay model including a dramatic move toward playstyle customization for players on the eve of the expansions release we spoke with the projects creative director and got the scoop on what longtime players lapsed guardians returning to the fold and even newcomers can expect to discover in the next few monthsthe villain savathn the most cunning hive foe that weve ever had is front and center says creative director james tsai and it would not be a savathn story if there were no trickery she is the god of cunning that focus on treachery hidden meanings and secrets doesnt end because savathn has now revealed her true identity and stepped into the light and it sounds like a primary focus of the witch queen experience is matching wits against such a wily foe weve actually been talking about this as a mystery tsai continues the player fantasy is one of being like a psychic detective this time around youre going into this uncertain destination this creepy beautifully grotesque twisted wonderland kind of place whats the mystery here what can you trustthose dynamics of beautiful grotesquerie are on full display in the playspace that tsai is describing savathns throne world is a sprawling new area for players to explore filled with secrets and opportunities for combat across several distinct regions a reflection of savathns mind the throne world is an old hive realm that is being remade and blessed by the light that savathn has stolen she has the light so she has this opulent wellmanicured castle cool sculptures courtyards its not the typical hive area then you have this swampier bayou kind of area that she has not yet rebuilt with the light and then theres this underworld section as well theres even a new sixperson matchmade activity called wellspring that plays out in the throne world built to convey the fantasy of storming the seemingly insurmountable castle conceptually the swamps heat and humidity represent something novel and distinct from what weve previously seen from the franchiseacross that new landscape bungie has big plans to make the new campaign especially memorable we call it the definitively destiny campaign tsai says its about bringing some of the awesome grandeur of some of our endgame aspirational feel into the campaign itself soaring through these really cool environmental setpieces memorable encounters that take a lot of thought and understanding bringing puzzles into the campaign for players theres a really reinvigorated focus on the campaign in this releasethe campaigns renewed importance also means new ways to play beyond the classic experience players can confront a legendary version of the campaign that translates into more enemies with more significant health pools increased modifiers on combat and tweaks to darkness zones that ensure players cant trivialize encounters in return players can expect commensurate rewards with gear bundles that help push your guardian into raidreadiness upgrade modules and even the possibility of exotic dropsthe legendary campaign also features a new approach to fireteam size adapting content and enemies depending on the number of guardians in your playgroup our intent is to make sure that there is no wrong way to play this tsai says you want to play it by yourself youre doing it you want to play with friends youll get the same tough experience and that same accomplishmentwhether in classic or legendary difficulty players should expect one significant challenge to remain constant the dire threat of the lucent brood while players will still face the entire coterie of hive enemies theyve fought for years savathns forces are joined by new variants empowered by the light like player character guardians the lucent brood wield supers and rise back from the dead after defeat it really does change the sandbox experience against them tsai says its not just like fighting a set of hive with new pajamas you have to take these abilities into considerationplayers can expect to confront newly empowered knights glowing with void shields like a titan arcpowered wizards fling out electrical attacks and solarfueled acolytes wield fans of flaming knives upon death these highthreat enemies remain dormant for a few seconds until their ghosts bring them back to life and full health ready to continue the fight your only option is to risk closing the distance to the enemy ghost and then tapping your finisher to grasp and crush them ending the threatmeanwhile more standard hive enemies will get powered up by moths that infuse them with light so you might fight an acolyte who is charged with light and when you defeat that acolyte then the moth comes flying out and it seeks to infuse its power into another one of the nearby combatants or it comes after you and tries to detonate tsai explains add up the implications and battles against the lucent brood aim for highintensity encounters that require upclose confrontations to end the fight definitivelyto increase your chance of survival guardians have a few new tricks of their own the glaive appears in both exotic and legendary varieties and acts as a combo melee and ranged weapon with significant potential for destruction its our first new weapon archetype in the game since bows and its the only firstperson melee weapon we have tsai says unlike the sweeping arcs of swords the glaive is squarely targeted at single foe engagement aggressive jabs can be strung together with multiple button presses to produce a fluid combo a glaive can also shoot out an energy blast at short or medium range and features a defensive shield that powers up as you defeat enemiesglaives are just one of the many weapons you can build and tweak with the new weapon crafting system this complex new system fulfills a desire many destiny players have voiced for years a chance to devise their own custom arsenals modifying weapons to support a personal playstyle weapon crafting starts with a pattern which can be used to create the initial form of a given weapon using that weapon in combat gains levels that enable you to further tweak its capabilities from intrinsic properties like a ranged or handling increase to magazine attributes and other more consequential adjustments eventually youll be able to alter its core traits and perks like rampage or killing wind youre also gathering crafting resources both through distinct sources out in the game world as well as by dismantling other weapons optional consumable mementos even let you unlock cosmetic changes to your weaponsall of these weapon changes are enabled through the use of the relic both to create and subsequently customize your perfect tool of destruction its a new focus for investment in the game and personalization of your experience and its treated as such a designated place you visit that features numerous options for making a given weapon your own the reason we have this relic is that we wanted this to feel like a personal sacred and emotionally intimate moment for you and give it some importance in the universe tsai saysthe witch queen is also set to see a further push toward play customization through revising the void subclasses that retrofit is the first such reorganization of lightbased subclasses planned for the year with both arc and solar intended for rollout in later seasons to get a sense of what to expect look no further than the recent launch of the darknessbased stasis powers with their aspects and fragments that let players reshape their approach to play when applied to the void classes players shouldnt expect entirely new power arrays instead its about mixing and tweaking the existing power trees to buildcraft the exact character you want we really feel it is a big quality of life improvement for those light subclasses being able to just optimize the way that you play tsai saysafter a significant delay that pushed the witch queen into the new year destiny players have high expectations for a refresh that invigorates the longrunning hobby game while the full scope of that refresh wont be apparent until weeks into the new expansion its safe to say that bungie has a clear plan ahead for continued evolution after all the witch queen is just the first in a line of named expansions already in the books but before that final shape can coalesce the complete picture of savathns deceptions and trickery must come to light and those developments have the attention of a rapt fanbasecheck out the gallery below

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/10/assassins-creed-valhalla-dawn-of-ragnarok-preview-myths-and-powers,Assassin's Creed Valhalla: Dawn Of Ragnarok Preview – Myths And Powers,we got the first few details of assassins creed valhalla dawn of ragnarok a couple of months ago alongside news of the games odyssey crossover the sprawling long expansion follows eivor in the guise of odin through the dwarven realm svartalfheim which has recently been invaded battling through the magmainfused muspels and iceencrusted jotnar odin seeks to defeat the fire giant surtr to save the kidnapped god baldrwith one month left until dawn of ragnarok is set to release we got a handsoff look at the expansion the distinctively mythological adventure aims to be a unique experience the expansion will refresh the experience of the main game and will expand the viking fantasy going deep into the norse mythology says producer mariana gosteva hopefully this will give fans of the nearly twoyearold game a reason to pick up the controller againin our preview we started fittingly with a leap of faith from the top of a massive dwarven statue the green landscape below looked deceptively ordinary until the camera pannedup at a mountain laced with gold behind it is a sky brimming with the branches of yggdrasil the player can choose to make odin male or female in dawn of ragnarok but no matter your decision odin doesnt have much time for exploration the jotnar and muspel have already spread across svartalfheima new boar mount appears decorated with a complicated web of norse patterns ready to take the god to a nearby shelter filled with dwarves seeking refuge from invading forces shelters dot the map acting as a hub for players looking to shop upgrade their gear or pick up quests among these upgradable items is the hugrrip a powerful piece of equipment specific to this expansion that allows odin to take on powers from various enemiesseparate and more impressive than skills or abilities the five powers in dawn of ragnarok allow odin to perform otherworldly feats to activate these powers you have to build up a special bar by gathering hugr one interesting way to do this is to stop at a shrine of yggdrasil sacrificing a hefty amount of odins health to the world tree in return for the needed energy in the preview we first see these powers in action while odin searches the city of uldar a dwarven mining city now overrun by muspelsuldar sits nestled up to a mountainside glittering with gold and has one main entrance preceded by a long bridge to avoid being spotted by defending enemies odin kills a large bird grabbing the power of the raven from it this lets the god take the creatures form and fly over the unsuspecting town but you cant fly forever powers only last for so long as shown by a timer in the bottom right so be careful time doesnt run out as youre soaring through the skytheres also a strategic element to acquiring these powers though you can pick powers up from most foes scattered throughout levels odin can only hold two at a time as the preview continues we see odin find the power of muspelheim which allows players to transform into a fiery muspel in this form muspels wont attack you hostile creatures will stop fighting if you transform midfight and you can also walk on lava however an enemy soon appears in the demo with the power of rebirth which reanimates defeated foes to fight for you because odin already has the power of the raven and the power of muspelheim the player has to choose which power to keep so the question becomes do you want a temporary undead army the ability to fly or lavawalkingfighting the citys hordes also offers us a chance to check out a new weapon and enemy type fans that dive into dawn of ragnarok will be able to add an atgeir a viciouslooking twohanded weapon to their arsenal this comes in handy against otherworldly opponents like the flamekeepers in the muspel ranks this formidable new foe has the vexing ability to resurrect defeated enemies summon an everflowing stream of exploding minions and take a meaty chunk out of you in melee combatas a special part of the demo game informer got a glimpse of dawn of ragnaroks valkyrie arena its narrative conceit is interesting each fight is framed as a reenactment of one of odins heroic battles a tale played out in combat performed for the valkyrie kra and the warriors of valhalla to inspire them to train hard for ragnarok and like in any good story the player has the option to sprinkle a few boasts into the mix that means mechanically speaking players entering the arena can choose to apply different challenges to the fightfor instance we saw a boast called ability tradeoff which makes foes attacks stronger after youve used an ability and another called enemy stun resistance while we only saw two in the demo you can apply up to boasts per combat picking different boasts for each fight not only varies your encounters but also impresses the valkyrie more resulting in a bigger rewardplayers can spend the tokens of kra at her shop explains gosteva there they can acquire new gear and weapons as well as awesome new cosmetic items they will also be able to purchase some of the new odin runes as well as upgrade materialsbut dawn of ragnarok isnt all about fighting the preview event also showed off the games exploration elements this includedsome of the locations of big quests like hreidmar palace where glod the son of the giant surtr dwells however getting there provedchallenging as the palace towers above the landscape on a rock so tall it dwarfs the surrounding mountains the power of the raven wasespecially helpful here but side content wasalso filled with exploration opportunities including puzzles with tempting rewardswe saw for example hreidmars groft an underground cave filled with fire and ice which hides an armor piece the team showed off the fourth and final power of the demo here called power of jotunheim like power of muspelheim it transforms you into a mythical creature but this time a frost giant the power also includes the ability to teleport you can move short distances by dodging or rolling but you can also move longer distances if you shoot an arrow at world knots by using the power of jotunheim and muspelheim back and forth youll be able to delve into the heart of the cave here waiting in a locked chest is a piece of the dwarven blacksmith armor set one of five new sets coming in the expansionassassins creed valhalla dawn of ragnarok releases march on playstation and xbox consoles as well as stadia pc and amazon luna you can start the expansion by heading to the seer in ravensthorpe and while the team recommends players reach power level for the adventure dont worry if youre new to the game or dont want to wait to jump in underpowered players will get a boost when they enter the dwarven realm,en,535.0,Positive

and stepping into the role isnt an easy decision sometimes its done out of necessity while other times it comes down to a persons honor and virtue in some instances even greed and fanfare drive these desires no matter the reasoning it takes great confidence and courage to take up the mantle and sometimes finding those attributes is what makes a heros journey so interestingfrey holland voiced by actress ella balinska charlies angels is the lead protagonist of forspoken for the most part frey is an ordinary young woman but when she mysteriously gets transported from her home in new york to the magical land of athia she has to dig deep to find not only herself but also the strength to save this suffering world from the breaka malevolent arcane fog which has corrupted people animals and the land for our recent cover story we chatted with luminous productions about how frey came to life and she isnt your typical textbook hero read on to learn more about what to expect when you step into her shoeswhen luminous productions set out to create its leading character for forspoken the writers were tasked with crafting a flawed and believable character someone who felt very human when we meet frey she isnt benevolent and worried about others says writer allison rymer shes been knocked down every which way and is barely scraping by we get to join her on a path of selfdiscoveryfrey spent her early years in the foster care system and has had to grow up fast fending for herself in new york city when were introduced to her shes at a really low point in her life and feels very alone with only her cat homer at her side for companionship growing up in hells kitchen has been rough says writer todd stashwick she feels no one has her back shes tough and has been running as fast as she can in new york for her and homerthe scars from her past havent faded and rymer says her backstory plays greatly into her identityfor frey growing up in the foster system hasnt been all bad but it did leave her with a feeling of low selfworth and strong desire to fit in and have a family which shes yet to find she sayswith no one to turn to except homer frey is not making the best decisions in her life trailers have heavily hinted she may be on her way to prisonlike any human she is making her share of mistakes andmany times you wont see her say or do the right thing shes a good person but in these desperate times she has put herself in bad circumstances stashwick explains she may have hit a point of no return physically and emotionally frey at this breaking point has put herself on trialinternally judging her own life and direction we extend that metaphor into her story and external situations so that the hero can rise she needs to start in a less than heroic placeat her lowest frey just wants out of her current life but rymer reminds us as the old adage goes be careful what you wish for soon she is mysteriously transported to the fantastical and medievallooking athia where shes imbued with magical powers facing off against evil sorceresses and dragons shes also unaffected by the breaks corruption something shell discover the reasoning to as she goes on her journey nonetheless it gives her a special upper hand in saving this world but shes not so quick to jump on board with helping similar to dorothy in the wizard of oz she just longs to go homestashwick calls it a connecticut yankee in king arthurs court type of story but even with such a big change of scenery and a lot of turmoil to distract her frey cant escape her problems from new york stashwick points to the clash between the grounded modern sensibilities of frey and the fantastical world of athia in particular freys feelings of abandonment and insecurities follow her from new york into athia he says so even though there are wonderous landscapes magic and dragons she is processing and meeting it with all of her personal issues she is acclimating to her new reality and enhanced abilitiesfrey may have the power to cast magic but shes not certain shes ready to have a whole worlds fate on her shoulders nobody ever stuck their neck out for her so whyshould she jump to help a group of people she knows nothing about while theres something inviting about the beauty of athia its also downright dangerous and holds plenty of darkness adding to her uncertainty anddesire to leaveshes also feeling everything on a much more amplified level in this strange land athia is also a very grounded fantasy realmstashwick says the conditions are harsh the human drama and problems are just as real as in new york even if the circumstances are heightened the stakes now for frey are more than just her own problems its life or death for a lot of peoplea lot of the journey will be frey growing into the role of hero and overcoming her own demons frey isnt totally onboard to be athias knight in shining armor from the getgo rymer says for starters shes not so sure she wants to do the job or is even capable of it secondly there are some athians who would agree with her but as she gets to know some of the people there she realizes they might just be worth fighting for and with her powers she might just be their only hopewith so much on her shoulders frey will try to get by any way she can and humor is often her weapon against the giant plight before her both stashwick and rymer point to humor as a way people often cope with situations as a way to deflect from the pain to them it felt truthful to give frey quips as she contends with the worlds overthetop moments in order to realistically portray a modern woman who has found themselves in such an absurd situation it was natural that some of her reactions would be humorous stashwick further explains to selfconsciously avoid anything funny would have been a disservicerymer is quick to add that while freys humor is one of her weapons against athias darkest days she cant use it against everything and it surely wont save athia from peril its like armor humor protects her keeps her safe from feeling icky emotions like they bounce right off but yeah when s gets real freys weapon is rendered useless a joke or two cant protect her anymore she has to deal with whats happening headon and it wont be easyfrey will face adversity from some unexpected places for her conflicts stashwick teases a hells kitchen gang the new york legal system the council of athia the evil tantas her own selfdoubt freaky beasts and a dragonfrey will also face xenophobia rymer adds she is an outsider in athia some people will welcome her but others who feel threatened by her wont frey will also struggle with her own insecurities shes prone to put up walls and push people awayin forspoken fantasy and reality collide because they have to in order for frey to become the woman she needs to be in her life while casting big magical attacks and leaping through a fairytalelike world should hold much of the excitement theres something to be said about watching a character become a different version of themselvesduring our interviews with the writers its clear theyre making a genuine attempt to say something about the human condition as rymer saysthrough freys eyes we wanted to tell a story about humanity how even in the bleakest of times there can still be hope and kindness and sometimes it takes a little help to see that sometimes it takes being thrown into a strange new worldfreys cat homer is her only family and that love between the two was instantly apparent in trailers not only did the pairs bond pull at viewers heartstrings but homer quickly stole the spotlight the writers promised us theyd never let anything happen to homer saying her role is much more about the love she brings into freys lifefreys relationship with homer is really important says writer allison rymer they have an unconditional love homer has been there for her through it all and vice versa frey would do anything for homer their relationship sets the groundwork for the kind of love and respect that frey yearns forwriter todd stashwick agrees about homers importance saying homer is the only thing that frey feels needs her giving her a small sense of purpose and to that she in turn needs homer her relationship to homer actually mirrors bigger important ideas and themes in the gameweasked abouthomers connection tothe famed ancient greek poet who composed theiliad and odyssey and if that connection plays into the games themes stashwick coyly responds freys odyssey begins,en,618.0,Positive

The Blue Blur Back To the Silver Screen,the first sonic the hedgehog film was an unlikely success story following a disastrous debut trailer in which the iconic blue hedgehog looked far removed from his appearance in every other form of media the studio went back to the drawing board instead of discouraging the filmmakers the backlash motivated director jeff fowler and the rest of the team to pay more attention to the enthusiastic fan basethey were absolutely right to request us to work harder and to make adjustments fowler says and then to come out the other side and for everyone to be able to high five and celebrate it felt like we ended in a place where they were happy and the film was a film that they could embrace now moving forward it just feels like we have this really wonderful relationship with the fansthe result was a character design that looked much more like the sonic fans are familiar with and the box office numbers reflected an appreciative audience with the first film raking in more than million worldwide the authenticity fowler and his team delivered in response to the fans paid offpart of that equation included actors who provided authentic performances for the brands biggest characters jim carrey dumb and dumber the mask delivered an allin performance as dr robotnik ben schwartz parks and recreation house of lies is a lifelong fan so sliding into the role of voicing sonic the hedgehog was a dream come true however to find his performance as sonic he intentionally didnt study any of the other interpretations of the characterwhen i read the script to me sonic felt like this kid this really energetic kid schwartz says i didnt really look at the other performances so i took it from the movie script because i didnt want to feel like i was copying anything but in my head i was like i want him to have heart i want him to be excited i want him to feel like a kid and i want him to be funny i want him to deflate any situation that feels too big for him with a joke because hes been through a lot of stuff so thats kind of how hes lived his lifein the first film sonic finds tom a human fatherfigure character played by james marsden westworld xmen while marsden has a long history of prominent roles acting alongside a virtual character has been a new experience for himive worked with actors where the animated hedgehog whos not there is more animated than the person im acting opposite marsden says laughing its a different skillset youre on set and youre sitting in a rowboat having a hearttoheart with your son and hes not there its just a voice from behind the camera somewhere it definitely takes a little bit of your imaginationin sonic the hedgehog moviegoers are introduced to silverscreen versions of tails and knuckles voiced by colleen oshaughnessey sonic boom sonic forces and idris elba the wire the suicide squad respectively like carrey elba provides alist star power but oshaughnessey grants additional authenticity thanks to her long tenure voicing tails in the games and recent tv seriesoshaughnessey thought her appearance as tails in the first movies credits scene would be a oneanddone situation and never expected to join the main cast i had no idea where this would go i had no idea how excited people would be to see it she says people sent me videos of their theaters exploding in joy i knew people liked tails but i had no concept of how that reaction was going to gosonic the hedgehog recreates multiple iconic scenes from the games the snowboard scene in the trailers is reminiscent of games like sonic and sonic adventure but fowler loves the climax of the second sonic game tails flying the tornado delivering sonic into battle on the biplane its such an iconic image from sonic he says to be able to do the bigscreen cinematic version of that it gave all of us goosebumps and got us so excitedschwartz agrees that sonic the hedgehog delivers plenty of fanservice and nods to iconic moments from the games but he also has a list of other game moments hed love to make the jump to liveaction oh my goodness in sonic the casino zone is pretty amazing he excitedly says but there is this zone in sonic mania though i guess it wouldnt make sense because were a film but in sonic mania theres this incredible zone thats all about movies and zapping you from a tv to a different tv i was blown away by how amazing all that stuff was im a big sidescroller guy because thats what i came up with sonic has so many things id love to put in there sonic mania has a similar fun vibesonic the hedgehog is in theaters now but dont think that once you see it thats the end of the sonic saga a third film has already been greenlit by paramount pictures as has a liveaction show starring knuckles for paramount plus when you add a midcredits scene for sonic the hedgehog that sets the table for the next entry in an exciting manner the future of the liveaction sonic franchise looks brightfor more onsonic the

secrets to look for as you traverse the lands between youll want to check back in a few days for some ways to find some hidden areas and bosses today well walk through some strategies to get the most out of your exploration in the vast open world and legacy dungeons that youll experience on your journey and explain how some of the more nebulous overarching concepts work obviously if youre looking to head into the incredible world of elden ring completely spoilerfree this is the time to stop readinggod runes how do they workwhen you defeat one of the shardbearing demigods of elden ring youll acquire their god rune however in order to activate it you will also have to locate and climb a divine tower in the associated region depending on the demigod these could be very easy to find in the surrounding territory and easy to locate on the map however some of the demigod towers are tucked quite out of the way and require considerable exploration to discover you may even have to delve into some of the smaller dungeons to find a route once you climb a divine tower and activate the god rune you can then use a rune arc to activate its associated powers which could include life leech a massive boost to hp buffs to all your stats and more these buffs confer considerable power but expire upon death yes that makes them somewhat similar in execution to embering in dark souls iii however you have more choice in which buff to apply if you find yourself in need of rune arcs rats drop them fairly frequently and they can be purchased from a variety of characters in the worldhow to obtain boss weapons and armorokay so youve managed to take on one of the big bosses now you want to wear their armor and maybe pick up their weapons or signature spells whats an adventurer to do head over to the roundtable hold theres an open room you may not have checked out before here you can cash in your boss souls for special weapons and spells as well as purchase complete armor sets for runes now what if you want more than one boss weapon or spell to round out your ensemble because you only get one token from the boss right heres what you do head out into the open world and find one of the giant bellringing stone monstrosities that walk the land hop on torrent and clean off their feet by whacking the skulls off be careful because they can and will absolutely crush you if they step on you once cleaned the giant ponderous beasts will stay still and allow you to climb inside here you can make a copy of a boss token so that you can get additional turnins or just crush them for additional runes enjoylight is mightthe early journey into limgrave may find you using torches to see in some of the darker caverns that dot the landscape however this is an annoying hindrance that takes up one of your hands instead make a point to seek out a lantern as early as possible which you can attach easily to your hip to light up any area handsfree this will be especially useful as you delve into lategame caves and other dark areas where youll need everything at your disposal there are several different locations to pick up a lantern but one can be found for purchase early on at the isolated merchants shack in the weeping penninsula in southern limgrave far to the west and on the coast this merchant also sells a ton of other useful stuff like stonesword keys so its a good place to dump some runes earlyupgrading your gear and summonsone of the most important things you can do in elden ring is to increaseyour weapon level standard weapons can be upgraded to and special weapons up to doing this requires special materials which you can often find in great abundance in mines around the world however you may find yourself in need of plenty of these mats especially since you are probably going to want to level up multiple weapons and experiment since you might run dry of a certain tier of upgrade material the best way to ensure your supply never runs dry is to keep doing the side dungeons around the world especially the mines by completing certain mines you will gain a bell bearing that you can turn in at the roundtable hold that will unlock various tiers of upgrade materials for purchase meaning you can take tons of weapons up to high levels without tracking down materials all day this also extends toward your array of summon spells as you can find bell bearings that will allow you to purchase ghostwort and the other essential materials for summon upgrades as well generally at the end of catacombs dungeons can figure out how to summon head to the church of ellah where there the doityourself blacksmithing forge and kale the vendor after you get torrent and the ability to level up and meet the new character there she give you the bell to take advantage of this featurekeeping your gear leveled up will ensure you can handle the challenges to come if youre a heavy melee build and dont have the mana pool to summon some of the coolest named summons dont fear too much there are a few summons that let you summon with your hp pool insteadswap arts and affinitieshave a really cool weapon but you dont like the special skill change it yes you can attach skills like quickstep to go full bloodborne to just about anything if you so desire this system is highly customizable but may seem daunting to work with at first you will discover tons of ashes as you progress and you can mix and match these to your weapons perhaps even more importantly you can change the nature of your weapons as well allowing them to scale differently or harder weapons in elden ring scale with your stats going a heavy dexterity build swap out your sword affinities and have it scale with heavy dex rather than say strength this system might be tough to understand at first but it allows for unparalleled customization opportunities heres a big plus if you dont feel like messing with this system you dont have to as many of the unique weapons in the game have their own special moves that cant be swapped or changed no problemgo somewhere elsea lot of players are trying to brute force challenging bosses down while you can definitely do this a more entertaining and rewarding option is to go explore i know this can seem obvious with the open world but sometimes you really get stuck in the old ways of just smashing your face against a boss again and again i mean that can be fun but go ride around even if you think youve completely explored an area and farmed it out for every scrap theres probably a portal or secret passage that could take you to another realm

everything and work on your flask of wondrous physick options one of your first goals should be to head out to eastern limgrave to the third church of marika and pick up the flask of wondrous physick this modular buffing tool grows over the course of the game as you unlock plentiful options usually from slaying erdtree bosses some of the more potent buffs you can stick in the flask allow you to basically soak up an entire hit for free and automatically heal when your health is low which are fantastic when going up against a tough boss perfumes and pots are incredibly handy in combat theres a perfume that allows you to soak up an entire blow combining that with the flask thats like two fully immune hits in a boss fight which can make life a lot easier and thats just scratching the surface

Valheim",imagine waking up to find the littleknown passion project you have been working on for years has rapidly become popular beyond your wildest expectations it the kind of success developers dream of but so few achieve even if a game has a fantastic story inventive mechanics and a unique style there is no guarantee it will prosper the competition is fierce with tons of games releasing every day and its a struggle to catch peoples attention and yet there are success stories of developers who managed to overcome all these hurdles and make unexpected sensations likedarkest dungeon stardew valley and valheim these games creators are unanimously grateful to their fans for giving them a shot and they acknowledge the creative freedom their success provides however they also spoke about the intense amount of work it is to maintain the next biggest hit as well as their struggles with doubt and finding purpose when moving on to new projectswhen asked about how they envisioned the future whenthey started their vancouverbased company in red hook studios cofounders chris bourassa and tyler sigman answered almost in unison we didnt the duo left their previous employers behind to launch the lovecraftinspired studio but as sigman explains it was always about the game it was never about the company the game hes referring to is darkest dungeon a gothic dungeoncrawling rpg where your partys mental status is just as vital as their physical one and though the project has now surpassed million copies sold and its hotly anticipated sequel recently entered early access on epic the first step to getting there wasnt what anyone would call glamorousit was three of us in a room in another studio that they were letting us borrow recalls bourassa there were rats in that building and human poop on the doorstep the first day we went to take possession as it were and i use that term in the broadest possible sense we would listen to the other studio argue sometimes explosively about games and we just kind of put our heads down and were trying to work awaysimilarly eric barone creator of stardew valley didnt begin by thinking about a development studio in fact he didnt even begin by thinking about a gameit started out as kind of a practice to get better at programming barone says talking about the earliest inception of his mega indie hit unable to land a job out of college he decided to increase his skill set by making a small title in the c programming language the initial plan barone explains was to make something he could put on his resume to impress possible employersemployment is no longer a concern for the developer stardew valley recently crossed the million units sold milestone with sales showing no sign of slowing down even years after the harvest moonlike farming simulatorfirst launched in but back in the early days of development it would have been difficult to guess that the training exercise would become a household nameit was very scrappy says baroneit was just me in the corner of our studio apartment on a cheap ikea desk and my budget computer just working on it it never crossed my mind to get an actual studio or anything like that especially because i was a completely solo developer its kind of a miracle that the whole thing came together because i really had no idea what i was doinghenrik trnqvist cofounder of iron gate studio which is making valheim a vikinginfluenced openworld game that stitches together basebuilding resource collecting life simulation survival exploration and bossbattling action vividly recalls having a tough time coming up with the studios name and navigating the paperwork required to get the company set up in however filing a mountain of forms and frustrating brainstorming sessions are a small price to pay for what became an almost overnight blockbustervalheim is still technically unreleased being an early access title but the sensation was already on the way to selling million copies last summer its development began in when richard svensson iron gates other cofounder started playing around with the norseinspired world impressed with the game and ready to move on from his previous employer trnqvist joined svensson a year after development began despite being confident in the games potential and having the backing of publisher coffee stain publishing trnqvist says honestly we were just developing the game we wanted to make and we were hopeful but realistic about the prospects of a lofi early access survival game made by mostly one person svensson we thought it would appeal and resonate strongly with a very niche audience but we had no idea it would resonate with millions of peopledarkest dungeons kickstarter campaign launched in and the developers watched in disbelief as the project flew past its goal in the first hours is this not the best of things bourassa asks when thinking about that time in the titles history the game that you care about has an audiencehe and his studio cofounder explain they were careful to keep a sense of perspective even as the pledges continued to pour in we didnt start losing our heads with fantasies of a massive sprawling game and a huge audience he says however bourassa did succumb to the immediate surge of joy at darkest dungeons later successful early access release at least for a momentit was the first time i kissed a man bourassa says in response his fellow founder sigman raises his hand declaring i received it the euphoria faded fast however sigman says the success changed it immediately from okay i think this game will have been worth doing and well be able to pay ourselves something to oh s we have a tiger by the tailthe first fruits of overwhelming success were hard to process for the valheim and stardew valley developers as well it was a bit of a blur exclaims trnqvist when asked about his reaction to valheim selling one million copies in its first week of early access at iron gate we were so focused on development and scaleproofing the game that it didnt really register i still dont think it really hason the other hand barone remembers stardew valleys surging popularity and the feeling that everyones talking about his game but his most dazzling memory from that time is meeting his inspiration yasuhiro wada who began the harvest moon series which then evolved into story of seasons mr wada the creator of harvest moon or his people reached out to me and he wanted to meet me barone says i mean that was one of many moments where my mind was blown and it really sank in as to how big this actually was that i had just achieved way beyond anything i had ever dreamed of and just being seen in the same kind of arena as harvest moon the game that inspired me to do all this was kind of mindblowing and im still kind of shocked and amazed by that in many waysparty poppers litter the floor and empty champagne glasses clutter tables but the teams dont rest after their triumphs actually their work grows more intense according to barone the time after launch was probably the busiest time of the entire fourandahalf years that it took to make the game echoing this sentiment trnqvist says we had so many incredible opportunities coming in and suddenly such a big community and trying to respond to everyone let alone move these opportunities along is a fulltime jobit took a few months for the darkest dungeon team to feel the change but with a game in early access where you build a title in full view of the community it was bound to come i think expectations and managing those expectations became much more of a clear and present danger during early access explains bourassa this shift came after players had put hours into darkest dungeon and began to hold opinions of their own on what the game should be and were much more conscious of having this really big player base and we want to do well by them says sigman but we also know that the way we got there was by being really true to our own sense of the vision so theres a little more weight now because you can anger million people overnightfor barone he remembers the public attention becoming conspicuous earlier on in stardew valleys development right after the project was greenlit on steam that was when the amount of attention increased a lot he recalls which of course can be kind of a shock and can be challenging when that happens especially for someone who has no prior experience and im a very solitary person in many ways im used to being kind of just in my own private bubble working but it was also exciting because i was thinking this game could actually be a successful gameafter his hit game was released barone found moving on more difficult than he expected i feel like my next game has to be better than stardew valley he explains because you know i want to be seen as someone whos getting better im improving the trajectory of my career is going up not stagnating or going down god forbidfor sigman at red hook darkest dungeons accomplishment also brought on an unexpected result it sounds funny to say sigman states but i think no matter how much you succeed its always easy to benchmark yourself against someone whos literally twice or three or five or ten times as successful its funny that your mind can create gnawing doubt no matter how fortunate you areeach project was staggeringly fortunate so much so that the valheim stardew valley and darkest dungeon teams could all afford to scale up their operations immediately after launch but they didnt trnqvist believes subtle adjustments and refinements have helped valheim continue to thrive weve grown with a couple of new additions but we took our time making sure the team is growing in the right direction and with the right people he saysiron gate recently passed a huge milestone by releasing valheims hearth home update the games fans had been waiting on the new content almost since the original early access release but the team found itself unable to work on it overwhelmed by the pressure that millions of unanticipated players placed on the core experience iron gate delayed its expansion spending months just keeping the base game stable theres always pressure to introduce big changes says trnqvist and add a bulk of new content and we will but we want to make sure that theres a good foundation there firsteven as red hooks sigman and bourassa discuss changes in the companys structure its clear the core of the studio the relationship between its cofounders has remained unaltered during our chat the two often finished each others sentences went off on goodnatured teasing tangents and even began chatting amongst themselves for long periods similarly unchanged from the companys early days the duo is still putting their project first we grew to make the game to make darkest dungeon ii the way we wanted to make it bourassa says we werent growing to fulfill an org chart so red hook as an entity continues to be second fiddle to the project itselfthats when the company became of value says sigman and we realized that to do this game we should hire more employees directly while the two needed to increase the team to tackle their next project the allure of the early days lingers its been a massive massive shift bourassa says its only something you can really perceive in hindsight i think because you add like one or two people and it still feels like a ragtag crew and then you turn around and realize youve added like just thinking of the stardew valley developer says sigman who didnt realize eric barone was talking with us for this article he could grow to a team size of if he wants probably with the cash flow hes generated but its a conscious choice of what you want to be and so we were like okay were gonna grow but were gonna still do one project right nowincidentally sigman isnt far off the mark regarding barones thoughts on expansion my original idea actually was that i would get a team and hand off stardew valley to them and then i would work on my next game but that didnt really pan out because i just realized really quickly that i was not going to be okay with just handing off the game to other people im very particular about stardew valley you know its my babythe first time barone worked with a team to develop any part of stardew valley was on an update that launched in it was definitely a big change for me barone says we got an office so i was going into a different place every day i was spending business hours with the other team members discussing with other people what we were going to do in the update it took a while to get used to it and then have a flow that worked i do think the update was a good update it was successful and it was kind of a good training for how to work with the team but i definitely think theres a part of me that loves working alone and having that responsibility for every aspect of the gameit is kind of difficult when you have achieved all of the goals that youd ever dreamed about barone says youre in this position of what do i do now why am i even making another game why am i doing thisthis seems to have been one of the biggest challenges facing the now wellknown developer who only started down this path to find a jobi dont want to just retire barone says i want to work it gives my life meaning but many of the factors that drove me to work so hard on stardew valley are now you can kind of check them all off i want to keep making games because i want to share my ideas with the world i want to create a legacy for myselfand thats exactly what he is doing barone has been working on two new titles one is concernedapes haunted chocolatier which recently caused a flurry of excitement when barone dropped an unexpected early gameplay video on social media haunted chocolatier is another completely solo game kind of like stardew valley where im doing literally everything he says that one will probably come out first his second game is a collaborative work which will give barone the ability to flex his muscles developing as part of a team working simultaneously as a lone developer on one project and with another developer on a second one has given him the best of both worldsdespite the freedom he has to pick his projects barone recognizes his first hit will follow him throughout his career im not trying to make the next big indie hit barone says i realize and appreciate that when my next game comes out im going to have a lot of people who play the game just because its from the guy who made stardew valley i was almost considering it might be interesting to release the game under an alias and people dont even know its me and then to see if it could actually just be successful on its own merits but i feel like thats a bit disingenuous im not going to do thatforthe valheim crew the focus is still on their early access title andthere is still plenty in the works for the game according to trnqvist the hearth home update was always meant to be the foundation we can build on with subsequent content updates with the mistlands updateour next major one but the process has taught us that big updates can snowball he says to combat that effect trnqvist and his team want to focus on gradual changesand less dramatic content drops that hit in between large expansionsred hooks cofounders have made more progress with their followup project than either barone or trnqvist darkest dungeon ii entered epic games store early access on october though the full release may still be some ways away while the sequel has mixed up the games art style and gameplay features sigman insists its also a darkest dungeon game im really excited about what we are doing in darkest dungeon ii you know like fleshing out and getting deeper into the heroes themselves weve had a chance to honestly improve in various ways like barone as he moves on to his next project bourassa also notes how important it was for red hook not to simply chase successwe could have just added metroidvania elements to the dungeons says bourassa recalling the earliest brainstorms for the sequel and called it darkest dungeon ii but it didnt feel like we could get as excited about that whats most important and the way we found success the first time was to channel our passion and excitement and our fear into this product so by taking the risks were actually delivering something closer to the feeling of the first game without delivering the exact same gamewhile the success of the studios first game certainly casts a long shadow sigman takes some comfort from it as well even if players dont take to the sequel in the same way he says at the end of the day nobody can take away darkest dungeon

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/04/08/updated-mlb-the-show-22-review-in-progress-now-with-switch-impressions,Updated: MLB The Show 22 – Review In Progress (Now With Switch Impressions),a few weeks ago spring annual crack of the bat was in question as mlb lockout dragged on the players and league eventually came to an agreement and the season was delayed slightly but no games will be lost as of this writing we are just a week away from the first pitch being thrown on april sony mlb the show series usually hits a few weeks in advance of the mlb season starting but this year installment hits the streets just two days before it on april for playstation playstation xbox series xs xbox one and for the first time on switchi just got my hands on the playstation xbox series x and switch versions and will be updating this story throughout the day and weekend with initial impressions of my time on the diamond sony is saying that the hitting pitching and fielding are improved and the audio commentary is coming from a different team players can also dive into a new online cooperative mode and can expect improvements in all of the series core avenues of play including franchise road to the show and diamond dynastyi beginning my impressions with the playstation version the first thing you see is a short video of shohei ohtani revealing more of his path into baseball after that for returning players you receive some rewards for coming back for another season here what i receivedbefore reaching the main menu you select your favorite team and then are given the option to enter a practice game to select which gameplay styles work for you i recommend going through this process to get a hang of the gameplay again and to figure out which pitching and batting systems you want to usethe new online coop mode is front and center on the main menu inviting players to play or this will be my first avenue of play you can see what this mode has to offer in the trailer belowwhen entering diamond dynasty before you can view anything you will first need to complete five missions as always the game gives you a default squad to work with here minethe first mission pits you against the new york yankees in the bottom of the ninth you are at the dish with runners on first and second in my instance i managed to send the first pitch over the right field wall to win the game and complete the mission i received two cards as a reward one of which is vinny castilla people who preordered the game get a fourday headstart on playing i had no problem finding a teammate for my first cooperative game we were greatly outmatched in terms of lineup before the action starts both players select a handful of cards from their collections to use during that game meaning you could use some legends you never earn on your own our opponents must have opened a few packs to have fernado tatis jr rickey henderson joe mauer giancarlo stanton and more jawdropping power in their lineupmatchmaking worked quickly teaming me with my teammate in seconds and finding opponents within to as you would expect in a game you and your teammate alternate at bats if someone gets on base the player not batting becomes the baserunner for the fielding one player pitches for an entire inning and controls the pitcher and catcher for that entire inning too meaning that this player handles steals and most bunts the other player fields any player can enter the pause menu to get the bullpen active if you are fielding your view is behind the pitcher until the ball is put in play allowing for you to get a good look at the pitch locations you just don see your teammate meterswe experienced a little latency in our game but it was mostly smooth we ended up netting hits to their five but two of their five were home runs we left the bases loaded twice in our nineinning game one scoring chance was squashed by a groundball that was hit up the middle into a shift the final score was we played our hearts out but it wasn enoughthe gameplay was nice and smooth but i didn see much that was visually different from last year that said it still a hell of a game every fielding animation fit to the moment player speeds seemed right both on the base paths and in the field and the pitchingbatting battle was as exciting as always i like that you can see the pci for your teammate to see just how close they came to squaring one uppack opening video above shows one of the packs i opened i still don have any players but i am only studs shy of a big dog pack which gives me one diamond player that is rare overall and base i digging the card designs this year especially those tied to the timed faces of the franchise program which ends in days faces of the franchise offers daily moments featured program moments legends and flashback missions and a final boss showdown xp for this battle passlike path can also come from standard games collections and exchangesthe only other program listed at launch gets you a babe ruth card at its conclusion this challenge simply asks that you complete one miniseason game and tally a number of basic baseball achievements like getting five hitsdiamond dynasty menus and avenues of play are again a bit overwhelming and hard to understand at first glance but deliver plenty of exciting paths for players to earn rewards in and spend plenty of timei took a glance at a few rosters and they are all as current as you would hope carlos correa is on the minnesota twins and marcus stroman is wearing his cubs pinstripes rookies who are promoted from the minors and outofleague signings like seiya suzuki are not yet in the game and must first play five innings before they can be added or be on any merchandise with that in mind you may want to hold off until the start of the real mlb season before starting franchise mode or any rosterbased activity the best avenue at play at this point is diamond dynastyand now for some bad news mlb the show is a graphical mess on switch these impressions are conducted on a switch oled in handheld mode from what i could tell all of the content is the same as the xbox and playstation iterations but the onthefield play struggles to run being brought down by both a chugging framerate and pronounced visual flickering when the ball is put in play i am often distracted by a graphical anomaly in the background such as the top of the fence having a strobe light effect as the texture pops in and out thankfully the batting and pitching is not affected by significant framerate drops meaning it plays well but the pitcher animation almost looks digitized the most noticeable framerate drops occur when in the broadcast moments such as zooming in on the pitcher after an outas of this writing i don have any patches to download and i don know if there are any but will note that i cannot currently connect to the game servers i can only play offline modes like exhibition road to the show and franchisei will play more of the switch verison in the days ahead but am switching back to playstation to dive deeper into diamond dynasty franchise mode and road to the show one thing i starting to notice by alternating between this and last year game is the ball appears to have more weight now it hard to say just how much that affects play but getting weak wood on a ball feels a little differentday always been a fan of diamond dynasty shorter threeinning games and the new mini seasons mode is the best implementation yet offering great competition against cpucontrolled teams and nice rewards i games into my first season and am currently just a game over yet would make the fourteam playoff if the season ended here if i win the championship i receive an evan longoria card as well as a diamond championship bundleon the field in these games i seeing some slick fielding animations that factor in player momentum cpu opponents on allstar difficulty can still turn flawless plays more often than they probably should but i am seeing a fair number of bobbles almost always for a player with a lower fielding rating overall the play is nicely balanced and i feel like i seeing the proper outcomes for swing timing and at what angle i make contact with the ball again there seems to be more weight to it which makes for grounders that are easier to read and more accurate trajectories off of the wall the fielding was great last year and this year edition is right there perhaps a little better through the new animations that sony has sewn into the mixcard collecting has also been rewarding delivering a steady stream of cards for missions that are completed each diamond dynasty mode offers a slew of tasks some can be completed within minutes if you are on your gamei still haven spent any time in road to the show but did mess around with franchise mode outside of enhanced trade logic and options i not seeing much here that is different and i doubt i would be able to tell much given how it hasn been a huge draw for me over the last few installmentsfor day six i hoping the servers hold up better so i can spend more time in multiplayer i also dive into conquet to

recommendingfor our absolute favorite games however you can check out the list below it a list we will be updating as often as games worthy of inclusion release we will kick games off and add new ones as the switch library growsplease note that while the list below contains entries we arent actually ranking them if a game has made it this far and managed to stay here its a mustplay period as such well be listing entries in reverse chronological order also youll find a rundown of previous entries at the bottom of the list while those titles have gotten bumped for bigger and better experiences they are still all great games in their own right and worth exploring if youre already caught up on the latest hitshere are game informers picks for the top games on the switchpokmon legends arceus stands as the biggest change of pace for the longrunning franchise set in an ancient version of sinnoh you tasked with exploring a large world to fill out the firstpokdex though not a true open world the sense of freedom still feels liberating as does the less restrictive battle system where players can freely sneak up challenge and even evade pokmon we loved capturing neverbeforeseen versions of our favorite pocket monsters and a bevy of side quests plus an engaging main narrative kept us glued to our switch screenspokmon legends arceus has its faults but it represents a strong first step towards what we hope is the start of a new series our reviewmetroid fans have been begging nintendo for a brand new metroid adventure for nearly two decades thankfully when nintendo finally delivered it didn disappoint as the name implies dread is a tenseexperience full of challenging boss fights and deadly robots who doggedly chase samus across the various biomes of planet zdr metroid classic explorationbased platforming remains intact and we eagerly hunted down new upgrades like thephantom cloak and the spider magnet the race to percent was over all too quickly but we can wait to see what dread big story reveals mean for the series future our reviewrereleases rarely capture our full attention these days but the wii u mario title was so joyful and fun that we couldn resist jumping back in for the switch port as if that wasn enough nintendo also included a brand new singleplayer campaign titled bowser fury in this standalone experience mario travels across lake lapcat completing various platforming challenges to collectcat shines the larger openworld design of bowser fury feels incredibly refreshing for a mario experience and we loved how each act ends in a kaijusized boss battle our reviewthe tranquil lowstress animal crossing new horizons hit at the exact right time in the world with the news cycle becoming more tumultuous since animal crossing new horizons offersrefuge in the form of a virtual tropical island building and customizing your house and island the way you see fit is immensely rewarding as new horizons delivers a fun daily loop full of goals and rewards our reviewthe fire emblem series has built a cult following through handheld platforms in recent years but with three houses the turnbased strategy series explodes back onto tvs in the best way possible featuring outstanding strategic gameplay a fun story to interact with and influence and multiple paths to take through the narrative fire emblem three houses is one of the best strategy games available today our reviewa crossover event two decades in the making super smash bros ultimate represents the series in its most realized form containing superb fighting mechanics a terrific suite of modes to play and a roster of fighters that features every character in series history and then some super smash bros ultimate is all but an essential title for the switch our reviewevery nintendo console has to have at least one fantastic mario platformer and the switch is no exception mario odyssey released a few months after the launch of the console and it hits all the mario checkboxes necessary to be considered a classic plus a few surprising new ones it whimsical has perfect controls tons to discover and features a city level where all the humans have normal proportions while mario runs around as his short cartoony self it a strange adventure and a musthave for switch owners our reviewthe future of harvest moon is unclear and its recent past is underwhelming thankfully stardew valley exists and improves on nearly every mechanic that series popularized managing a farm may sound like a chore but in stardew valley it a joy watching your crops grow over time and selling them for profit while getting to know the townspeople creates an experience that is difficult to put down adding the portability of the switch only makes the experience better our review of the pc versionfar more than a simple port of the excellent mario kart for wii u deluxe includes all the game dlc extra tracks racers and cars and battle mode which was curiously absent from the original release playing splitscreen mario kart is always a hit and having a version of the game with two controllers you can take anywhere makes it the perfect showcase for the switch our reviewwe not exaggerating when we say the legend of zelda breath of the wild is one of the best games ever made we gave it the rare in our review and gave it our game of the year award as it sets a new high standard for openworld video games being able to go anywhere you can see on the map has never been more true than it is in breath of the wild and it is also filled with the kind of excellent puzzledesign you expect from a zelda experience it a journey you won soon forget and the optional dlc packs add additional challenges and new items worth pursuing to the overworld our

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/03/14/why-austin-wintory-re-recorded-journeys-soundtrack-10-years-later,Why Austin Wintory Re-recorded Journey's Soundtrack 10 Years Later,on march years ago to the date thatgamecompany released journey quickly called one of the greatest games of all time its quiet meditative approach to gameplay and emphasis on multiplayer that promotes connection rather than competition was for the time especially novel the game accrued a massive fan base countless awards and recognition from not only the game industry but the art world at largemore personally it completely changed composer austin wintory life nowadays he one of the more recognizable names in video game soundtracks though it wasn his first job or even his first time working with thatgamecompany he composed the soundtrack to the studio first commercial game flow it was the project that put him on the map since then he composed for the assassin creed series the order dozens of films and many many moreand according to wintory himself he owes it all to journeyin celebration of the game anniversary today wintory released a rerecorded reimagined version of journey soundtrack recorded with the london symphony orchestra the london voice choir and cellist tina guo who played on the original soundtrackto learn about revisiting one of his most recognizable works a decade later we spent time speaking with wintory getting an indepth view into the creative process behind this projectthis interview has been edited and condensed for claritygame informer how did you start brainstorming like i want to rerecord journey original soundtrackaustin wintory i don mean to say it this way but it like i can escape it but i don want that to sound like that a problem i feel so lucky that i have had one thing in my career that is just seemingly nonstop of interest to people you know a lot of composers could go their whole career even very successfully and never have something that quite strikes a nerve with people in that way and i give all credit to the game for that the music i think is one of those where i just tried to stick to what the game offered and then was lucky enough that people liked the music on its own but i think the game is the reason why i get that attentionso all of that said because journey is always around in some way or another and involved in conversations i found myself thinking maybe seven months ago the tenth anniversary of the game is coming and i ought to do something about that if nothing else i want to signal to the world my gratitude for the fact that the world seems to care about this album and this score and this game so what can i do that would offer something interesting or fun i found myself trying to think of what i might do and then a few things sort of convergedthe london symphony orchestra actually reached out to me a number of years ago and said if you ever have something here how to reach us we interested in finding a chance to work together i record in london all the time but i usually don record traditional orchestra you look at a game like assassin creed syndicate we did all that at abbey road but it was with a small chamber group very purposefully chosen of like three violins three violas you know a tiny group that very kind of visceral and close or abz we recorded there we recorded choir i did a room of all harps these are not traditional orchestra though so i was like i don really do traditional orchestra very often i did that growing up and i loved it and it feels so oldfashioned even though i love that kind of music i don tend to find myself writing that so much or if i do it modified somehowand so i really wanted to work with them and they seemed open to working with me but i couldn think of the right thing with that in the back of my head about six months ago it dawned on me journey anniversary was coming up what if i kind of merged these two threads and were to do a london symphony reimagining of the score and then right as i was trying to search for the words for what i was trying to achieve somebody tagged me on twitter and gave me the most perfect succinct description of what i was doing they knew better than i did what i was trying to achieve so i have to credit this twitter user i don even remember their twitter handle they tagged me in a tweet they were responding to somebody else but they effectively said journey is their number one pick for if they could go back in time and experience something for the first time again the idea that if i could erase my memory and men in black deneuralize or neuralize i guess and have the feeling of this thing that meant so much to me and yet it new againso this project gave me the chance to of course not do that but to do something that as close as i think we can get to that that my goal i don know if i achieved that but the aspiration is for people who really care about this music and if there even one person in the world consider me grateful hopefully this gives them a chance to have that feeling of this is familiarand yet i haven heard this i don know this version of it that became the guiding light how do i offer up a thing that doesn just rehash it it takes the opportunity to offer up something newgi when we jumped on the call we were talking about how there are a lot more electronic elements in the original soundtrack how did you transpose that into something that now utilizes a full orchestraa i mean i don know if i have a good sort of i just did x and y and that took care of it it was a lot of exploring and experimenting and being very frustrated laughs because the original kind of borders on new age music until the very end it very meditative the electronics are very smooth other than a few little key sections like the sand surfing section that we call road of trials and whatnot it pretty inwardlooking and deliberately lowkey rightso i thought okay if that a new age album how do i do something that almost more like a joe hisaishi castle in the sky spirited away album where it uses the orchestra in a very expressive and colorful way and what was before a single note being held by a synthesizer might now be a note that swims around in flutes and french horns and violas it the same note but i passing it around so that it feels like the original is almost grayscale and now it bursting with color hopefully we see if it feels like that to anybody else but that was the goalas you might imagine it became really easy to overdo it and suddenly it stopped feeling like journey i would get all excited and i would work on something and i be like oh i can do this and it would become this thing where the orchestra especially the size orchestra we had which was gigantic it really easy to kind of unleash the fireworks it very tempting because it so fun it so satisfying you know when you listen to just absolutely offthehook rambunctious orchestral forces marshaling together there no thrill quite like that for me but that not really what journey is so then it became okay how quiet can i keep this because this is over a hundred musicians and if i can make them all play together generally on the quiet side that its own thrillgi any creative at all like even your magnum opus will have one or two things in it that you like ah i would do that differently was there anything from journey that sat with you for years and this was the opportunity to be like i changing that thing right therea the funny thing is i had to resist the temptation because once you start doing that kind of thing constantly all these little changes that might be imperceptible start to really aggregate and it really starts to feel very different that could be a problem so i had to kind of reel myself in and say you know i was when i started writing journey i now i a pretty different composer than i was then hopefully a better one i see things though more clearly than i did then there a certain innocence of my confusion that i think is part of what makes journey what it is so i didn wanna sacrifice that i didn wanna make it something that it wasn which meant i had to kind of pick those moments where i sneak in slightly more dare i say sophisticated thingsbut then there also things that are more obvious for example the really big one on the final song i was born for this in the original i worked with this absolutely spectacularly amazing singer named lisbeth scott she is a legend one of my favorite bragging points about her is that john williams wrote a solo for her personally for the spielberg movie munich that is one of the most haunting things i ever heard in a movie around that same time she also was the singing princess in shrek when the bird and the princess are singing higher and higher and higher and the bird explodes the voice of the princess in that moment is lisbeth she in a million soundtrack recordings and she writes her own scores i had worked with her i worshiped her and i hired her to sing i was born for this well i was born for this is written in five languages it in latin french and technically not modern french because it joan of arc so it more like middle french but it effectively french middle english which is not the same thing as modern english at all it a fully different language japanese and greek ancient greeki always thought how cool would it be to have each language represented by somebody for whom that language is native that was always one of the things in the back of my head if i ever redo this piece it would be fun to do that now three of the five languages are not modern languages so it really just the japanese and the french that i can do the pure version of this but i was able to get a russian singer for the latin section and i was able to get a fabulous french singer a greek singer a japanese singer and then i have a friend who from mexico who i worked with a million times and i just always look for more excuses to collaborate with i told her you get to do the beowulf middle english because there nobody that speaks that anyway she just a superb singer anyway when the final verse comes in and we get this kind of big powerful statement of the main theme set to the words of joan of arc her final words before she died do not grieve for me for i was born for this i just reached out to a bunch of people that i either worked with for years and love working with or i always wanted to work with so all told there singers that all pile on top of each other for the finale of i was born for thisit as much a reflection of the road i taken i met all these people over the last years precisely because of what journey enabled about my career i crossed paths with all these amazing talents just because of where my career has taken me in those years it seemed like a fun way to bring it all back home and say i would never have met you if i hadn worked on this so now let work on this together that a big changegi are sony and thatgamecompany involved with thisa jenova chen cofounder of thatgamecompany and i talk fairly regularly i told him i was going to do this and he seemed to be excited about it as you can imagine i don know how closely you follow their current game sky but it massive so he just busy with sky so it was kinda like oh that sounds really cool let me know how it goes i invited him to london i said if you wanna come and hang out while we rerecord the orchestra it would be genuinely an honor to have you there he was like days away from his wife giving birth to their second kid so he said i suspect i will not be able to come to london and so he knows about it and was excited about itand sony similarly they were not involved in any creative or pragmatic ways but of course i let them know that i was doing it they always been very supportive of all my shenanigans i conducted the music live and i made alternate versions of some of the tracks that work better for live performances and they always been supportive of thatgi so does that mean were you selffunding this whole thinga i did laughs yeah i and a friend ready at dawn cofounder andrea pessino originally i was dreaming of a more scaleddown version as i let my imagination run wild with it i found myself thinking this is starting to get to a place financially that is a bit far of a reachandrea basically said how can i be involved so we came out to london i solicited his feedback throughout the whole process he the cofounder of ready at dawn and also their chief technology officer the engine that the order runs in he basically built himself so he this engineer and programming savant i mean he just this genius but he also this deeply intuitive and talented musician he was a conservatory student growing up in italy as a kid essentially a child prodigy pianist he could have easily had a career in music but chose something very different so he always wanted to be more involved in music and basically the idea was well what if we produce this album together so that meant we shared the costs but also he was a creative confidant for me and a sounding board and attended the recording sessions and helped every step of the way i eternally grateful for it it would been something different if he hadn been part of itgi how many musicians played on the original soundtracka maybe players max basically it caps out around or just shy of probably musicians on the original scoregi so the jump up to the new soundtrack is adding people basicallya about i think it all told over total musicians because we had a orchestra and a choir and then something like singersin the song i was born for this there is a big moment where the orchestra builds and then you hear just two violins alone going right before the big climax and the japanese section begins that actually a separate musician a violinist who lives in the detroit area named taylor davis who a big youtuber who i worked with many times over the years she was like the featured star soloist of the banner saga trilogy that i worked on and just one of my favorite people we done live shows together and i just adore herthe reason we met is she did one of the most amazing journey covers that anyone has ever done there this great video on youtube where she playing in the sand dunes and then in the snow in a full journey costume playing her violin she does this absolutely amazing thing when that came out it was the first time i had seen somebody go to that length with a full music video and everything of my work and so i reached out to her and said i can believe you did this and we been friends ever since she did an amazing music video when assassin creed syndicate came out with another musician so i said i have to find somewhere for taylor to be involved in this so there a little bit in i was born for this as wellso yeah all told i haven actually done the count but whatever that is it somewhere in that neighborhoodgi it a huge jump regardlessa it a completely different animal yeah or sogi on the tracks is that all of them playing together like live tracking people or did you do it in chunksa almost the orchestra is always playing together but the choir was done on a separate day and there a lot of reasons for that but honestly the main one was covid laughs it was daunting enough to record musicians right as the omicron variant was starting to appear in london we had to do daily testing everyone in the orchestra obviously not only had to test but if anybody had somebody show up at home that tested positive even if their test was negative they would switch out the musician for a backup on the day that kind of thingthe recording studio that we were in which is the recording studio that the london symphony owns it a converted church in the middle of central london that they bought and retrofitted as their primary recording studio and rehearsal space for when they give concerts when they go on tour we recorded there it sort of their home territorythe room you could fit the choir in there if you really wanted to jam it in but we would been really tempting fate in a way that would essentially been unethical to jam that many together also when you recording the more instruments you get into the room the more you lose control of your ability to mix it afterward because now it just like whatever happens in the room is whatever you get you can imagine like if the mix is placing the listener ear somewhere you can kind of move the ears around a little bit when you got a huge number together but you can do things like oh the french horn is too loud let bring them down because they going to be filtering into every microphone in the room a little bit so the only way to bring them down is to bring the whole thing down and so this is partly why a lot of times on video games and on films you often record things in smaller portions so that you have maximum control and you don have to just have a master volume ride up and down but for this kind of thing i thought it would be just so heavenly to do it the oldfashioned waygi you recording this for the anniversary of journey what do you think will be the stories and anecdotes from this process that are going to stand out to you years from todaya oh man that a great question i also just realized that of all the people to leave off that initial list this is the most horrifying and embarrassing but tina guo of course comes back and plays the cello solos again we recorded her at capitol records here in los angeles so she was also separate from the orchestra it blasphemy to not mention her because she the heart and soul of it although i did change the cello relationship to the musicin any case the reason that triggered is because that was the first thing i thought of is going into the studio with her you know she and i have known each other now for about years we started working on journey together years ago it came out years ago it was a big launching pad for both of us you know she now one of the busiest musicians probably on the planet not just because of journey in fact journey probably least so at this point i mean my god she a featured soloist on dune and a million other things that signal boost her quite effectively but there something very nostalgic about it and she and iwhen i recording obviously i do this as a profession so i tend to go into a little bit of a battle mode now i very cavalier and i joke around i tell jokes all the time the first day with the london symphony i tell all my jokes and they being very typically stoic british people and having a very stiff upper lip with me about my jokes but by the second day they warmed up to me and we were enjoying each other we were being more jokey as i tend to be and very irreverent just having fun because i say look we making music how crazy is this our job today is to walk away with something that hopefully just sounds beautiful some people have dangerous jobs or very grueling jobs or very boring jobs and this today is our job so fg hell let enjoy it let make sure it fun and it doesn feel overly serious but that said if you not serious enough you gonna fall behind schedule and then you going to have an incomplete project because it not like you can just record as much as you want and run the clock midnight this stuff gets pretty pricey laughsso i tend to be very very particular and i plan things very anally and all that nonetheless i knew we would probably have a little extra time which means we could probably take our time and i wanted to end with apotheosis i just thought that piece that seven minutes and change completely and totally changed my life it just feels so fitting to bring this almost spiritual experience of a recording session to a close with that one and as focused and warrior mode as i can get while i working despite the joking when we first recorded it we do what called a sightread which is like a rehearsal sightread means they have not practiced this they are reading the music by sight for the first time the first playthrough there wasn a rehearsal the day before or something like that you go into the studio they look at the music they give it a quick glance and they go okay ready and they can play it almost perfectly the first time it is sorcery it shouldn be possible especially because as minimalistic as a lot of journey can be it actually not the easiest music to play particularly apotheosis they not playing random notes it a very specific thing they have to play if they play a wrong note everyone can hear itand so it not hard but it not easy of course the goal is not just to get it right the goal is to make it sing the goal is to make it feel expressive and beautiful as if they been working on it and practicing it their whole life so it my job as a conductor to really set them up for that part of what we do is say let just read it down top to bottom it like a table read for actors on a tv show let just read around the table you don have to worry about being in character yet you don have to worry about like what your body language gonna be we just wanna know what the words taste like and then we start to piece it together we do a thing very similar in a recording session so i said let just run through it and read it because apotheosis ends with this long high cello solo of tina where she playing as the character walking into the light spoiler alertgi i played it don worrya yeah i suspected you did so i ask the principal cellist of the london symphony for now that part will be recorded in los angeles when i come back home but so that the rest of the orchestra will know what we be missing will you play it just for now for our first time through so he has to sightread this really high and delicate part you know cello is a low instrument and this is a really highend part tina that one of her specialties she can play up where the violins play because she just a monster but cellists that not a normal skill in cello but of course these are the worldclass cellists so they can all handle it tooso we just read it down all seven and a half minutes of all this music they played it very nearly perfectly from start to finish including tina solos as a placeholder i absolutely felt my eyes well up while i was conducting it not that i broke down in tears but it was overwhelming it not that i react to the piece the way someone else might and get moved by it because i too aware of what it took to make it but the piece become it like this old friend it like if you see a friend from college that you used to spend all day every day with and you stay in touch but you haven seen each other in a long timeso all that came together at once of this old friend visiting for the first time in years and just knowing how much i missed this experience it was overwhelming i never forget it i conducting the london fg symphony orchestra on this piece that changed my life and we making music together and this is incredible and i in one of my favorite cities in the world i just can fathom that any of this is real and this is somehow my life it really got me in that moment all that stacking on top i became very emotional i never forget that,en,516.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/11/off-the-golden-path-progression-and-exploration-in-halo-infinite,Off The Golden Path – Progression And Exploration In Halo Infinite,halo infinites campaign offers two distinct paths for players its one of the biggest things setting the game apart from its predecessors as i checked out a threehour demo of the campaign it was apparent that master chiefs newest adventure affords the option of a familiar actionpacked golden path like nearly all previous halo games infinites mostly linear main story playthrough aims to offer a satisfying and tightly paced adventure a defined and engaging narrative and clear objective markers that carry you to the subsequent big setpiece encounter based on the extensive demo i experienced players looking for that classic halo campaign structure wont be disappointedhowever the alternative path through the game sets halo infinite apart from what has come before after an introductory sequence that establishes the gameplay and stakes of the story infinite opens up and allows for far more freeform exploration and progression than earlier games in the franchise theres a whole loop of character improvement discoverable pickups armor upgrades and optional battles awaiting players who choose to stray from the main path while the developers at industries continue to resist the term open world to describe the experience theres no doubt that what i witnessed borrows liberally from openworld trends in action and shooting games of the last decade the difference of course is that those open areas are filled with the type of tense halo gunplay and action the series has always been known for and that makes all the differenceone of the reasons halo infinite is not a traditional open world is the way its partitioned as you first emerge onto the surface of the zeta halo most openworld games give relative freedom to fully explore wherever you want to go even if some areas might be especially challenging to confront early on instead infinite partitions its explorable content into specific areas each filled with a bevy of encounters a list of discoverable items to track down and a defined zone of play players progress the story to unlock new areas and eventually return to previous locales to complete further exploration and conquestson the highest level master chief is fighting back the forces of the banished a splinter faction that was once part of the covenant across the zeta halo while rallying the unsc forces that have crashlanded there after the devastating destruction crash of the unsc infinity if that sounds like a familiar narrative loop it should industries has been open about how much halo infinite draws inspiration from the original halo combat evolvedfor players choosing to explore the game accordions back and forth between large open areas where you set the terms of the engagement and more narrowly defined sequences that take you into the halos interior spaces the developers openly describe as dungeons together the give and take between those expansive open areas and tighter interiors feels reminiscent of early games in the franchise even if some of the activities youre now pursuing are along the optional path to conquest and control of a zoneto complete that part of his mission master chief is on a continual battle for territory while there are many moving parts to the conflict the most crucial starting point in any new area is the local forward operating base or fob these unsc outposts have been overrun by the banished and players need to clear them out to retake the fob upon regaining control the tactical map updates with relevant nearby points of interest in addition the fob becomes a fast travel point finally control of a fob transforms it into a resupply point where you can fill up on ammo and requisition additional supplies troops and even vehiclesthe ability to call in the weapons or other aid you need is a gamechanger for letting you shape your approach to combat but its not wholly freeform instead players must build up a resource called valor which determines which tier of items you can call down expect to do some groundwork first if you want to bring a scorpion tank into your next sortievalor is acquired from numerous activities around a given area for instance banished propaganda towers can be destroyed to gain valor alternately track down a squad of imprisoned unsc marines and rescue them to obtain valor activities like these fuel the expansion of your valor and in turn give you more options for requisitions at the fobthats not the only way you might acquire something new at a fob resupply point highvalue targets allow for another fun diversion leading to unique weapons you cant acquire anywhere else in the game we saw the battle against one highvalue target named okro vagaduun an elite blademaster who wields a special highpowered energy sword if you track down his location on the tacmap you can defeat him and pick up his sword completely clear out his cadre of troops along with him and you can requisition the highstrength energy sword back at the fob bringing it with you into future battles the game includes many named minibosses like this each of which has a different piece to add to your growing arsenalyou can also spend time in a given area tracking down discoverables all of which serve different purposes audio logs are scattered across the zeta halo each helping flesh out the story including details of what happened to captain lasky and the rest of the unsc infinitys crew you may also want to try to hunt down the everelusive and gameplayaltering skulls but like in previous games theyll be hard to findanother major discoverable item is spartan cores these optional upgrades let you gradually improve your equipment the major equipment for your armor is found along the critical path of play but it might not be at its full potential when discovered spartan cores can be used to improve your shield strength or you can enhance the new grappleshot perhaps adding a voltaic shock that stuns enemies once you acquire the threat sensor equipment piece you can use spartan cores to increase the number of deployable sensors you may put into the field at any given timewhether its increased requisitions from your controlled fobs special weapons acquired through the defeat of highvalue targets or improved equipment from the spartan cores youve uncovered your development of master chiefs options and power all feeds into increased options for the big fights youll have to confront beyond the activities already described halo infinite also features numerous larger bases some of which are missioncritical and others of which you can optionally choose to try and conquerthese major banished structures are unique freeform encounters built to let you take them on in a matter of your choosing and use the tools youve developed and advanced through exploration the team at industries informally described these types of encounters as supersoldier base assaults the idea is to provide the player broad freedom to take on a big multipart battle in one sequence master chief loaded up a warthog with a selection of rescued marines and charged into the thick of a walled base but as an alternative he could have used the grappleshot to get to a good vantage point and opened the fight by sniping numerous targets before entering in yet another option he could use the grappleshot to go over the walls by himself at a less defended rear soft point and progress from there or perhaps he could have enough valor to call in a vtol wasp and fly into the central tower from above at the end of the base we saw master chief ascended to a far upper floor and confronted a named and stealthhidden elite adding punctuation to the end of this largescale fight these types of battles promise to be big and bombastic especially when faced on higher difficulties the potential for chaos and creativity is highafter several hours with halo infinite its clear is trying new things especially related to optional exploration and upgrades but i was also surprised by the pacing and flow of battles and how much they recalled the earliest games in the halo canon the flow of individual exchanges with the banished enemies has that distinct feel of halo encounters i remember facing in the early its the mixing of that exciting combat loop with the more openended explorations that has me most excited about halo infinite even after just those few hours it seems clear that this new juggernaut release will offer the most expansive and choicedriven halo experience to datefor more on halo infinite in the leadup to its launch on

The Reemergence Of Thanos, And What Year Three Holds",marvel strike force launched on ios and android two years ago and while it has evolved in myriad ways since launch every mode features similar gameplay where you take on aicontrolled teamsfor the third year of foxnext licensed rpg the studio is implementing playerversusplayer combat through vs battle mode i spoke with creative director jason bender and game director jonathan durr to learn more about this new feature as well as what to expect in the comingyear of marvel strike forceup to this point in the lifecycle of marvel strike force players have only had the option to take on aicontrolled opponents while this has been a serviceable option so far the ai in marvel strike force always operates in patterned ways simply choosing the most powerful attack available to the character at that time with few exceptions and often not focusing or coordinating on a single targetthisai predictabilityis by designthere a little bit of rng going on in there but the ai is intentionally simplistic because we don want it to be frustratingbender sayswe wanted you to test your skills against the enemy team composition also when you play something repeatedly you can master it so we like a lot of our things to be static several of our modes you can play again and again and again so you can crack that puzzleas the third year of marvel strike force kicks off the team is adding vs battle a new mode that allows you to challenge other players to realtime synced pvp battles each player brings his or her own roster and engages in a draft to determine which five characters are making the walk to the battlefieldhowever the draft is far from a straightforward pickwhoyouwant experiencewe experimented with a lot of different drafting techniques and we will likely develop a bunch of different kinds of drafting in the futurebecause we found a bunch of fun ways to do it bender says we launch with a good steady way to do it and then we get into more interesting ones over timein the first iteration of the drafting mechanics each player gets two character bans once a character is banned by either player they are off the board for both sides after that a serpentine draft takes place until both teams of five are full if a character is chosen by one player that character is off the board for the other thenboth players get a reject to exercise meaning they can choose a character the other player picked to boot off the opposing team finally each player gets one final draft pick to fill the hole left by the rejected characterfoxnext hopes this encourages players to experiment with their rosters and get creative with their team compositions you can always build the same team and you can rely on having access to all of these characters bender says so sure you might want captain marvel but if i ban captain marvel you going to have to find an alternative for the structure you building and that introduces a whole bunch of new hybrid teams you haven had to worry about beforewhat happens if you get twothirds of the way through building asgardians and then i knock out hela what kind of drafting strategies are resilient when it comes to the other person trying to spoil it for you these are really fun things to learn and it always changesonce you in a vs battle combat works much in the way it does against ai opponents however this time you have to account for a human player reacting to your moves and devising strategies to counter not only your team compositions but your strategies as well combat operates on a timer for each move with the ai taking over if a player drops until they able to rejoinwhen it launches players will only be able to challenge their friends for lowstakes fun matches with no direct rewards doled out but foxnext has grand ambitions for vs battle down the road we toying with launching with some achievements just to encourage people to try the feature out durr says we got ideas on our side doing rewards doing leagues and tiers and stuff like that youcould move through the ranks battling people out but you know one of the things i also excited about doing maybe much further down the road would beevents within the alliance where the alliance has a tournament featurewhile those ambitions for vs battle are aimed at further down the line foxnext has several nearterm updates additions and tweaks it has been eyeingwhile the playerversusplayer feature is one userscan look forward to with the next update the most recent onebeginsa rollout nearly two years in the making thanos is finally becoming the supercharged villain he has been in the comics and movies the black order thanos disciples shown inavengers infinity war are joining the playable rosterwhen thanos is teamed up with proxima midnight corvus glaive cull obsidian and ebony maw the mad titan becomes infinity gauntlet thanos this version of thanos has all of the infinity stones in his possession and can blast enemies flip ally debuffs and enemy buffs and even rain a shattered planet onto his adversaries foxnext anticipates this new squad of villains will be the next strongest team in marvel strike forcei really excited that thanos is going to finally get his black order bender says we had the black order built for so long but we haven tuned them or tightened up their strategies it so great to finally see them come together because while thanos has been a rockstar in our game since the beginning he been overshadowed by newer characters he about to step up in a way that players asked for right from the beginningit may seem strange to add characters that were so prominently featured in one of the biggest movies ever nearly two years after that movie hit theaters but foxnext says the design process for the black order is a special case and is not indicative of how long the character design and implementation process normally takes we did the concept art for these characters when infinity war came out bender says they getting a little more balancetime and attention because this team is so cuttingedge powerful we want to make sure we minimize power creep this is a big concern for the balance team we don like it when there too much power creep because it invalidates things we invested in if i invested in a team we don want to see that investment become worthless ideally ever definitely as slowly as possible so it was very very difficult to make this team worth getting and dominant without blowing up power creepwhile bender and his team at foxnext have made efforts to reduce power creep it has happened and it has affected different characters in different waystwo characters that proved to be among the most coveted in the early days of the game were black widow and night nurse black widow delivered massive bumps in speed to her allies while night nurse was viewed as all but essential to raid effectively while black widow has remained relevant she is far from the best character in the game as she was considered two years ago while night nurse has dropped off from relevancy substantiallyblack widow has an ability that scales and that is always in fashion you always want speed bender says night nurse abilities are more numerical and have a certain amount of power built in so she has not scaled over time to keep up we don want the top of the game to be static you don want black widow to be the best character forever for a long time in year one we were worried that black widow would just never go away so to some extent power creep is good because it keeps the top of the game more interestingbender acknowledgement that power creep can shuffle the deck a little spells out a silver lining of adding new characters that knock the existing ones down a notch but he doesn want those characters to possess lower value foreverblack widow is going to get more love because she got a movie coming out she a badass and we want to make sure that she becomes relevant again he says now that we have more of a rockpaperscissors kind of action and we have more specialized abilities in the game it not as difficult for us to bring her back up to strategic relevance because we not risking stagnating the endgame night nurse we going to need to find another opportunity to bring her back up we always want characters who are at the bottom of the stack of power to be shuffled back up to the top over time night nurse will have her day again that was the joke about ronan right will have his day ronan was at the bottom of the stack for a long time ronan was up top now he kind of floating down again we see that with night nurse tooas bender mentioned black widow is the eponymous star of the next theatrical release of the marvel cinematic universe so the team wants to capitalize on that however with the pandemic pushing most theatrical releases back foxnext finds itself in thesituation of having to adjust its plans on the fly while its team is working remote like most studios across the globe it has also shuffled its plans in favor of experimenting with characters that might have come out in the more distant futurea lot of the marvel movies as we know from what going on in the world right now have moved back a little bit bender says a lot of times we try to come out with a movie so that when you walk out of the theater or you thinking about these characters you get to play them we like to be there for that this year is a little funky that way which is giving us the opportunity to consider some characters that we haven gotten around to i don think i have any characters i can actually announce as a scoop for you but i will say it giving us a chance to pick up oneoffs here and there and add them to the schedule characters that we couldn build as part of a fiveperson squad we can now do some solos and that going to be neat we see some characters that we weren planning on at the beginning of the year show upwhile the entire globe faces uncertainty foxnext recently emerged from its own period of being unsure about the future as disney recently sold the studio to scopely effectively transitioning the team from an inhouse disney studio to a thirdparty partnerwe really good at uncertainty now bender says if you been with us from the beginning you seen us go from kabam to fox to disney to scopely we are always in a state of transition practically we try not to let that affect the game and i think we pretty good at that what we really care about is what the players want and we been lucky that our partners have always understood that so while it can be a bit thrilling internally it doesn affect how we run the gamewhile we don know when exactly vs battle will be added to marvel strike force foxnext says it will be a part of the next big update for the title marvel strike force is currently available for ios and androidto learn whyi spent a significant chunk of my time playing the title

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/08/13/five-ways-to-spend-your-time-in-assassins-creed-odyssey,Five Ways To Spend Your Time In Assassin’s Creed Odyssey,the assassins creed series is famous for its rich worlds with various activities to pursue assassins creed odyssey is continuing that tradition but the team at ubisoft quebec is also expanding on it by layering in a variety of new interconnected systems the story of alexios or kassandra searching for their family is still the central pillar of odyssey but the content supporting that arc has grown more intricate and interestingtheres still a main narrative that youre going to want to follow but there are a lot of other things for you to do says game director scott phillips youre going to follow the main path for a couple of hours and then at some point youre going to go i need to level up or i need to get a new weapon or i need to go do something else and we give you a huge buffet of things to dothis is one of the major ways odyssey is evolving beyond the previous installment since origins relied primarily on basic sidequests to get players to the recommended level for the next story mission in odyssey you spend your time with a broader and more varied array of tasks these are the diversions that grab your attention and entice you to stray from the critical path with promises of treasure allies and moreodyssey is set during the time of the peloponnesian war which means that athens and sparta are constantly fighting for control over many nationstates your intervention can change the tides of an individual conflict but it wont win the war that isnt the kind of progress youre making here instead youre working for the rewards you get along the way as youre flipping or defending a nationstate the world is a moving chessboard with says creative director jonathan dumont some are owned by athens some are owned by sparta we wanted you to be able to pick a side at any point since youre a mercenary in the gameyou dont have any particular loyalty to athens or sparta so which side you choose is purely practical you can look at the potential rewards for siding with one power or another and then work toward the outcome you prefer thats a multistep process not just a single mission each nation their resources their power their ability to wage war is shown to the player represented as a nation power gauge phillips says the player will have ingame actions that they can perform that will weaken the state killing soldiers destroying their war supplies stealing their national treasure and then ultimately killing their leader which will make them the most vulnerableonce you are victorious and your reward is in the bank the nationstate will eventually fall into jeopardy again and you can continue the cycle except maybe that next time the other side has a more tempting offeryour ship is more than a means of transportation its your base of operations and a formidable weapon the vessels baseline power levels up with you automatically so you wont be outgunned in regular encounters if you dont want to fuss over upkeep on the other hand for players that enjoy the naval element you can invest additional time and resources to upgrade your ships hull and weapons to become a greater threatanother way to improve your ship is through passive boosts you get from characters you recruit these can be drawn from multiple categories including friends you help mercenaries you defeat or even regular soldiers on patrol they have bonuses for you ship dumont says these are called our lieutenants and you can have four that are active at the same time on your ship but you can have a roster and collect them like pokmonthe naval elements dont appeal to every player so diving deep on these features isnt a requirement but it offers a satisfying way to tie various activities together for those who are interested it makes it feel like theres a connection between the land and the sea which was always we knew could be a challenge phillips saysthough technically part of the war effort contracts are quests that run in the background they usually involve targeting particular groups or units like killing a set number of athenian soldiers or berserker spartans these are longterm quests phillips says these are things youre going to pick up from the message board some you might complete within minutes and some you might not complete for five hourscontracts are put out through war leaders so your success ultimately contributes to strengthening or weakening your chosen side in a conflict but message boards also allow you to pick up a more neutral quest bounties just like when other mercenaries come hunting for you when you step out of line you can bring justice to people who break the law bounties might even set you against other mercenaries posted by people who want to get revenge while these may be more straightforward quests they can have some narrative significance theyre real stories that we retouched so it fits our game but a lot of these things are part of the research weve donedumont saysthe cycle of collecting loot to help you defeat stronger foes and get even better loot is a staple of the rpg genre this was one of the things propelling you forward in assassins creed origins but the concept has been expanded even more in odysseyone sign that your gear is even more important is that your armor now occupies specific body slots head chest waist arms and legs what youre wearing isnt just cosmetic like in origins five armor slots mean you have five opportunities to improve your stats and create stacking bonuses but you also arent stuck with your equipments innate properties since you can engrave items with a special bonus like improved defense or boosts to certain kinds of damageengraving is good for enhancing what you want to focus on or making up for areas where youre weak phillips says if your armor is really low because youre an assassin player and youre wearing more cloth gear youre not going to be wearing the super helmeted stuff youre going to be weaker in fight so maybe you want to engrave things that are going to make you a little more balanced in that wayas you progress you can expect a steady stream of new gear to replace your old stuff while that is usually a good idea the team at ubisoft quebec isnt forcing you to leave your favorite pieces behind like origins you have the option to bring a lowerlevel piece of equipment up to your current level this process costs obsidian so you wont be upgrading every piece of equipment this way but if you have a weapon that you love with just the right enhancements for your playstyle you can keep it relevant until something better comes alongthe mercenary system allows you to fight challenging enemies and reap rare rewards plus it lets you recruit powerful lieutenants to accompany you on your journey imagine the phylakes from origins crossed with a hint of shadow of mordors nemesis system if that combination sounds fun to you read more about it with our indepth feature about how mercenaries worknot every part of your progression isnew or reimagined fans of previous games can expect plenty of the activities that have helped define the series through the years all of the stuff youre accustomed to doing in assassins creed still feeds into your progress you assassinate you complete points of interests phillips says so forts camps tombs ruins sunken shipwrecks and things like that will give you xp some of these might contain threads that lead you toward other optional quests or send you to areas of the map that you may not have explored otherwisethat isnt a comprehensive list of everything you can do in assassins creed odyssey these are just the primary loops that tie into your progression while it may seem straightforward the intricacy of these systems becomes apparent when you see how they all interact to get a sense for how the elements can affect each other take a look at this arrowfilled diagram from ubisoftplayers may not always think of their exploits in terms of a flow chart but the image showcases the borderlineridiculous degree to which a single act can have consequences in other areas of the worlds gameplay ecosystem dont be overwhelmed though the goal isnt to drown players in mandatory busywork instead the team wants to provide different activities and worthwhile rewards to ensure that players can engage with the things that interest themwe dont want you to just blow through the main story

Ooze,cowabunga dudes the teenage mutant ninja turtles are back in shredders revenge a new coop brawler that transports fans to the franchise golden era in video games developed by in partnership by two turtlesloving studios dotemu streets of rage windjammers and tribute games panzer paladin mercenary kings shredders revenge is an original adventure where up to four players defend the sewers and streets in a brawler inspired by tmnts arcade heyday namely turtles in timelike any tmnt game worth its salt shredders revenge lets up to four friends team up both locally and online crossplay to be determined to beat the tar out of villains like the foot clan bebop rocksteady and shredder himself the game draws inspiration from the iconic animated show and if youre somehow worried that the developers dont understand the source material jettison those doubts now both dotemu and tribute games are staffed by oldschool tmnt fans who like many of us were raised on the classic cartoon collected its multitude of toys and spent way too much money playing the arcade games from the games character and art design to the remade version of that famous theme song performed by faith no mores mike patton shredders revenge is designed to be the ultimate love letter to tmnts glory yearswe wanted to bring back a game for the fans of the animated series and also the old arcade games of the says tribute games cofounder jeanfrancois major because we felt that people missed it and including us because personally i played those games a lot as a kid and i missed them a lot so that was the idea that started itdespite clearly going for nostalgia shredders revenge will sport modern enhancements the teams arent ready to talk specifics they are only offering hints by saying the classic games fun as they were hit a ceiling in terms of technical limitations which are now a thing of the past theres no doubt shredders revenge will play smoother than the old games and features such as new modes and other options are implied but not confirmed another element the teams are being coy about is the inclusion of playable characters besides the turtles after all the trailer featured master splinter and april oneil kicking butt and the developers wouldnt comment on the noticeably absent casey jonesshredder revenge was born from a happy coincidence between two tmntloving development teams who joined forces after discovering they each had a shared vision of making a new turtles game the project began when nickelodeon who holds the turtles license approached dotemu to make a new game based on one of their ips the company was impressed by the studios past work on games like wonder boy the dragons trap and dotemu jumped at the chance to tackle tmnt next as dotemu began mapping out ideas for the game it caught word that tribute games was not only interested in doing the same but had been campaigning to nickelodeon for permission to create a tmnt game since unfortunately the timing was never right but tribute kept in touch with nickelodeon hoping that the stars would one day alignwe were always super persistent says tribute games cofounder jonathan lavigne like if we gonna take on one of your ips we want it to be tmnt every time the topic was brought up about us taking on a project i would always say well we really want to do tmnt we grew up in the arcades and playing tmnt so we really wanted to have a stab at itso i was at gdc and i managed to get tribute games contact says dotemu ceo cyrille imbert so i said hey guys are you around should we talk and so we saw each other for the first time in san francisco and it was a really nice first contact and we basically had the same ideas and things we wanted to do in mind for this projectthus a partnership was born and the two studios began developing the games pitch to present to nickelodeon imbert says his team knew from the start that tribute games was perfect for capturing the classic vibe it hoped to invoke with shredder revenge it also helps that tribute has some exubisoft developers who worked on the game tmnt based on the animated film of the same name for consoles and game boy advance not to mention its experience on scott pilgrim vs the world the gamemajor says that tribute is ecstatic to apply its brawler expertise to a new turtles game and to implement ideas the designers didnt have time to flesh out in the movie tiein gameshredders revenge looks like the tmnt brawler fans have been waiting for which is why its agonizing that it currently has no concrete release window dotemu and tribute games understand the pressure to deliver an experience that satisfies tmnt fans of all ages is high especially since its been a long time since the turtles hada truly great video game but with two teams who each have a knack for creating modernized retro style games it sounds like our favorite pizzaeating martial artists are in pretty good handsteenage mutant ninja

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/08/10/mercenaries-are-the-mvps-in-assassins-creed-odyssey,Mercenaries Are The MVPs In Assassin’s Creed Odyssey,you dont have a creed in assassins creed odyssey it makes sense considering the games setting of greece circa bc predates the establishment of an organized assassin brotherhood by several hundred years in short youre not an assassin or at least not one like weve known throughout the assassins creed series whether you choose alexios or kassandra your official job title is the same mercenary as it turns out youre far from alone in that fieldin assassins creed origins the player character bayek was hunted by powerful enemies throughout his journey bayek was a threat to the pharaoh ptolemy and the ruler sent his private guards the phylakes to track bayek down and snuff out his life it was a fun way to add an additional threat layer to the game and when that signature horn blew players knew they were in for a tough fight once all were killed bayek was rewarded with a slick new outfit and that was it basically in odyssey ubisoft quebec is taking that kernel of an idea and exploding itwithout a strict code to follow youre much freer in the world you can choose to steal slaughter livestock and go on murderous rampages lets say youre going around the world and youre a shead says creative director jonathan dumont its your choice but there are consequences if you commit crimes a bounty will be placed on your head and when mercenaries appear to collect thats when the real fun beginsevery players game starts with mercenaries drawn from a pool of handcrafted characters and others that are randomly generated they all have their own special abilities strengths and weaknesses as well as gear its endless phylakes dumont says and some have bears theyll leave you alone if you walk the straight and narrow but beware if you decide to indulge your criminal fantasiesplayers can accrue an increasing amount of notoriety which is represented by a onetofive scale an easy way to think about it is like the wanted levels in the grand theft auto games when youre wanted the mercenaries will start to look for you a higher bounty attracts higherleveled mercenaries and more of them so it might make sense to pay your fine to get them off your back or if youre feeling more confrontational you can track down the person who issued the bounty and eliminate them and the bounty tootheyre like origins phylakes with a little bit of shadow of wars nemesis system thrown in for good measure the interesting part comes in after youre done battling them once youve incapacitated them you have a couple of options you can choose to kill them or you can hire them if a mercenary is pursuing me throughout the world you know what i want to show respect for that guy and keep him dumont says you can do that regardless of whether you choose to kill them or let them live you get whatever gear they have which can include special legendary itemsmercs and other characters you recruit join your ships crew some of these guys add special abilities for your ship such as reducing cooldowns for your weapons or increasing your ships speed theres also a skill call to arms which allows your character to summon one of your allies into onfoot combat for a whiledont think you can simply massacre your way through all and call it a day the mediterranean is a lucrative place to be and more mercs will arrive to take the place of the fallen as you eliminate the competition by recruiting or killing them youll work your way up the rankings each ranking tier has special benefits such as getting discounts at vendors and smithsbounties will also slowly reduce over time if you stop committing crimes but youll be hunted as long as you have one and as long as you do it pays to be vigilant lets say you have a three star bounty and you go into the world and you go into a big fort and you start messing around says game director scott phillips then they sound the alarm whos coming the bounty hunters all those guys know where youre at theyre seeking you they dont come straight for you they come in the area youre at but in this case when the alarm rings you see them like theyre ring wraiths coming oh no we wanted to create those tension moments when you have a fivestar bounty which takes a long time to store up its something theyll follow you out to sea too so dont think you can easily hop on your boat and sail away from your problemsthe mercenaries seem like a great addition to the series adding a muchneeded layer of variety if you get tired of questing you can decide to pursue mercenaries and level up that way or you can chase after them simply because you want to enhance your ships crew or get better gear youll see them in the world too even if you havent riled up the locals so you can opt for a confrontation on the fly that doesnt mean you have to cause trouble if you want to engage in mercenary combat thoughroleplaying is a big component of odyssey but dont think youll be missing out on the mercenary elements if you decide to play as a lawabiding citizen mercs hang around arenas and you can rise through the ranks in officially sanctioned battles too no murdering stealing or slaughtering requiredassassins creed odyssey is coming to playstation xbox one and pc on october

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/08/19/why-so-many-former-infinity-ward-devs-returned-for-the-new-modern-warfare,Why So Many Former Infinity Ward Devs Returned For The New Modern Warfare,following a dispute with activision over call of duty modern warfare royalties infinity ward cofounders and figureheads vince zampella and jason west were unceremoniously removed from the studio the two went on to form respawn entertainment and created thetitanfall series several key members of the infinity ward team that worked on games like call of duty call of duty modern warfare and call of duty modern warfare followed zampella and west to respawn leaving a vastly different team to work on modern warfare and subsequent titleshowever over the last couple of years an interesting trend has emerged several of those departing members are back at infinity ward it began with former art lead joel emslie who served as art lead on titanfall and titanfall and continued with former designer geoff smith lead animator mark grigsby and a few othersemslies motivation was driven by his love for counterstrike which made him want to come back to more grounded combat i remember a point in time when i was just getting exhausted by all the wallrunning and jetpacks and the palette and that stuff emslie says the industrys kind of moved that way theres a lot of that going on i guess for me i saw call of duty modern warfare remastered and i started having these thoughts in my head i really missed that i missed that setting i missed that genre i missed that type of gameplay that immersive environment because it looks real to me i missed thatat this same time serendipitously infinity ward studio director dave stohl reconnected with emslie at a work function stohl told emslie that if he ever wanted to come back to infinity ward the team had a spot waiting for him this got emslies wheels turning basically i told him what if i finish out my current project and do my job to the best of my ability and then well talk emslie recalls once i got to that point in time i guess it was like christmas vacation i looked at remastered and i looked at infinite warfare and i was like man the production value of this game theres so much potential and this new engine for modern warfare was five years in development parts of that engine were alive and well in infinite warfare and you could see itthough he hadnt heard any rumors or spoken to any infinity ward employees emslie had a weird feeling that the studio was planning on revisiting modern warfare i said if youre thinking of doing a new modern warfare game im really interested he says i wasnt ndad so he was kind of hesitant but he said yeah were thinking about it and i went im really serious now id love to be a part of that modern warfare was no doubt some of the best development years of my lifeemslie made the call to pack his bags and leave respawn entertainment to return to infinity ward but it wasnt going to be as easy as a simple farewell emslie had worked with the team at respawn for around seven years even longer for the ones who defected from infinity ward alongside him so saying goodbye was a hard processi made sure to go and say goodbye to every single person in the studio the day that i left emslie says i did a quick exit because i didnt want to linger around it was like breaking up with people yeah there were hurt feelings there were people who were really shocked and surprised i feel like i gave it a really good go i never held back i was there for seven years almost and i always went for it as hard as i possibly could i could see the trajectory that they were on and i wanted to try something new that was surprising to some people and there was a period of people not completely understanding my reasoning and then not talkingsoon others followed and the rest of the studio began to notice a trend while the preexisting team was excited to see some of these familiar faces reenter the mix costudio head patrick kelly recalls some mixed emotionsi think people were very excited i think they were a little anxious kelly says they werent sure what that would mean in terms of culture and whatnot of the studio a little nervous because for all of us around the franchise when weve made these games you end up naturally comparing so much of what gets done critically against some of the work these guys didwe had some friction in the beginning emslie adds we had to find our way but i think it worked out because everybody theres a thing in life where you either choose to be a dick or dont be a dick it can happen in traffic or it can happen at work with people you work with dont be a dickwith a palpable mix of excitement and anxiety in the studio emslie wanted to unlock the teams full potential shortly after his return he went around the entire studio and got to his infinity ward team members emslie credits kelly for enabling the team to be optimized and become a higherperforming studio i found people from all walks of life doing different things and doing all in their own way cuttingedge things he says what were looking is the studio is really working at a level ive never seen before because we unlocked this potential that was hereemslie was happy in his new role back at infinity ward but he wasnt about to try and lure others away from respawn it had to be just like it was when we left it really had to be your own decision he says thats important because i would never want to go someplace then tell a bunch of my friends and sell them on an idea then have them show up and it not work out in that respect you have to let people make their own decision i was the first to come over here and i basically think that piqued peoples interestwith their interests piqued by emslies leap grigsby and smith began thinking about making a move of their own as smith began weighing his options he had to think a lot about what this would mean for him and his family its a hard thing to do but when you have that passion for a project you know you could sink your next three years into when the passion hits you you have to go with it i think he explains the reason i ended up coming back my dad was in the marines for years so modern military things hold a pretty dear spot we left with more stories to tell and more things we want to doemslie grigsby and smith left respawn to come back to infinity ward but they hold no animosity toward the titanfall developer with emslie even going out of his way to say that apex legends the first major project from the studio following his departure was brilliantthe only animosity i have is that my product has to be better than yours grigsby says laughing competition thats it friendly competitionwhile these three former respawn developers were interested in returning to infinity ward for their own reasons they all knew it was the right call following a meeting with kelly he has a kindred spirit to what we all are passionate about which is being number one grigsby says it was a passion thing that its all similar to ussimilarly kelly was impressed by the enthusiasm and intensity emslie grigsby and smith brought to the initial conversations they were so bold about what their aspirations were which was another way of them saying this better not be some formulaic thing in any way kelly sayskelly also loves how the returning team members were so unafraid to show that passion and quickly introduced new ideas and approaches to creating a call of duty game i think its very easy especially with something as successful as call of duty has been historically to find yourself in a rut where youre all doing these things because these things have worked he says these guys come back in and theyve got so much energy they had all of these ideas and thoughts and energy and obviously credibilityas infinity ward began work on this years call of duty modern warfare it felt like a convergence of talent the likes of which the studio had never seen in addition to emslie grigsby smith and the other respawn developers naughty dog alumni jacob minkoff and taylor kurosaki joined the team prior to infinite warfare to top it all off the studio brought zied rieke a pivotal member of the team for every call of duty up to modern warfare back as gameplay directorcoincidentally rieke had done stints at respawn entertainment and naughty dog giving him a culminative perspective for all these developers coming to the studio he had worked on uncharted with minkoff and kurosaki and when they left they urged rieke to come back to infinity ward and work with them there he was a tough guy to pry back over here but hes like the codfather so you have to have him on the project kurosaki saysnow with a team that combines old with new the studio is focused on finishing call of duty modern warfare something that on its own energizes the teami think that maybe deep down wherever these people started and where they came from what drove them to come to the studio was the modern warfare series smith says they havent had the opportunity to work on that and i feel like when we started working on this slowly but surely everybody started kind of coalescing into holy crap were making a modern warfare game you could just see the smiles in the hallways and wed have these milestones and these little victories and its starting to get there and its building and building and people would just walk down the hall with a bit bigger smile and people were putting in some extra hours i think all the talent they needed was here maybe we pushed them in one direction or another but i think its the modern warfare title that brought everybody togetherit clear the pieces are in place but how they fit together will ultimately determine the success or failure of this merging of talent well see how well this newly energized team truly comes together when call of duty modern

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/08/27/four-questions-you-should-be-asking-about-assassins-creed-odyssey,Four Questions You Should Be Asking About Assassin's Creed Odyssey,if youre excited for assassins creed odyssey the last month has been a treasure trove of information weve done deep dives on the mercenary system the progression building your crew and more but even with all of the available details a few major points remain foggy the team at ubisoft quebec is still keeping some secrets but if you want to get closer to solving those mysteries here are a handful of questions and some nottoorevealing answers to point you in the right directionat the beginning of odyssey you select whether you want to control alexios or kassandra but are they just two sides of the same coin or two separate coins altogether if you choose one does the other still exist somewhere in the world we didnt get a direct answer to that question during our time at the studio which indicates that the topic might be complicatedeven without concrete details we heard a description of odysseys story setup that could be hinting at the fate of the unselected hero youre on kephallonia and its where you are informed that some member of your family is still alive and you get a contract to kill them game director scott phillips says youre thrown immediately into ooh do i remember that person as a bad person did they do something bad to me do i need to reunite with my family we immediately put you into a dramatic scenario into how do i want my character to perceive these events in my past you go from there and that leads to the next thing which just keeps expandingconsidering the series name no one should be surprised that assassinations are a big part of the assassins creed formula back in assassins creed syndicate implemented a satisfying approach to taking down your key targets giving them specialized setpiece kills these often took more work than the traditional methods but the reward was a unique and intricate scenario crafted for each individual on your hit listin origins assassinations happened more organically playing off the environment and interactions between the people and animals nearby this allowed for plenty of fun and improvised situations but didnt have the same deliberately crafted feel we dont know much yet about the actual targets youre taking down in odyssey but if you look at these two approaches to assassination as two ends of a spectrum where does odyssey fallits not going to be the syndicatestyle we spent hundreds of hours to build this one giant setup for one target phillips says theyre going to use setups that we have built for those sorts of things but its not going to be exclusive to them weve tried to make sure that the targets areactive within the world and also are in interesting locations when you do those assassinations but i would look at it as an upgrade of origins rather than a return to syndicatefor some players assassins creed is all about historical characters and settings for others the modernday struggle between assassins and templars is an intriguing diversion different games have balanced these threads in different ways origins went back to the original approach of giving players a named character layla hassan to control during brief sequences outside of the animus near the end of that game layla met with william miles father of desmond miles odyssey is continuing that arcwere taking laylas story further as to who she is and who she becomes says creative director jonathan dumont we have some surprises in that story as well the goal was to give you a little bit more exploration with her its not a modernday game where we have hours of modern day thats not it but it occupies a larger spot than we had in origins and its more interactive and she goes placesconsidering the significance of the first civilization in odyssey the spear your character uses is a first civilization artifact this creates plenty of potential to connect the events of the past to the current state of the world especially with regard to figures like juno and minervaorigins detailed the beginning of the assassin brotherhood odyssey takes place before that but when we asked if this was the templar origin story in our rapidfire interview we got a no comment that isnt necessarily significant after all any answer to that question yes or no could be a spoiler so with those connections up in the air why is this game called assassins creed how is it related to other installmentswe tie ourselves to things from our brand says dumont we tie ourselves to the first civilization so we have an artifact that you wield we have a continuation of the present day as far as it goes from alexios point of view and kassandras point of view it is a battle between order and chaos there are factions that embody some of these things but are they templar per se well see i dont want to talk too much about it but at the essence of it the conflict between order and freedom there is that for youwell have more solid answers to all of these questions on october when assassins creed odyssey releases on xbox one

rockstar new england thought they were working on the next big rockstar gamethey were excited to push the companys tech and to bring a cult hit into rockstars vision for the future they were excited for the chance to prove themselves as a rockstar studio having recently been purchased by the company they were excited to lead development on bully the sequel to rockstars critically acclaimed openworld adventure about life in a private schoolbut things dont always go as planned and other obligations on a release schedule get in the way of passion projects rockstar new englands bully was shelved in favor of other more troubled projects in development like max payne and red dead redemptionrockstar new england wanted to be sort of the golden child in the rockstar thing but its really hard when rockstar north was the one that was producing all the golden eggs at that time one developer says living in the shadows of someone who casts a big shadow like rockstar north and trying to usurp that role its really difficult and nearly impossible but man did they try oh did they tryto find out what exactly the studio was planning with bully and why it was ultimately let go in favor of other projects we recently spoke to five former employees from rockstars new england studio and one from its new york city headquarters most of whom requested anonymity out of fear of repercussions from rockstar their story is one of shifting company cultures tech that would finally find its way into rockstar games as late as red dead redemption ii and disappointment over the way things wentin the late to rockstar games was on a spending spree after the initial success of its massive series grand theft auto rockstar bought a lot of its thirdparty partner studios one of those studios was dma design renamed rockstar north developer of the first grand theft auto another was angel studios the developer of red dead revolver red dead redemption and the smuggler run and midnight club series which the publisher acquired and renamed rockstar san diegomad doc software founded in andover massachusetts in by former activision technical director ian lane davis was another rockstar acquisition davis holds a doctorate in artificial intelligence and robotics from carnegie mellon university according to former developers game informer spoke to as well as an archived version of mad docs website ai was a core pillar of the studios pedigree the website claimed that the studios team composed of developers who previously worked on franchises like civilization system shock and thief had an unmatched expertise in the fieldfor its first decade mad doc operated on a workforhire basis taking projects for publishers such as activision sierra entertainment disney interactive and vivendi games prior to its purchase by rockstar mad doc mostly developed pc strategy games such as the star trek armada and empire earth seriesempire earth became mad docs bread and butter once the studio took over development on the first games expansion pack the art of conquest though that initial release was met with middling reviews mad docs next two empire earth games empire earth and its expansion the art of supremacy were successful enough to lead to deals with publishers like bethesda softworks and rockstarin october rockstar released bully as a playstation exclusive the game developed by rockstars vancouver studio in canada was a subversion of the formula that had made the publishers games famous where in other rockstar titles like the grand theft auto series players controlled a criminal free to cause mayhem around an openworld city or state bully put players in control of jimmy hopkins a high school student at the bullworth academy boarding school rather than kill people jimmy got in fistfights instead of guns he had stink bombs and slingshots rather than pull off robberies or heists jimmy pulled pranks and went to class coincidentally the game was set in new england mad docs backyardbully was critically and commercially successful receiving the highest possible review scores from outlets like xplay and and a game of the year nomination from gamespot in march taketwo interactive rockstars parent company announced that the game had sold more than million copies for comparison grand theft auto iv released in april sold more than million copies within its first monthback over at mad doc empire earth released in november was critically panned the company was in a tough spot a former mad doc employee says mad doc up until being acquired by rockstar was pretty typical of most independent game studios in that it mostly survived by working on ip from publishers while trying to develop and pitch its own games he saysthose tough times would be alleviated by a new partner rockstar after the success of bully on playstation rockstar approached mad doc about developing bully scholarship edition a remaster with new missions characters and items mad doc led the development of scholarship editions xbox and windows pc versions released in march and october respectively while rockstar toronto developed the wii portin april rockstar announced it had acquired mad doc software for an undisclosed amount and renamed the studio rockstar new england speaking in a news release announcing the acquisition rockstar cofounder and president sam houser said that making mad doc a rockstar studio would enhance our core technology and further support our commitment to creating progressive and innovative gaming experienceswere eager to bring our expertise to bear in the characterdriven openworld stories that make rockstar games titles so uniquely compelling davis who became studio head of rockstar new england after the purchase said in the releaseaccording to developers game informer spoke to opinions on becoming a rockstar studio were positive at the time some staffers such as artist tim samuels were excited by the prospect of making games for one of the biggest developers in the world i thought it was actually really really cool samuels says its like hey rockstar i mean these guys are triplea theyre no on the top we just took it in stride and started workingrockstar itself you say i work at rockstar people were really in awe of that one former developer says it was nice to have some clout to a job you know i was excited to work on anything that they had because most of the games that theyd churned out had been pretty goldenhowever some say that they gradually started to see mad docs workplace culture disappear after the acquisition and that crunch became a more prevalent issue within the studio once it was under the rockstar bannerdont get me wrong during the making of empire earth there was crunch at mad doc but it was handled well says a former developer there were days to make up for it no one was cracking a whip over our heads every now and then we would have fire drills on fridays you could put the fire drills in air quotes because it was really just the producer at the time it was his way of letting us out early there was a much better balance between work and lifeshortly after rockstar purchased mad doc rockstar former vice president of development jeronimo barrera visited the studio the developer continues barrera was there to field employee questions but left some feeling uneasy about their new employerone of the first red flags was when someone asked about hours and weekends and stuff like that the developer recalls jeronimos answer was something to the effect of well we dont work every weekend he like for example im not working this saturday the emphasis on the word every and then this were a little disquieting in their effect in a report from kotaku detailed barrerra reputation within rockstar citing multiple employees describing him as abrasive and volatile one employee also accused barrera of sexual assault while working at rockstar barrera categorically denied all of the allegations of misconductshortly after the purchase developers at rockstar new england began work on numerous projects there was still work to finish on the pc version of scholarship edition but the studio also assisted in the development of other rockstar games such as grand theft auto ivs two story expansions and red dead redemption in addition to support work rockstar new england was given the chance to develop its own game a sequel to bullyaccording to some developers it was a chance to prove themselvesthe late marked a shift in direction for rockstar for much of the companys early history it released games at a rate that cofounder jamie king called relentless sometimes developing or publishing as many as or new releases a year not including ports while the grand theft auto series has been a massive moneymaker for the company since the success of grand theft auto iii the bulk of the publishers library from its first decade was padded out with forgotten games such as surfing austin powers oh behave and state of emergencyafter grand theft auto iv launched in that schedule slowed down while rockstar still released plenty of ports of its older games on new platforms which it continues to do today its number of annual games dropped to one or two after the launch of grand theft auto v in which went on to become one of the most successful entertainment properties of all time rockstar stopped putting out new games on a yearly basis its next tentpole release wouldnt come until five years later with the release of red dead redemption iiin change in the companys release schedule also marked a shift in direction for its games early on rockstar put out a hodgepodge of titles of different genres and qualities but after the publisher began to lean further into more expensive more prestigious releases often focused on an older audience and built around gunplay the company touted the tech behind its games more such as la noires facial capture technology its development budgets sometimes reportedly pushed more than million a new rockstar game became an event something that didnt happen oftenrockstar new englands plan for bully was in line with this vision according to developers on the project it was a chance to let the bully series sit alongside rockstar games of the time such as grand theft auto iv and red dead redemption it was a chance as one former developer recalls to shoot for the moon because even if we dont quite make it were already much further than if we had aimed a little bit lowerthere was a lot of focus on character very deep systems seeing how far we could push that and putting it up there alongside a gta one developer on the project saysi think that they wanted to bring that kind of world to the bully universe another saysfor developers at rockstar new england this meant making the world of bully bigger and deeper than that of the original game and putting a considerable amount of resources into its creation while game informer wasnt able to get an exact number of people working on the project three people say almost the entire studio worked on bully at some point with overall headcount estimations being around to peopleat one point i think it was everybody one former developer says the studio itself that was going to be their gamethree different developers told us that the games openworld map wouldnt have been as big as that of say grand theft auto iv but their estimates on its planned scope describe it as ranging from the size of grand theft auto vice citys open world to three times the size of the original bullys school map what it would have lacked in overall size it would have made up for with depth for example rockstar new england planned to make every building in the game enterable either by normal means or by forced entry if you could see it you could go into it one former developer on the project saysthe player was not going to be driving a car anywhere so the total playable space and land size was definitely going to be smaller another developer says mostly because kids hes not going to be driving and also because we wanted these very deep systems like if you can go into every building thats a lot of work wed rather not have a really massive world maybe scale that back a little bit just so that we can make sure that we have all these meaningful things in therebolstered by rockstar new englands pedigree in artificial intelligence the studio was experimenting with ways to make the players actions more meaningful than in previous rockstar games take for example the honor system in the first red dead redemption if protagonist john marston helps a nonplayer character his honor rating rises but if the player directs marston to commit crimes then marstons honor falls while this affects how npcs react to marston out in the world specific npcs dont remember his individual actionsin bully however rockstar new england was trying to develop ways for characters to remember jimmy for there to be good and bad consequences for his actionswe really wanted to make sure that people remembered what you did so if you pulled a prank on your neighbor theyd remember it says one developer that your actions had more meaning beyond a radius and the fivesecond memories of the nonplayable characters near youparts of this system can be seen in red dead redemption ii two developers tell game informer players see changes in protagonist arthur morgans behavior based on his honor if morgan has high honor hes a more compassionate character if morgan has low honor hes driven by greed and apathy similarly if morgan robs a store he cant just walk back into it a few minutes later as if nothing happened the store clerk remembers morgan and denies him service asking him to leavethe way that you interact with other characters in the world more than just with your gun or with your fist they have some sense of memory a lot of that stuff originated in bully one developer saysfrom what i remember reading in some of the design docs and my conversations with people is that you could build relationships with characters in the world he says about bully youd be like best friends with the chef in the mansion or whatever or the chef could really hate you or something and that would open up different options i dont know to the extent of where that ended up if that got pared down into a general youre good jimmy versus youre bad jimmy or what but i know in some of the early ideas being thrown around you would have that finegrained level of relationships to other characters in the worldbeyond the games open world developers describe a breadth of different interactivity options and new features one detail recalled by two developers was a progressive grassgrowing system where grass throughout the world would grow realistically and players could see individual blades you could go and mow the lawn and then it would actually be lower one former developer says you could actually do a good job go back and forth and create lines on peoples lawns that kind of thingit sounds so silly but it was something that we were all excited about because of the technology behind it another developer says of the grassgrowing mechanicbecause rockstar new england wanted to give players the option to break into houses the team developed a new glass fragmentation system new tech made for bully that hadn been used in prior rockstar games though itd find its way into later titles if youve played max payne and you shot some glass instead of just the glass breaking the same way every time we had built this whole system so that this chunk right near the impact of the first bullet would break out and you would see a little spiderweb of glass one developer says then if you shot some more of the glass little individual chunks near where you actually shot would fall out it made it look realisticmultiple people on the project describe an indepth climbing mechanic planned for the game when exploring the open world jimmy would be able to climb trees fences and ledges on top of roofs as well as out of his window when sneaking out trees were obviously a big one we wanted the player to be able to climb up the tree to hide or do some hijinks with all sorts of things like paintball guns or water balloons all of that sort of stuff a former developer sayswhile the developers put a lot of work into figuring out how the climbing would be implemented in bully they never got far enough into development to completely nail it down according to three former developers on the projectwe worked with a lot of gta assets just so that we could get something prototyped quickly one developer says about the climbing we tried to work a lot of that in its like well when hes hanging for this long how long does he hang for before he lets go do we wanna do a footoverfoot balancing act if youre walking along a branch versus side stepping side to side if you were working along the branch but to the side it was stuff like that and trying to figure out what worked or what looked the best as the playerhousing these new features was a vertical slice of bully that rockstar new england had up and running according to four developers at the studio and one person at rockstars new york city headquarters bully was playable developers could run around the world and interact with objects and nonplayer characters and there were some missions such as one involving gokarts another with a beekeeper a kamp krustystyle mission and one that had jimmy in his underwear even featuring a crotch bulgeit was definitely going to be a little risqu a former developer saysthere were a lot of movies like goonies that came up as reference porkys was another commonly used movie for reference he says we looked at a lot of those kinds of things its definitely in that styleas one developer on the project recalls the team had mapped out all the terrain for the games world additionally npcs were walking around doing various daytoday tasks buildings and houses within the game were also starting to become featurecomplete though he points out that they werent in a shippable form yetthe game was at least six to eight hours playable says marc anthony rodriguez a former game analyst for rockstars new york city headquarters and one of the project leads on bully scholarship edition so fully rendered fully realizedthat sounds about right for the size of vertical slice that rockstar projects were being built around at that time a second source says when asked about whether during his time working on the project the game was playable for six to eight hourstwo developers game informer spoke to estimate that if development had continued bully would still have needed two to three or more years before being ready to be shippedbut those years wouldnt come over time rockstar began pulling people off the project and putting them on other indevelopment games that needed help for the developers game informer spoke to once anyone got pulled off of bully they never returnednone of the developers game informer spoke to knows exactly why rockstar new england was chosen to develop bully though its worth pointing out that rockstar vancouver developer of the first bully was leading development on max payne at this time the developers say they felt that the opportunity to work on bully was a chance to prove that rockstar new england was worth the money rockstar had spent to acquire it which was a sentiment shared by employees at other studios purchased by the company around the same timei mean thats a pretty common thing that ill refer to them as new york the new york office kind of asks of any new rockstar studio is for them to prove that theyre worth the investment one exbully developer saysrodriguez echoes this sentiment saying the bully project was new englands heavy lift for rockstar though he admits the studio had a history with the company before the acquisition this was not their first rodeo with working with rockstar rodriguez says the only way i could state it is they had a proven track record and that was the only reason they were acquiredthe main acquisition was to have a foothold that was closer than rockstar north and that was going to be able to handle the ai aspect of what the interaction within this game was going to be the communication tools within this game he adds mad doc wasnt like something to fing turn your nose up atrockstar declined to participate in this story all other interview requests game informer sent to current or former members of the new york office were either ignored or turned downregardless of the why behind it former developers on the project describe a lot of excitement for the chance to develop a sequel to bully it was really just lets do everything that theyre asking really well because we want to impress these folks one former developer saysthere were some late nights for sure staying until midnight in the morning says another developer on the project we were hustling to prove ourselves because i think just about anybody working on bully just absolutely loved it it was certainly a labor of love by just about anybody that was working on it i think most of the people that worked on it look back on it fondly and kind of wistfully wishing that it wouldve worked outbut rockstar had other priorities there were other games in the company pipeline that needed help and attention in rockstar new england began pulling people off of bully developers say having them focus solely on projects like max payne point in rockstar new englands history marks a decided shift in tone while most developers speak fondly and excitedly about their work on bully when talking about projects such as max payne and red dead redemption their tone turns dourthe developers make two main points regarding this specific time in rockstar new englands history one is the crunch developers describe monthslong crunch periods where theyd have to work late into the night and on weekends sometimes between and days others describe joining a project only to immediately start crunching or crunching on one project just to be rolled onto another project and having to crunch on that one too one developer speaking to game informer uses the word endless to describe the crunch at the studioi mean it was just ridiculous one former developer says describing the development of red dead redemption i know that it won game of the year and that was great and satisfying but the approach to development was just it was ridiculous it took no ones life outside of work into accountyou know usually youre like oh ive gotta get this out we wanna try and hit this another developer says so everybody works really hard for like a week two weeks but then when the milestone ended theyre like well lets try and preemptively fix the things that we know that theyre going to say so well just keep crunching until we get word back and then we wouldnt get word back for six more weeks or something like that so people were kind of breaking it was breaking people quicklythe other thing developers bring up is a culture change within rockstar new england it wasnt instant they say and wasnt much of a problem on bully but three developers game informer spoke with say that as time went on the studio got further from the culture that had attracted them to join mad doc softwareas some developers describe it they felt they were expected by other people within the company to prove their dedication to rockstar through long hours and that they would be harassed when trying to leave the studio when it came time for you to leave it was a lot of just trying to get out without being harassed on the way out of the door one former developer tells game informerthe culture just it just changed another former developer says i saw people that previously i really liked become just sycophantic and then there was the whole bodies in chairs thing you know you dont have work to do but youre going to be here on the weekend because theres some studio head thats going to be walking around this doesnt even get into the offwork hours stuff where it was just it was like a hardworking frat house there is an age and a person that is really drawn to that rockstar in my opinion is well aware of thissome of the developers game informer spoke to describe how they decided to leave the studio as the workload increased and the culture kept changing one describes it as voting with his feetothers had that decision made for themin june rockstar new england went through a sizable layoff sources within the studio told kotaku that at least percent of the studio had been let go this included the entirety of the quality assurance department as rockstar shifted all of its qa to a dedicated studio members of the studios art team and other departments were also let goat the time of the layoffs outlets reported that rockstar would help those affected find new jobs according to artist tim samuels who lost his job in this round of layoffs that didnt actually happen he also says he wasnt told why he was being let go due to the timing of the cuts before the release of red dead redemption which was the last project that samuels and others affected by the layoffs had worked on none of them received bonuses for their work we didnt even get a copy of the game samuels saysthat layoff was pretty devastating to a lot of people in the studio and stuck with me even after i had left says one developer who spoke to game informer anonymously it never really made much sense to me as to why it happened and i dont recall there ever being an official explanationas of february rockstar had shipped more than million copies of red dead redemption its considered one of the best games ever made in april kotaku reported that rockstar was taking steps to address its crunch problems across all of its studiosover the years news of bully development has spread around the game industry higherups at rockstar have also talked several times about their interest in the seriesin shawn lee composer on the first bully told the gaming liberty it looks like i will be doing the soundtrack for bully in the not so distant future in dan houser told gamasutra that the company might work on bully after it released max payne which ended up launching in may in houser told polygon he wanted to make a bully sequel theres a lot of directions i could go with that one he said in february rockstar announced that houser would be leaving the company the following monththere have also been a small number of reports and leaks about the development of bully in the twitter account bully info posted numerous pieces of supposed concept art and ingame screenshots according to game informers contacts the large majority of those leaks are legitimate in july youtuber swegta uploaded a video based on a conversation with a former rockstar new england employee about bully and rockstar games decision to shelve the project in in october vgc published a report about the game saying the project was in development at rockstar new england for between and months before fizzling out the report said that while dan houser had a script and story outline as early as development at new england occurred sometime between red dead redemptions release in and the end of that roughly lines up with what game informer has heard though developers we talked to say they remember the game being in development between and before the release of red dead redemptionrockstar games has never said anything publicly about bully being in development we werent able to confirm whether there was anyone at rockstar new england or any other rockstar studio still working on the project although one developer says a build of the game still existed at rockstar new england as recently as a few years ago parts of which were used as reference material for later projectswe dont know if a version of bully will ever see the light of day but a decade after development people that worked on the project still express fondness for the game and their work and they say they still hope theyll get a chance to play a full releaseit was going to be really cool one former developer says what we had was pretty amazing especially given the very short amount of time that we were working on it it certainly wouldve been very unique very interesting certainly a lot of fun a lot of cool and interesting mechanics that we were working on that still arent in other gamesits still a concept in my opinion worth exploring another says and i think that it would be a missed opportunity for them to let it go

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/12/meet-the-new-characters-of-saints-row,Meet The New Characters Of Saints Row,the saints row series began in introducing players to a beloved cast of characters over the subsequentdecade after saints row iv where players entered a computer simulation to battle aliens saints row gat out of hell where players literally descended into the depths of the underworldto fight satan volition knew it had taken the series to the farthest reaches following gat out of hell volition took a break from saints rowthe series had reached a natural resting point and rather than continually try to oneup the previous entry with zanier scenarios and more bombastic characters volition went back to the drawing boardit was never spoken out loud with clarity of something like this is it we have specifically taken this as far as we would like and when we do the next game by god were going to reboot it volition chief creative officer jim boone says but i think that everyone had that vibe that we just had fun taking this thing as far as we possibly could and leaving it all out thereafter putting the series temporarily on ice volition developed agents of mayhem the game featured much of the saints row dna but fans clamored for the return of the studios most popular franchise the groundswell of community enthusiasm combined with the studios own passion for the franchise to drive them back to saints row however the team didnt want to just continue down the path it was going stretching further and further into the realm of absurdityvolition considered options like flashing back to a time before saints row iv but the most viable option was to reboot the series not only did this give the team a clean slate but also a fresh story to tellthis approach allows us to build on top of it narrative designer jennifer campbell says once you add everything and the kitchen sink to the game its difficult to then plan for future games after that because if you start with the climax where do you go from there a lot of fans have been wanting us to go back to a more grounded game we were trying to set up this reboot for its best chance for evolutionwith that direction in place volition decided to create a new cast of characters so that it could tell the origin story of a new group of saints who hail from a new city inspired by the american southwest the initial class of santo ilesos saints includes four characters from disparate backgrounds the customizable protagonist who later becomes known as the boss starts out in marshall a techheavy highly trained faction meanwhile neenah gets her start in los panterosand kevin comes from the idols the other two rival gangs found in santo ilesoit turns out lowlevel members of street gangs dont make a whole lot of money and apartments arent cheap so they decide to put their rival affiliations aside in the name of saving money on rent though this seemingly doomedtofail roommate situation leads to some initial conflict among them they quickly establish a policy of leaving work at the door when they come home theyre joined by their fourth roommate eli who

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/05/31/double-fines-approach-to-crunch-and-labor,Double Fine's Approach To Crunch And Labor,double fine founder tim schafer used to tell people he didn have any regrets he been able to make all the things he wanted to make but as he got older his feelings changed in his career schafer both participated in and encouraged brutal periods of crunch on various game development projects reflecting on it now he says he has a lot of regrets about what he put his teams throughwhen it just yourself you can throw yourself against the task as hard as you can schafer says day and all night i going to push this rock ahhh i going to give it my all and then as i got more into a role where i was managing and designing and there were other people doing the gameplay programming stuff now you pushing on a soft person who against the rock so you can like squish them and kill them if you push too hardschafer career began in the nascent years of the game industry his first job was at lucasarts the game development division of lucasfilm in while many large companies made games at this time schafer worked for george lucas company after all video games were still a hobbyist medium made for and by hobbyists common labor practices of other industries weren present in the burgeoning game industry which was full of people making tentpole games at home with friends such as the original doom developed by id software and released in the time working day and night on video games even at the cost of personal wellness was just what game developers did as schafer tells it it never occurred to himto be upset over the hours he put in at lucasarts working on pointandclick adventure games such as escape from monkey island day of the tentacle grim fandango and full throttle schafer worked countless hours because that was the jobi had no life schafer recalls i was working on grim fandango until like three at night seven days a week all i did was be in the office writing dialogue all the timeit worth pointing out schafer still speaks highly of his time at lucasarts in a lot of ways it made his career he also says that if he wasn working on the games he would have just gone home watched tv and ate chinese food like it not that big a loss schafer says about the time but in schafer left lucasarts and founded his own studio double fine productions the first game the company worked on the cult classic psychonauts had an abysmal development cycle in fact the grim crunch mode was nothing compared to the psychonauts crunch mode schafer says so it got even worse just like you would imaginemore than years later schafer and members of the development team still talk about how miserable the production was at times a big issue was as a brandnew studio the team had little experience with platformers it was also making its own engine at the time and learning at a basic level what kind of company double fine even was while ultimately the finished product turned out great and the team still speaks fondly about the completedgame the making of psychonauts fundamentally altered double fine forever starting on the company second project brtal legend schafer claims double fine tried to fight and curb crunch modes entirely we really reduced it on each project he says we been able to bring it down and mostly get rid of itwhenever there crunch mode it means a mistake has been made somewhere schafer saysfor the last several years crunch has been a hotbutton topic in the game industry as games get harder to make and opinions on worklife balance change many studios have been called out for their labor practices rockstar games naughty dog cd projekt red and many other massive game companies have all come under firewhen it comes to crunch where the game industry used to be full of young people making games in their homes it now a billiondollar global industry employing hundreds of thousands of people in a lot of ways the labor expectations of decades past when a game was made by a few people haven scaled to meet the dynamic and changing needs of a workforce of thousands of developers who all have their own private lives needs and backgrounds the game industry has yet to successfully unionize either which could better protect employees from exploitative labor practices such as crunchthe fact that a company like double fine is being as frank as it is about crunch and labor with the press and with its own employees is sadly rarer than it should be outside of exposs crunch is often a hidden issue kept away from the public eyedouble fine is not only frank about its own issues with crunch and hopeful solutions but some people within the company don exactly pull punches when talking about crunch within the game industry at largei feel like the industry kind of just leans on that schafer says i think that where it actually evil when you know your big company kind of banks on that and they know they going to lay off the team afterward so it just doesn matter what they do to morale you know so that where the problems come fromi do feel that when i worked at other companies and i not going to name any names i do feel like there were times where the culture and the fundamental planning for a game was built around making people work to hours a week for months on end and that was built into the schedule adds double fine artist lee petty that was extremely prevalent in the industry it still is it less prevalent and now it gets hidden and lied about in various ways that terrible that a terrible cost to a human beingat double fine mitigating crunch essentially comes down to planning and money on a game like brtal legend for example the company partnered with its publisher ea a move schafer says was to secure the money double fine needed for the ambitious scope of the project without having to crunch the team to meet those demands more recently before it was acquired by microsoft in double fine cut the boss fights from psychonauts because it didn have the resources to finish those gameplay sequences something it was able to reimplement after the buyoutschafer disputes the idea that crunch is inevitable but it is something a studio needs to prioritize human beings work for game development studios and guaranteeing their qualityoflife not sacrificing it for a commercial product is part of running and managing a companyyou have to see that dial as not moveable schafer says you like okay we up against the gun the schedule can move because the marketing plans are in order the quality can move because we can make something bad the budget there no more money you can move these dials well there the quality of life of the team dial let just move that way down and then we get all this more time people always see that as a dial that movable because you have the authority to make people feel like they should work you just have to set that as a rule that that not movable either in the end you often move all the dials a little bit you get a little bit more money little more time or you plan better so you don have to do these kinds of tradeoffspetty whos worked in the game industry for years and been with double fine since brtal legend says he seen psychonauts handled better than any project before it at double fine schafer and other management have made avoiding cruncha top priority he says and while he feels great about that movement he adds i feel like there always improvement that can be donethese points are all echoed by newer members of double fine staff during a recent period of burnout content and community manager harper jay who also wrote about crunch during her time as a journalist for kotaku was told by her boss to take time off and i think in other places if you were working in business unit c of ward nine whatever that just wouldn happen jay says but here it a thing that can happen because people do look out for each otherother employees bring up similar stories being told to take time off by bosses or superiors when they put extra time in on a project similarly sometimes if someone is staying at work late they will also be told to just go homethe only time i ever stayed late is because i personally was like really want to get this thing done says senior systems programmer aaron jacobsin those few cases when that has happened and i have decided to stay late i will at the time often get pressure from people to go homewhile double fine has certainly found a better balance in this area that not to say the studio isperfect and there isn room for improvement challenges continue to arise especially in the last year when the workforce shifted to working from home due to the ongoing global pandemic it harder to keep an eye on every employee when they no longer sitting next to you in an office if someone does a bit of extra work at night instead of watching netflix does that count as crunch what if someone works better at night than they do during normal work hours do you try and mitigate that as double fine keeps addressing its relationship to crunch while also navigating a changing world these are the questions newer employees bring up when asked about double fine labor practices on top of whether a project inherently encourages crunch despite management best effortsi think there are ways to improve says senior concept artist gianna ruggiero even though we are a culture that we don condone crunch is the project itself making it stressful for people to feel like they need to crunch and if that is happening how are we addressing that and i don think that something that double fine is that aware of yetpsychonauts we keep extending when this thing is coming out ruggiero continues and there are reasons for that and there are stresses on people that something that i think we could be better at doing is understanding and mitigating those stresses on peopleit stands to reason that after years of striving to limit crunch double fine will continue to reevaluate reassess and work on its relationship with labor going forward talking to people from the studio especially on psychonauts it seems to be a sizable pillar of the company overall culture and development philosophies schafer admits he is still learning it an ongoing process but at the very least where other companies have often failed double fine has created a workplace that tries to put the individual needs of its employees first it a game development studio making commercial products but that studio is made of human beings that not lost on the brass within double finei think prioritizing people is something that double fine does a good job at says environment artist janice bell because it just feels like a lot of other studios see their people as assets where double fine is the first studio i worked at where they actually see you as people important parts of the studio with views that matter and input that matters,en,296.0,Positive

site with information about the game on our latest cover assassins creed odyssey in addition to the print feature that subscribers can read weve had indepth features on mercenaries a look at some of the gameplay loops you can participate in and a blast of rapidfire questions with the games director not everything we learn during our studio visit fits neatly into a larger feature though rather than leave those little tidbits in the shadows weve compiled some of the most interesting nuggets and are sharing them with youre going to get to know the historian herodotus over the course of your journey herodotus goes along with you on the main path for a while and then he ends up on your ship and stays with you says scott phillips game director of assassins creed odyssey hold up whos herodotus again he is well known for recording the events of the wars and going around to different cultures so we have a better idea of who the greeks were and how they lived and beyond says narrative director melissa maccoubrey he is very good at chronicling those and then he has an entry about giant ants that mine gold herodotus will even record your adventures though it remains to be seen where they land on the spectrum between history and giant the player character was exiled as a child and early in the game they learn that members of their family may still be alive if you are able to reunite it looks like theres a possibility it could end well if you can recover your family members they can join you on the ship phillips says referring to your vessel that acts as your mobile while your characters adventure starts with a personal motivation the story eventually expands in scope continuing even after that familyreunion thread has been resolved the main story with your family is just one of them and there are others that have a bigger impact on the overall story and the overall universe phillips says your story with your family will have a conclusion but there are other stories with your character that are more of his or her real conclusion than just the story with your odyssey is changing the way players interact with consumables such as health potions and tools of distraction instead of crafting onetimeuse items with materials players can map abilities that function the same to face buttons which operate on cooldowns healing we wanted it to be a little more upgradable and the smoke bomb felt better on an ability says creative director jonathan dumont there are a lot of places where you can spend money on in our game and rather than spending it on consumables or looting them it felt better to have it in your you dont have to look at your helmet if you dont want to you can toggle the headgear so even if youre wearing headgear you still get the bonuses even if you dont see it maccoubrey says we knew this from our previous handson but dumont had a funny response when we asked about helmets with great stats that look goofy we have some of those we have a few of those actually but i wear them because those are the ones i like it looks like somebody puts a pan on my head but i kind of like the world is almost entirely open from the beginning if you start the game and you say i want to go over there you can maccoubrey says theyre not blocked off somebody might kick your ass but youre not prohibited from going the game has enemy scaling so players wont run into the same issues that they did when assassins creed origins launched you never burn a zone come back and its level when youre level dumont says we have a system that will catch up but never there are different citystates within the game and each one has a different theme or overall feel say were near delphi and its all about the gods and their reverence for the gods dumont says if you move down here to arkadia its more about agriculture and youll start to have a different vibe if youre not interested in those stories theres other stuff to do and other places to go if youre super interested in those stories then you have a lot to look at if you go more toward athens then its going to be a little bit more about politics science arts and philosophy dumont says one area in particularly hilarious though he wouldnt history remains an important element of the series which shouldnt come as any kind of a surprise still odysseys historical setting is ripe for some interesting and grim story moments we did a lot of research as to how historical events played out and those events are depicted as accurately as we can find out maccoubrey says it was very important for us to keep them that way an example would be the plague of athens happens during our time period we do a lot of research about what happened during the plague how the plague started who was there in athens at that time what were the rumors about it that kind of thing and then depicted it that sokrates has been given special attention we knew he couldnt feel like any other quest giver hes sokrates maccoubrey says hes probably our most famous character that we have he needed to be special if you want to engage and go down the rabbit hole with him he is very happy to do that and if you want to tell him man im not here for this he also responds to that hes a little unphased by it but hell get you to try to do it your character struggles with their place in the world and their abilities you get to play with one of the themes that we have in the game overall which is the idea of a greek hero maccoubrey says that idea of the fact that you stand out from the rest of the crowd in being a fairly mighty warrior with an eagle that people think is the eagle of zeus that inner conflict that kassandra and alexios have about am i special or am i just a person where do i fit in this player choice is a big part of the game and more than hours of interactive cutscenes have been incorporated into odyssey if you arent particularly into story well thats a choice too as a narrative director i would be lying if i said that i didnt care if people didnt resonate with story and didnt want to experience story because i think that story is very important to establish a connection between the player and the game maccoubrey says but i do understand very much that for some people story is something that they dont want to get invested in so we do accommodate players in the way that yes they still have to interact with dialogue in order to progress through the story but you can skip through dialogue as youre going through theres always a pushthrough option to make sure you can get through dialogue and you can skip through weather is dynamic and beautiful if you dont mind getting wet as you travel around youll come across different atmospheres and youll hit some places that are foggy some places that are rainy some places that are stormy because we have reintroduced a full weather system into odyssey says world director ben hall so youll see the sunbleached skies but youll also see the thunderstorms on the ocean and the waves and everything its pretty dramatic and pretty cool and it all happens with origins ubisoft montreal shifted away from the reactive counterfocused combat from previous assassins creed games in favor of a more aggressive actionbased system phillips says the fact that your character has a first civilization artifact in odyssey changes combat even further you have the spear of leonidas which allows you to parry youre going to be parrying much more often but we wanted you to be dodging rolling moving around the fight much more often than you might have in assassins creed origins the pace of the combat is a little bit quicker you need to be a little more reactive within the fight at the players square off with several different factions in assassins creed odyssey weve got the spartans which are sort of the more crazed upclose dangerous fighters phillips says they will go berserk and do more damage when they get low on health weve got the athenians which are a bit more tactical they will use archers and shields bandits will be ever present attacking everyone and they use quick get in get out move fast and get away tactics and then we have what we initially called micro factions the daughters of artemis follow the goddess of the hunt and they see themselves as protectors of animals using pets like bears to keep forests safe the followers of ares are a crazed cult that does the opposite sacrificing animals in the name of the god of war theyre really nuts to fight phillips says then there are the cultist

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/05/21/how-double-fine-handles-mental-health-in-psychonauts-2,How Double Fine Handles Mental Health In Psychonauts 2,the psychonauts series is about going inside people minds and all the good and bad that entails that is tricky territory to explore as people are susceptible to falling on outdated views or harmful stereotypes about the nature of mental illnesses and the people who suffer from them with psychonauts developer double fine made the decision to work with a mental health expert to ensure it explored these themes in a respectful waydouble fine is working with dr raffael boccamazzo a doctor of clinical psychology and the clinical director at take this a nonprofit established to promote mental health in the game industry that works to ensure that these sensitive topics are approached inthe right ways its an easy thing to get wrong especially if you relying on outdated tropes such as the dangerous asylum inmate as seen in games like the outlast seriespeople with serious mental health challenges are more likely to be victims than victimizers boccamazzo says there are of course exceptions to every rule but statistically speaking that the case and so the idea of someone with mental health challenges always being violent that a common thing in a lot of horror games movies books that isn necessarily representational of realitywhen working with a game developer boccamazzo says his time on a project varies gamebygame on psychonauts he been on the project for two or three months he wasn involved in the writing process but was brought on to look over the content of the game and make sure double fine had done well according to boccamazzo even before he joined the project double fine had done a better job than most with its representation of mental health when he had suggestions for changes double fine was receptive to making edits when it could something boccamazzo says is not always the case with every game developergoing into people minds changing the way they think or behave raises a lot of concerns around the nature of consent raz the protagonist of the psychonauts series has this power so double fine wanted to make sure the character wasn acting with impunity that raz wasn taking his psychic abilities for grantedbecause of the power you know the ability to create connections and change thoughts that not a lowlevel power that can be abused really easily boccamazzo says and one of the things tim schafer founder of double fine and psychonauts director made clear very quickly is that that was something they wanted to handle with carethe flipside of this entire subject is that psychonauts like a lot of media is not rooted in reality there are certain concessions that need to be made when bridging the gap between scientific accuracy and a fantastical world one example boccamazzo brings up is the contested theory that the tyrannosaurus rex wasn a predator but rather a scavenger for a movie like jurassic park this simply isn as exciting as a beast that constantly hunts its prey whatever the truth might be sometimes fiction trumps facts same with psychonauts but only to a pointobviously this is a fantastical surreal world where people are jumping through doors into people minds boccamazzo says so the idea of scientific accuracy in that case has it gonna go out the window a bit but double fine was really concerned more about sensitivity and showing these things in a way that was hopeful and helpful and in that respect i think they did a pretty decent jobthat not to say it always one or the other though in the psychonauts universe abstract concepts are often given physical manifestations for example one collectible called mental baggage is shown as a literal bag in psychonauts panic attacks and bad ideas are two common enemies for boccamazzo who suffers from the former he says he likes the artistic slant in bringing some of these issues to lifeschafer says he thinks all video games should be reviewed by experts such as boccamazzo all developers have blind spots and schafer thinks it important to try and avoid hurting people when you not meaning to along with boccamazzo double fine has also been working with microsoft internal mental health experts to review psychonauts in fact boccamazzo goes out of his way to praise both parties proactiveness when tackling mental health subjects responsibily after our interview he even sent along a video expanding his thoughts which we embed belowpsychonauts tackles some heavy subjects in the level we saw during our cover story interviews the topic of addiction was explored relatively thoroughly while we don know specifics the studio is tacklingother mental health challenges throughout the game boccamazzo thinks it could be easy to take these subjects and create a dour experience one that feels hopeless but double fine is trying to create a game that confrontschallenging topics while being hopeful and helpful this is not to say that it gets everything perfect but the studio is trying to do its due diligence when approaching the themes of its storywhen you representing anything in a game that sensitive it about basing it in our reality instead of stereotypes about it schafer says so you can pull in a lot of reference for real experiences you know and real science and real reference for how to represent that kind of stuff i sure we still get a bunch of stuff wrong but the intentions are always good,en,399.0,Positive
gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/08/26/the-impressive-new-tech-behind-call-of-duty-modern-warfare,The Impressive New Tech Behind Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare,with call of duty modern warfare infinity ward is showcasing impressive tech through a new engine that is able to deliver photorealistic character models and gorgeous scenery within gameplay the engine has been slowly making itself apparent through infinity ward recent games like call of duty infinite warfare and call of duty modern warfare remasteredin fact seeing the early parts of this engine through those games was one of the main motivating factors for current studio art director joel emslie return to the studio i looked at remastered and i looked at infinite warfare and i was like man the production value of this game he says theres so much potential and this new engine was five years in development parts of that engine were alive and well in infinite warfare and you could see itwe spoke with michal drobot principal rendering engineer at infinity ward poland about the tech his team created for call of duty modern warfaregame informer we understand the call of duty series engine is always evolving can you explain whats different here are things being rebuilt from scratch or is this just a big leapmichal drobot we need to go back in time before our previous release at that time the infinity ward team realized that the engine in its form could not really scale further as is new features or systems were resulting in cumbersome boltons and not always playing very well with the rest of the existing tech it is not even about so called tech debt where a development team consciously decides to sacrifice robustness in favor of performance or bug fixes under time pressure but rather some fundamental design decisions that served their purpose welli was brought on board along with many great engineers with a task of taking care of longterm infinity ward engine rendering architecture to make sure it will be able to scale and excel in the future it became clear quite quickly that we needed to scrap or fundamentally rewrite pretty much everything rendering related and as you can imagine this is not something you can do quickly while shipping a game of this franchises scale certain parts of the engine went through a full rewrite for infinite warfare such as the lighting engine while others were retrofitted to somewhat still work with new pieces that was the moment when you could see the big leap in quality but we had so much more to dothe initial plan was to hit infliction point at the mark exactly for the launch of modern warfare after infinite warfare we focused on rearchitecture of all the other systems essentially rewriting them from scratch while letting the production team prototype and rely on the foundation built for our last shipped title then we reached critical mass when technology could finally evolve fast it is fantastic when you see it you wait for years meticulously recreating some basic things in the engine and then suddenly at a specific point it all starts to work together and you jump years ahead of what you could have achieved before it is truly a revolutionary moment for the whole team and modern warfare is the first fruit of that revolutionwhats the oldest bit of code youve noticed in call of dutys engine prior to this gameit is more of an anecdote but for many years we had this one rendering system responsible for setting some lowlevel data variables for draw calls singular rendering subroutines it was extremely efficient but somewhat risky to extend and very rigid it actually had a comment in code that read something like please rewrite this right after ship i believe it stayed in code for way more than a single project until finally for modern warfare we had to man up and rewrite it for real basically the amount of data we are pumping right now into each draw call was significantly beyond that systems capabilities now it is way more flexible and much faster due to working better with new engine architecturewill this tech also be used by all other call of duty studios moving into the futurewe are currently focused on modern warfare therefore it is a bit too soon to talk about what comes nextit seems odd to reinvent so much of call of dutys tech right before the next generation of hardware are you confident this technology will be futureproofour technology horizon is quite far ahead and ever adjusting to whatever comes next the whole point was to rely on highly scalable technology where algorithms hardware insight and quality engineering comes first as opposed to being overly reliant on specific platform features obviously during the optimization phase for any shipping title we do highly focused optimizations to make sure we are taking the best approach for specific hardware but that is the final polish pass not the foundation with this approach we are very confident in our engine ability to adapt to any future hardwarecan you talk about the biggest challenges in shaking up call of dutys tech how difficult is it to reinvent the technology when the series never stops moving and you have a concrete ship date in mindi think you hit the nail on the head here reinventing the technology that drives call of duty while making a new call of duty game is the biggest challenge it requires excellent planning trust between departments as well as a group of extremely talented people who are not afraid to change the course when they see an obstacle ahead i think this process of balancing out tech development and production is the biggest challenge from my experience ive seen it go sideways so many times before in my career you guys go out there and make a new engine come back in a few years and lets ship a game when you hear this you know there will be a year of excitement followed by a year of tears and maybe even canceled projects technology can evolve in isolation without constant iteration cycles with production teams also it can be fully driven by production because then it will end up rigid tightly fitted to the one and only title it is supposed to ship sometimes being not flexible enough to even elevate the project to its potential heights right before the finish line striking a balance here is a tough act that requires everyone to be on board and i truly believe we hit that mark for modern warfaredid you worry about shaking things up too much and slowing down developmentthere is always a risk of slowdown due to the initial cost of progress therefore it was crucial to make sure that all planning for the project content development was well understood ahead and matched different pushes on engineering to give you an example we would do the riskiest changes affecting art production when the project was mostly in preproduction thus the number of affected artists was minimal this would go handinhand with tech art research and development to make sure all effort put into the engine will translate into better visuals and efficiency once the main production team hits the floor running at the end of the day what is important is the throughput of the team throughout the production years and that was always the main focus for uscan you give examples of the communications you regularly have with the development team in californiai think it would be unfair to distinguish communications as something happening between teams we operate as one big team we are just spread out in terms of physical location obviously there is an additional hurdle of operating in multiple time zones but this actually works to our advantage as the engineering team can provide almost coverage and support furthermore we have a lot of people flying back and forth between all our locations which definitely helps in team building and guarantees everyone feels like part of the same big familywhats the single biggest difference players will notice about the new tech when they get their hands on the gamei think the general bar for photorealism has been pushed really far it is just that the scenes feel very much alive and make a great impression as a whole picture this drastic improvement is therefore mostly driven by material and lighting systems so i would bet that those would get the first spotlightwhat does the new tech mean for ai in the gamethis is more of a question for ai team however on the pure rendering side of things we have some very significant improvements to how ai actors perceive lighting in game in short ai can see light and shadows exactly the same way as players do this leads to significantly more reactive ai as well as more emergent behaviors when dealing with light and shade situations where visibility would play a significant role in gameplay experience you can clearly see this when using nvg nightvision goggles or fighting against nvgequipped aicall of duty modern warfare launches on

covered in a previous look at marvel midnight suns you play as the hunter this allnew hero is sought out by an allstar cast of marvel characters and awakened to help fight off the evil entity known as lilith but why is lilith so important that she requires the combined powers of marvel most powerful heroes in addition to an ancient legendary warrior we spoke to the team at firaxis games to learn more about the menacing villainlilith was once a warrior of light as a member of a race called the blood she is a descendant of the elder gods and fought the forces of darkness alongside her sister caretaker for thousands of years during the late lilith sold her soul to a corrupted evil elder god named chthon in a moment of weaknessyour best villains in their mind they not evil they doing something for good but her motivations for her fall are actually very personal and very tragic director of narrative chad rocco sayschthon is so evil that he was banished to another dimension by his fellow gods billions of years ago but he has kept hissights on returning to earth ever since following this dark deal lilith is corrupted by chthon and she gives in to the darkness she creates a monstrous demonic army known as the lilin and she wages war on humanity according to legend this invasion becomes the heart of the salem witch trials the only thing that stops her from her goalsis a team of heroes known as the midnight suns led by a great warrior called the huntertogether the team defeats lilith and seals her away for centuries the midnight suns hid her body and scattered the pages of the darkhold an evil grimoire authored by chthon across the planet however hydra spent several hundred yearshunting down the pages and searching for lilith tomb at present day they have one page left to find and with the time of prophecy just months away they stumble upon lilith tomb hydra dr faustus and his team use a combination of the darkhold and gamma science to resurrect lilith but lilith immediately subjugates the hydra forces and takes control to again try and fulfill the prophecywhile she may not have the name recognition of thanos or apocalypse she an omegalevel threat that perhaps even exceeds their power she commands the lilin but her army is far more dangerous than simply a horde of faceless nameless minions using her power lilith can corrupt even strongwilled powerful people and creatures these dark characters are known as the fallen iconic heroes and villains from across the marvel universe who have been corrupted by lilith and bent to her willwe are telling this epic worldending storyline so it was very important for us to have a large roster of recognizable villains for the heroes to fight against creative director jake solomon says this is what makes lilith so dangerous picture your favorite omegalevel supervillain in marvel you know thanos or apocalypse or ultron or doomlilith is all of that and then some not only does she have godlike powers that grow stronger every daynot only does she have the lilin an unending army of demons at her disposal that the heroes are going to have to fight through but with a single touch lilith can corrupt and command any villain or hero in the marvel universewith so many powers at her fingertipseven the strongest characters in marvel stableare capable of falling tolilithit becomes a question of are you going to beat somebody like that says solomon the problem is whoever you send at lilith has a very good chance of coming back to you with glowing green eyes and an love lilith sticker she not like any villain you seen before in marvel that a theme for us we want to tell different stories we want to show players adifferent side of even characters they know even the fallen they new versions of villains or heroes that you may recognize but now they have new powerswith hydra the lilin and the fallen under her control lilith stages an assault on doctor strange sanctum sanctorum strange captain marvel iron man and a young scarlet witch narrowly survive the attack and the sanctum along with its priceless artifacts fall into the hands of lilith this is the catalyst for the heroes to come together seek out the modern midnight suns and resurrect the hunterlilith is known as the mother of demons but she also the mother of the hunter this lineage gives the hunter their power and while the hunter will stop at nothing to defeat lilith lilith has a different perspective on their relationship i love that the hunter and lilith have a very asymmetric relationship solomon says the hunter is like evil i here to destroy you and then lilith is like love you you my child it just makes her a very interesting villain where she like just misguided you my child and i love you and i want us to be together and that makes a very interesting relationship to start the game off on the right footit a story about a mother and a child rocco says lilith and the hunter may be opposed to one another but there a powerful connection between them and it continues to develop across the gamewhile lilith is beyond powerful her resurrection is merely a stepping stone towards hydra ultimate goal summoning chthon because of the evil elder god role in writing the darkhold the wicked texthas a will of its own and twists those under its influence including lilith to fulfill the prophecy and restore chthon to earth according to this prophecy if the darkhold is read under a onceinabillionyear celestial event known as the midnight sun chthon will be able to return to earthbut why is that such a bad thing the fallen elder god wants nothing more than to consume corrupt and envelop the planet however before that can happen lilith must complete her own mission of corruption so the midnight suns have their own window of opportunity to fight alongside the hunter and stop chthon before he even restoredwe have to wait and see how the midnight suns and the hunter take on the

Year,it the most wonderful time of the year the holidays if you reading this i not at work right now and it great my brain is happily free of thoughts about video games video game articles and the people who play and read both i free free at last until januarybut taking a a day or two off also means filling this website with the almighty drip of prewritten content the wheels keep turning no matter the day of the year and as a lowly worker bee i am happy to oblige the game informer cms neverending need for listiclesso what should we rank this time really it could be anything we don put too much thought into these they pretty loweffort moderatetohigh gain pieces you just come up with a couple of good buzzwords something at least a few thousand people will click on throw a few hundred words at it and you got yourself a list typically you want to theme it around something timely to cash in on good seo or twitter trends something a lot of people are either looking for or talking abouti got it here are our top five video game characters that would get coal in their stockings this holiday seasoneveryone loves nathan drake he one of the most iconic heroes in sony evergrowing roster of triplea games that are mostly boring to play he handsome funny charismatic and if you never seen an indiana jones movie he seems like a totally unique and original characterbut underneath drake everyman veneer lies a deep dark secrethe is literally a mass murderer period point blank the whole thing about uncharted games is nathan drake and his merry band of idiots go to a different country kill several zip codes worth of people then steal local ancient artifacts in a medium filled to the brim with reprehensible behavior drake really is a special case herean easy argument in drake favor would be that he never kills good or innocent people or at least not intentionally i guess if you doing mental gymnastics at an olympic level killing thousands of people over the course of one short decade is fine so long as they badwhat that doesn excuse is the plundering of a nation historical artifacts this is utterly appalling and drake should be tried by the united nations for his crimes against human history our knowledge of ancient civilizations art and technology has been set back untold decades by this guy trying to make a quick buck until naughty dog releases a dlc where drake returns these artifacts to their rightful countries then i refuse to take that studio seriously as a video game storyteller i sorry i know that harsh but as the series stands now i can not overlook this irresponsible narrativenathan drake is a terrible person you can quote me on that put coal in that man stockingpostscript did you play uncharted drake also a terrible husband good godhe also a mass murdererthey all mass murderers i don want to get political here but i don think mass murderers are on santa nice list sorry but that just how i was raisednow look i am not espousing the idea that video games cause realworld violence that a harmful idea regurgitated ad nauseam by rightwing pundits that both ignores actual research and is reductive to video games as an art form nor am i saying video games are too violent i love violence you can quote me on thatwhat i saying is when we considering this list and believe me a lot of consideration has gone into it since i started writing it seven minutes ago if we coming down on characters like nathan drake and trevor phillips for their propensity for mass murder then we must hold all other similar video game characters accountable as well if we want video games to be taken seriously as a medium then we must be willing to criticize the art form we love hold it to higher standards and expect better from itthis is why i am here to say of all characters in modern triplea games are getting coal in their stockings this year during the holidays too many bad boys out there on the shelves of your local gamestop being too willynilly with guns swords bombs and the such unfortunately for all of them santa is skipping their houses this yearfull disclosure game informer is owned by the gamestop corporation however our parent company had no insight into the rankings or evaluations present in this articleas my colleague jason guisao so elegantly puts itif you made it this far into this list then this one should come as no surprise of course the video game character santa is skipping the most this year is louse the mouse from funcom landmark game daze before christmasi know i preaching to the choir here everyone is always saying this but louse is such a little rat pun fully intended this little son of a gun had the audacity to tear through the world christmas presents casting a curse on all the gifts i swear if i could get my own hands on louse the mouse for what i would do you best believe there be coal in my stocking this year too it makes my blood boil just thinking about itlouse the mouse is a menace to society and a threat to the holidays and therefore he earns the top spot on our list of video game characters most likely to get coal in their stockingswas our list correct it was no need to leave

Character,customization has become a bigger and bigger part of allowing players to express themselves in online multiplayer matches for call of duty modern warfare infinity ward wants to not only allow players to change the way their characters look but also how they play we sat down with several key members of the team to discuss all the ways players can make the call of duty modern warfare multiplayer experience their ownplayers can customize their characters on three main levels looks loadouts and guns as you play you unlock new operators to choose from new skins to equip them with and new attachments to snap onto your gun when many people think of deep customization systems they look at the purely cosmetic ways you can make your character look cool however with modern warfare the cosmetic side of multiplayer character customization is perhaps the shallowest when it comes to the options available to playersmodern warfare multiplayer consists of two factions allegiance and coalition when you first start playing multiplayer you only have access to generic soldiers on each side however as you play you unlock new operators for each faction from coalition grizzled inyourface texan known as dday to allegiance eerie man of few words krueger you likely to find a character to represent how you want to appear and sound in game despite the characters featuring wildly different looks and personalities don worry about being forced to play as a character whose personality you don like just because you like how they control the operators only differ from one another cosmeticallythis is pure player visual choice studio art director joel emslie says if people want to represent themselves visually in the game thats what this does i think thats important because when you tie gameplay to visuals what if i dont like a specific character but i love that ability im stuck with that voice and that look just because i like to play that way thats something we really wanted to acknowledge and make sure the two were nicely put together in a way where people could really have the ability to make those decisions for themselveswhile you can customize any of the characters looks down to individual parts each character has unlockable skins we went with a system that is more of an overall skin multiplayer design director geoff smith says we didnt want to deal with knee pads and the noodly bits wed rather do highly authored looks on those characters rather than having to deal with will those socks go with those gloves and trying to make yourself matchwhen i was able to dig into the character customization each operator had eight slots for unlockable skins but emslie tells me that number isn final we might have more or we might have less he says for me i dont want to ever see a skin or an incarnation of a character thats just arbitrary to fill a number our focus has been whatever customization we put in has to be completely high quality you dont just put it there to put a number downinstead of letting you customize every nitty gritty detail of how your character looks infinity ward wants you to have a field day with customizing your weaponry the gunsmith feature returns giving you full control over how your gun looks and acts in my time messing around with the gunsmith between matches every attachment had some kind of give and take adding a suppressor might make you harder to hear coming but it might affect the speed of your ads to combat that you may want to try adding a lighter stock to improve your handlingit really speaks to early on recognizing that the gun is really the main character smith says customizing the guy is great and thats fun and you pick whoever you just kind of align with but we really wanted to have that mmo character with the gun thats why we invested early on with all those noodly bits because thats your tool to interact with our worldonce you figure out the perfect combination of attachments for your favorite gun you can save and even name the gun i think everybody wants to use excalibur rather than broadsword smith says so once you name it it becomes a thing and kind of a talking point we see it in the office i made this combination heres the recipe and its really cool give it a try it just becomes a cool talking point of what kind of frankenstein experiment you came up withit might sound like players will be findingoverpowered combinations but infinity ward isn particularly concerned about that as long as there areways to counter those setups a good goal for the system for us is that its not that we want to have a golden gun in there its that we want to have three or four multiplayer design director joe cecot saysof course it wouldn be a call of duty game without being able to customize your loadout while the gunsmith customizations are certainly a part of your loadout it goes well beyond that to allow players to cater to how they want to play similar to previous years players can choose a primary weapon secondary weapon three perks a lethal grenade a tactical grenade and a field upgradein addition killstreaks return meaning you can choose from a list of effective rewards for strong performance are you the kind of player to rack up long killing sprees you can gamble and put all your points in the higher end of the killstreak spectrum however maybe you the kind of player who gets two or three kills at most before you die in that case you want to stick to the lower end of the rewards to try and wring out every last kill you can get from enemyspotting uavs to airstrikes to even seemingly unstoppable juggernaut suits the killstreak rewards are just one additional way you can cater to your playstylecall of duty modern warfare impresses with its level of customization particularly with regards to how granular the modifications are for the weapons themselves however if you concerned that it be a race to unlock the best weapons infinity ward says you shouldn worry our default classes will be some of the best stuff in the whole game smith says you put those up front and if those are solid enough to play in some leagueplay finals then we know were doing our job well then when i buy the game six months later im not at a disadvantage because i have all the best stuff right here then youre just chasing your agency out of iti excited to see what kinds of experimental monsters players can come up with when the game launches on xbox one and pc october to see the customization in action check out our episode of new gameplay today belowto learn

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/11/18/going-from-assassins-creed-to-immortals-fenyx-rising,Going From Assassin's Creed To Immortals Fenyx Rising,when you rattle off the biggest and most wellknown franchises in the video game industry you don have to go far down the list to find assassin creed since its debut in the serieshas spawned more than video games a theatrical film starring michael fassbender an upcoming liveaction netflix series and several comics and novels as the studio behind two of the wellreceived recent games syndicate and odyssey ubisoft quebec was ready to spread its wings and fly with new ipwhile the team at ubisoft quebec is excited about the opportunity to start fresh it was actually a glitch that occurred during assassin creed odyssey development that was the first kernelof inspiration for what would become immortals fenyx rising there was a bug at the time where youd be sailing on your trireme and instead of having a normal human crew youd have a crew of cyclopsgame director scott phillips says we knew that was wrong for odyssey but it also sparked this idea of actually it would be quite cool if we can break those historical bonds and just go full force into mythologythe fate of atlantis expansion allowedodyssey protagonist to travelto the world of the greek gods butubisoft quebec hungered for a deeper dive into mythology the teamwanted to create a unique experience free from the chains of a wellestablished franchise we were using the greek mythology but within the limit of the brand and the mythology of the brand more than the greek mythologyassociate game director julien galloudec says for immortals fenyx rising it was the other way around we wanted to embrace the greek mythologythe team used the knowledge and experience it gained from creating massive openworld games like syndicate and odyssey and carried it into development of immortals fenyx rising while many of the lessons transferred from the assassin creed franchise to the development of immortals the team wanted to stretch into new directions with elements like comedy and puzzles taking a step out of the periphery and into the spotlightwhat we learned from odyssey was that we really enjoyed making funny lighthearted types of stories in gamescinematic team lead michelle plourde says we took what we learned from odyssey and where that kind of shined through and we transferred that into fenyx rising but instead of making that where you see instances of the story being funny at some points we tried to make it so its a comedy instead of this type of serious gamewhile assassin creed wasa major and unavoidable influence forimmortals perhaps just as big of a comparison can be drawn to the legend of zelda breath of the wild due to immortals fenyx rising approach to exploration traversal and puzzle design when we started the game especially for the puzzles we looked at many games and obviously we looked at breath of the wild because the structure was very close to what we wantedgalloudec says that was interesting for the structure and the way to build a level but we also looked at the portals world of goo angry birds we looked at many many different games to see not necessarily the gameplay but more how they use ingredients how they use the level design and the flow to build that level where the player is going to quickly understand what theyre supposed to do while still having to think about the execution of the solutionthough the team pulled froma large number of inspirations there was some resistance to them including puzzles as a central mechanic it was something we had to be very clear with when we were talking with ubisofts headquarters in paris about we want to approach puzzles as one of our core pillars and there was a bit of a are you sure phillips recalls we didnt necessarily have a lot of experience we had some people that had done prince of persia we had tiny little elements in assassins creed odyssey but it was really a whole new thing for us so we spent a lot of time iterating and prototyping and trying a lot of different things theres or so vaults in the game but we had over prototypes and we tried a lot of different variety of things we iterated on them a ton to find what are the right mechanics and the right ways to challenge the playerswhile the focus is currently on making immortals fenyx rising debut as strong as possible the team isn ruling out expanding it into additional mythologies in the future much like the assassin creed franchise has however before that happens this game has to do well firstcoming from our pedigree on assassins creed we had the thought process of what is the universe phillipssays i think imagining visiting different mythologies in a way that is similar to assassins creed could makea lot of sense well see how immortals fenyx rising does and then well go from thereimmortals fenyx rising is set to launch on playstation xbox series

to talk to more than a dozen people who had a hand in the history of double fine productions this article originally ran ingame informer issue but we republishing it on our website inanticipation of psychonauts upcoming august release to see more of our exclusive coverage make sure to check out our rapidfire interview with double fine founder tim schafer a new psychonauts level and our inside look at how the game is handling conversations around mental healthtim schafer was on a glacier somewhere in nepal thinking he was going to die when he decided to quit his job and found his own companynot too long before some friends he doesnt say who suggested they all leave their positions at lucasarts the game division of lucasfilm to start a new company but schafer who doesnt like worrying about buying printer paper and toilet paper says he was hesitant to take them up on the offeri just want to make the games i dont want to worry about the building and all that stuff he says laughingthree weeks in nepal later after a grueling journey as he puts it schafer started to change his mind something on that trip i was like i think when i get back im going to quit and im going to start my own company he says it was also maybe because i was sick and i lost pounds on that trip and i was just marching all day longthere was also the fear of death a quick help in the decisionmaking of any personi thought i was gonna die on this glacier because we took this pass youre not supposed to take in the winter and it was snowing schafer recalls were on this glacier that had these sinkholes in it it was like i guess were gonna die up here but we made it and then i was like okay im going to start my own companywhether or not the story is embellished years later its a fitting origin for the company schafer founded double fine productions which has had its fair share of close calls with closure over its twodecade history but its also become a mainstay in the game industry consistently putting out cult classics such as the original psychonauts brtal legend broken age and nearly two dozen other games while double fine has never released a quoteunquote blockbuster quite the opposite in a lot of cases its made a name for itself creating quirky inventive and offbeat titles and it did all that while remaining independent that is until when microsoft purchased the companyto tell the storied history of double fine we talked to over a dozen people from the company including schafer himself the people who have been with the studio since its inception and the newer employees this is the oftenrocky story of double fine as told by those who were thereed note to avoid confusion with other articles all job titles reflect peoples current positions on psychonauts numerous ways the creation of psychonauts the first game double fine developed and released was hazardous to the developers livesdouble fine didnt begin in an office but rather a garage made into an office in the soma district of san francisco calif in after a fourmonth stint in a haunted clog shop it wasnt great rats filled the space it was below sea level so when it rained excessively the sewer would overrun overflowing the toilets while working in a garage provided employees with parking according to people that worked there it also meant constantly breathing in carbon monoxideyou would drive into the office and like pull up right next to somebodys desk and turn your car off says nathan bagel stapley a senior concept artist for double finethere was no heat either says senior animator ray crook and so in the wintertime we would just hang up big sheets of plastic and had these little space heaters that would blow the circuits if you had more than like three of them goingthe neighborhood at the time wasnt always safe either writing in a postmortem for gamasutra caroline esmurdoc psychonauts executive producer described the office as what started as punkrock charm soon became depressing disgusting and dangerousone night a woman from the transient hotel next door jumped out a fifth floor window and landed on our roof breaking her leg and knocking a hole in our ceiling esmurdoc wrote another day there was a dead body in the doorway across the street apparently the victim of an overdosethey werent ideal or perhaps even always legal working conditions but with the bad is also the good talking to developers that were there at the time theres an almost garageband quality to the early days of double fine they threw parties in the office decorated the walls with interesting art and overall enjoyed the company of their coworkers for a little while schafer even made and painted every employees desk that seemed like a cool startup thing to do he sayspredictably the interview process at double fine was also atypical lead programmer kee chi says that when he interviewed with the company he talked about zelda for an hour rather than answering any technical programming questions instead of going through the process of talking to recruiters and human resources levi ryken now a senior artist with double fine had to speak to every single person at the company to get hired as an internobviously these things are all nicer to think about from a distance chi says and now that we have functioning toilets we can look at it like ah remember the time when things were like that but its also a time when all of us got to know each other and parts of the game came together there was a lot of diy feeling at the old office that the new offices dont quite have but it also could either be just fond memories of different times or the carbon monoxide poisoning we got at the time its one of those thingscoincidentally psychonauts was initially being developed for microsoft which was getting ready to release the original xbox around the same time as double fines founding while pitching the game schafer gave a talk at the annual game developers conference about character design it caught the ear of ed fries then vice president of game publishing at microsoft who signed the game at the time microsoft handed out ping pong balls with the xbox logo on it which fries gave schafer when they first met two decades later schafer says he had the ball sitting on his desk when he signed the paperwork for microsofts acquisition of double fine in i had it on a table in a little stand like a little ceremonial thing to bring the whole thing full circle he saysinspired by the teams love of games such as rayman and super mario psychonauts is a platformer telling the story of razputin raz aquato a psychic in attendance at whispering rock psychic summer camp raz goes into the minds of various people confronting their problems and helping them work through their issues psychonauts was also made to harken back to the teams memories of summer camp being kids exploring the woods and stumbling upon unexpected discoverieswe had those childhoods schafer says back when youre like freerange kids where youd just wander into really dangerous locations and explore a lot of those memories got into the first gamebut psychonauts development was brutal and the developers we talked to quickly brought up how hard the company crunched while making the game there were a few reasons why for one schafer who wrote and directed the game had spent the last decade making pointandclick adventure games at lucasarts he had no experience with platformers neither did numerous members of the team compounding issues this was at a time when developers typically made their own engines inhouse from scratch and this was all on top of the fact that double fine was a new studio and it had to grow staff up and learn how to be a real company it had to invent all its development pipelines and processes there was a lot to be done forcing the team to crunch continuouslyback then you guys were rolling your own engine with a small studio on a new ip with a brandnew team in a fing automotive garage says principal artist lee petty so yeah thats gonna be hardall processes that you would think a more mature studio would have then we were just all figuring it out chi says but i also think this naive optimism that we had in making the game also made it so that we could make the crazy game that we did in psychonauts even though it came with a lot of growing pains because we made it in the way that we didpsychonauts was in development for around five years in that time double fine learned how to operate as a team and make the game it wanted to make but it came with some high costs there was of course the crunch it was terrible crook says but also microsoft was going through its own internal changes in january fries left the company around the same time microsoft was beginning its transition to the xbox in preparation for its november release this halted funding for original xbox games planned to launch after expensive and behind schedule new management within microsoft opted to cancel psychonauts even though by this point double fine felt it was finally making real progressin february at what seemed to be our peak productivity a time when we felt most confident about shipping on schedule microsoft decided to discontinue its development of psychonauts esmurdoc wrote in her postmortem microsoft had funded years of mistakes course corrections and learning curves but it drew the line at underwriting the remaining game development now that double fine was finally on track when ed fries departed microsoft the new management seemed to think that we were expensive and late the assessment was accurate though it did not reflect the progress we were finally making toward shipping the game and recovering the development was a rough year for double fine one it nearly didnt survive in multiple past interviews schafer has even admitted to telling his team double fine was shutting down and that the next paycheck would be the final one luckily however a loan from simcity creator will wright was able to keep the company afloat before a latestage deal with majesco saved both the project and the studio but despite all the hard work double fine put into getting it made when psychonauts came out it was a commercial failure it got great reviews but no one was buying it psychonauts sold less than copies in was one of those situations where if wed known like most games if you really knew how hard they were going to be by the time they were done you probably wouldnt have started any of them schafer jokesbut the lessons double fine learned on that first game would continue to shape the company for years to come even if its following projects were far cries from summer campin preparation for its next project double fine went back to the drawing board from the ground up it rethought how it approached development and crunchdouble fines next game brtal legend released in october was incredibly ambitious for its time part actionadventure part realtime strategy game with multiplayer sprinkled on top the game tells the story of heavy metal roadie eddie riggs voiced by actor jack black as he tries to save humanity this time around ea signed on as publisher a deal schafer describes as getting enough money to finish the project correctly while avoiding a big crunchpeople say well thats just an inevitable part of games but its not schafer says after psychonauts we all just got a bunch of books on production methods and a software development technique called scrum all these things we had never done before like how do we plan better how do we do better software planningeven though it was a really long development like psychoanuts i think it was four years or five years says senior designer gabe cinquepalmi definitely much better hours for most people on the second game not having done the first one just hearing the storiesbrtal legend received positive reviews and to this day is still double fines bestselling game but whats a big hit for double fine and whats a big hit for ea are different scales schafer says for ea brtal was not a financial success selling just over copies in its first month in a interview with gamasutra schafer said the game had gone on to sell million copies over time regardless it didnt stop double fine from beginning work on a sequel but again ea thought otherwise canceling brtal despite the fact double fine had invested most of its resources to the projectthe brtal cancellation was gnarly because we didnt get paid for like a month stapley sayswasnt that psychonauts crook asksthat was both producer malena annable repliesup to this point double fine was a onegame studio so losing any project was a major blow the studios previous games hadnt made enough money that it could afford to coast when brtal was canceled double fine was essentially on borrowed time the studio had to pivot its plans fasttwice during brtals development once in the middle and once at the end the team stopped working to participate in what double fine calls amnesia fortnight for two weeks the studio breaks into smaller teams tasked with developing a small game under a short time span its meant to be a palate cleanser an internal break that gives the team some time to think about and focus on something other than the game it needs to ship however with brtal canceled and double fine at risk of closure again the projects developed during this twoweek game jam became the studios lifelinefour games two from the first amnesia fortnight two from the second were selected to pitch to potential publishers this included stacking thq costume quest thq iron brigade microsoft and sesame street once upon a monster warner bros four games schafer says that probably wouldnt have been made if fate hadnt forced the studios hand but also by circumstance four games that now needed to be made quicklywe got back from thanksgiving break and tims like by the way they canceled brtal legend and we need to get some more money petty who directed stacking recalls so how would you feel about pitching stacking starting next weekeffectively this turned double fine into a multiproject studio it no longer had all its eggs in one basket it also gave employees at double fine other than schafer the chance to direct their own games pitch projects to publishers and lead teams its an approach double fine has continued often releasing multiple projects per yearit takes away some of that betting the farm feeling that you have when youre a single company making a single game schafer says its like is heavy metal worth risking the whole companymore than years later smaller projects now make up the bulk of double fines catalog this move not only saved the company after brtal cancellation but it became the studios primary development and financial model creating a diverse portfolio full of genres publishers and art styles it wouldnt be the last time double fine experimented with how it funded projectsin double fine launched its first crowdfunding campaign using the site kickstarter asking for the lowest budget the company would have ever worked with to make a small adventure game and to film the process with documentary crew player productions the campaign raised making it the mostfunded kickstarter campaign up to that point what began as a small project transformed into a much larger pointandclick adventure game called broken age a wellreviewed game but one that took three years to develop and had to be split into two episodes to secure more fundingthe trials tribulations and development of broken age have been chronicled in exhaustive detail a product of player following the entire multiyear process for the double fine adventure documentary but its still an important piece of double fines history on the one hand it proved there is still an audience for the types of games schafer made at lucasarts a fact that wasnt lost on double fine after broken age the studio acquired the rights to some of schafers old games such as grim fandango and full throttle remastering them for modern consoles that helped stabilize the studio financially as well petty saysit also moved double fine towards the level of transparency its now known for including broken age player has also documented numerous amnesia fortnights the development of the aforementioned remasters and produced a retrospective on the original psychonauts the crews still at double fine too filming the development of psychonauts everything at the studio is for show inadvertently its created a unique situation where potential employees can learn about double fine to a degree most people cant about possible future jobsit was a great way to see what type of people worked at double fine and double fines philosophies senior systems programmer aaron jacobs says having watched that it made it very clear that it would be a great place to work it just seemed like a really enjoyable place to be and so yeah when i then graduated college it was just like a nobrainer it made sense to come to join this place that just seemed like a fantastic place to work atwhile it is hard to have cameras constantly in the studio most staff we talked to say the double fine adventure documentary is like a yearbook or journal for broken age allowing team members to relive the experience on youtube at any time that said double fine offers all employees the option to optout of being featured in its documentariesive had a lot of team members being like i never wanna be that exposed again schafer admits about double fine adventure i had some people be like some programmers i just wanna work on tools from now on i dont wanna face the public anymore because its raw and it takes a tollthe development of broken age stands as an inflection point for double fine it provided the studio with a level of autonomy over what projects it works on bypassing the traditional publisher model going directly to fans it wouldnt be the only project double fine crowdfunded all of this would combine for double fines newest and biggest project yet psychonauts double fine is a known quantity while it still hasnt released a blockbuster per se the developer has been a consistent source of interesting and unique games throughout its two decades now years after its first employees breathed in carbon monoxide in a parking garage with no heat its catalog is full of cult classics and fan favorites double fine has a better safer office tooits also a great time of change for double fine in the studio announced psychonauts again it turned to fans this time through the crowdfundinginvestment site fig founded by double fines former coo justin bailey schafer also serves as an advisor for the company by the end of the campaign in january double fine raised over million for development while its also released numerous other games since such as headlander grim fandango remastered and rad and dipped its toe into publishing psychonauts is double fines largest projectperhaps too big at least for crowdfunding while its allowed the game to exist in a way that it might not have otherwise schafer admits that psychonauts now a fiveplus year project is too much for the model one year he says one years the max in starbreeze also invested million into the projects development acquiring rights to release the game digitally on consoles and pc though thats since been assigned to microsoftthis leads in many ways to double fines most recent and most significant change its no longer an independent studio in onstage at schafer revealed that microsoft had purchased double fine in the immediate term this move helps the production of psychonauts schafer told gamesindustrybiz in that before the purchase double fine had removed the games boss fights for budget reasons but was able to add them back in once microsoft got involvedin the long term it means double fine no longer must tour around pitching its games looking for funding from different partners trying to strike deals to stay alive being under the microsoft umbrella is a security blanket for double fine even if there are still unknowns and anxieties from people at the studiofor me it was just i was scared but i was also relieved crook says i had both those things because wed been through so much and so much of it was financial and then i was thinking about the burden that it would take off of tim and that felt good to me knowing what hes gone through and what a lot of us have gone through but then theres always youre scared right is this going to change everything is double fine what it is just going to be no more is it going to be differenti was very much like i dont want to be acquired schafer says but when they started talking about what they had learned from acquiring minecraft developer mojang how to honor what makes a company successful as you acquire it i felt like that was really true that they had figured out a different model for acquisition that is nondestructivecomparing the production of psychonauts to its sequel reveals apparent growth for double fine for one talking to newer members of the team crunch and labor expectations are far better than they were on the first game while its not perfect theres always room for improvement according to the people we talked to double fine makes a concerted effort to keep hours realistic and manageable the same can be said about amplifying the creativity of its employees just because someone works in one department doesnt mean they cant contribute ideas to anotheri think prioritizing people is something that double fine does a good job at says environment artist janice bell because it just feels like a lot of other studios see their people as assets where double fine is the first studio ive worked at where they actually see you as people important parts of the studio with views that matter and input that matterswhere double fine goes next remains to be seen its an interesting time for the company though as it might be one of the only times in years that its had some amount of solid financial security through ups and downs near misses and close calls double fine has made it through a lot of tumultuous times and somehow never abandoned what made the company special in the first place it might not be the last time double fine falls on hard times but at the very least it has stability nowi joked that double fine was really the one thing that we truly excelled at was circling the drain annable says about double fines future with microsoft so if this put a few more inches in the tub it was perfect for me,en,1189.0,Positive

whole seemed almost magicali was there at the beginning schafer says i remember my dad bringing home a magnavox odyssey the first home arcade console ever and just being so fascinated with it sometimes it feels funny to explain to people why its exciting to see things moving on a screen im trying to talk to my daughter about it shes grown up with smartphones and im like no you dont understand tv was controlled by other people and then you could make dots move on it it was so fascinatingschafer quickly became a video game fan he devoured text adventures such as zork the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy and scott adams savage island series after his dad brought home a few atari consoles as well as an atari computer schafer began experimenting with designing his own games but he didnt initially think about pursuing a job in the video game industry in college schafer studied computer science however he was most passionate about creative writing authors like kurt vonnegut slaughterhousefive breakfast of champions were his icons and he dreamed of being a writeri thought i would write short stories and get a job at a database programming company schafer says all the jobs back then were database programmers i loved video games but in my head they were made by companies i would think of atari as oh its this big monolithic building full of scientists and robots and some big massive brain but i realized later woah they were just young kids they were young programmers all by themselves making these gameskurt vonnegut his thing was that he wrote short stories when he was starting out working at ge so early on i was like okay ill get that database programming job and at night ill write short stories i still have never really except for one story in college i dont think ive ever really finished a short story outside of that i was like okay ill work on this games job for a while until i become a famous writer like kurt vonnegut a couple years into it i was like hey im getting paid to write this is a writing job im getting paid and im writing dialogue and i actually am a professional writer it took me a long time to accept that i was working as a writerone day a friend told schafer that lucasfilm games rebranded to lucasarts in was looking for developers who could program and write schafer felt that he had unknowingly been preparing for a dream job his entire life he thought back to the days he spent playing lucasarts games on his atari and he knew he didnt want to pass up this opportunity he just had to nail the interviewi had a bad phone interview with david fox the designer and programmer behind rescue on fractalus and zak mckracken and the alien mindbenders schafer says he was really nice but he asked me what lucasfilm games i had played and i told him i really liked the games i had played on my atari like ballblaster he was like ballblaster huh thats what ballblazer was called when it was pirated laughs i was like oh god he got me there because i had a disc of all their pirated games piracys bad kids dont do it youll end up like me and have your own company and stuffwhile schafer was convinced hed blown the initial interview he wasnt deterred and spent several nights crafting a perfect cover letterresume in a cheeky nod to the job he hoped to one day attain schafer designed his letter to look like an graphical adventure game complete with ascii art depicting the lucasfilm campus interview be damned schafer got the jobwe got to meet renowned warner bros animation director chuck jones because he was a big inspiration on the style of day of the tentacle we met with him because i think we were hoping he would say a blurb for the box like some endorsement but we never came out and asked him for it so he never did laughs it was marketings idea we were just so excited about meeting him we forgot to ask but he liked the game it was nice that chuck jones liked it if youve ever seen the animated cartoon short duck amuck i feel like duck amuck has influenced every game ive ever made its bugs bunny torturing daffy duck with his pen and his eraser and drawing anvils to drop on his head warner bros cartoons and growing up with surrealism i think affected a whole generation of creators playing with your perception is something we do in psychonauts all the time its basic roadrunner logicafter the success of star wars george lucas built skywalker ranch near nicasio calif to function as his personal movie development workshop the grounds contained an animal barn outdoor swimming pool fitness center vineyard and gardens full of fruits and vegetables for the onsite gourmet restaurant to use when schafer joined lucasfilm in the campus also housed a motion picture mixing facility and served as the corporate offices for the studios many accountants and lawyersit was amazing schafer says i mean right out of college to go to work at skywalker ranch you know this was before episode was even imagined so this was star wars in the magic times there were a lot of celebrities around skywalker ranch jack nicholson stopped by pearl jam would record records there at one point michael jackson was at the fourth of july picnic you had to get used to like dont go up to people dont bother them be cool around celebritieslucasfilms computer and game division was tucked into the back of the ranchs facilities but schafer still found it to be a nearidyllic workspace over coffee breaks he could walk out on the balcony and watch deer graze in the field when he returned to his desk he and his cohorts would joke around and talk about their favorite computer games it had a really wellfunded startup kind of vibe and then at lunch youd walk down to the main house this beautiful victorian where there was gourmet food for a day schafer sayshowever schafers time at the ranch didnt last long as some of the higherups at lucasfilm eventually got fed up with the rowdy antics coming from the games team they kicked us out because games people do things that they dont like at the ranch like ordering pizza at midnight and being a little bit rowdier schafer says laughingschafer and the rest of the lucasarts team moved into the kerner complex in san rafael calif the building was also home to the movie special effects giant industrial light magic at the time ilm was working on films such as the hunt for red october back to the future part iii and total recall the practical effects for many of these films required a lot of model work and schafer remembers watching scale figures of world war ii bombers exploding outside his office windowsfun things would happen schafer says theyd be like hey anyone wanna be an extra it pays bucks youll be an extra in die hard we ran out there at at night to in the morning and just walked around this field with fake snow they filmed us walking in different directions and put potato flakes on our shouldersschafers time at lucasarts was unforgettable but it wasnt all fun and games he had been hired to complete some serious work work that also involved a lot of fun and games as it would turn out schafers creative output over the next several years would result in some of the most beloved adventure games of all timepeople often ask do you have any regrets and ive always said no because ive really gotten to make everything i wanted to make but looking back the thing i regret the most in my career is the crunch modes i participated in and encouraged when i was younger wed just be like oh were working day and night and its fun because were making monkey island or whatever monkey island was fun and we loved working on it so it didnt really occur to us to complain or be upset about working day and night and also i was young and i didnt have much of a life id be like okay i could either work all night or i could go home and watch mystery science theater and eat chinese food its not that big a loss you know when its just yourself you can throw yourself against the task as hard as you can like all day and all night im going to push this rock ahhh im going to give it my all and then as i got more into a role where i was managing and designing and there were other people doing the gameplay programming stuff now youre pushing on a soft person whos against the rock so you can squish them and kill them if you push too hardbefore schafer joined lucasarts george lucas had licensed the star wars video games to companies like atari this meant lucas own employees couldnt produce games connected to the companys massive blockbuster franchise theyre like you guys have to just make up stuff we cant do star wars schafer says it was this golden age of having access to a big chunk of georges money and just being told to make up stuff from scratchstar wars games may have been off the table but that suited schafer just fine he was more excited by the prospect of working on strange original ideas as soon as schafer started he met a brilliant young designer named ron gilbert who was already working on a pointandclick adventure game called mutiny on monkey island later retitled the secret of monkey island schafer joined the team spending days researching serious pirate lore and reading books like treasure island to get into the right headspace however when gilbert asked schafer to write dialogue for the game schafer hesitated instead he wrote a couple of jokes about a threeheaded monkey which got a laugh out of fellow game designer dave grossmani was like later ron will come up and hell write the real dialogue which will be serious pirate lore schafer says and then ron came up and he played it hes like oh thats funny i was like ill put something serious in there later and he goes no thats the dialogue thats the dialogue for the game i was like youre gonna leave the threeheaded monkey line in there he goes yeah and you know what we should get lucasarts artist steve purcell to draw a threeheaded monkey and put it back there i was like are you kidding i was terrified that this raw silly joke was going in therei still had that image in my head of the big building full of scientists and robots that made games like some super smart brain that knows what theyre doing and then you get in it and you realize everyones just like you people are smarter than you for sure but not like a different species of smart so yeah i didnt think the game would be super serious but i thought it would be i dont know i thought some adult was going to come along and write the real dialoguelater when the team was designing combat for monkey island schafer felt like they hit a wall early concepts were based on jordan mechners fighting game karateka and featured high low and medium attacks that players could counter using high low and medium blocks the team even spent time watching several classic errol flynn films for inspiration however the group never felt like the swordfighting mechanics were a good fit for their adventure game gilbert eventually had the revelation that the dueling mechanic should be based on a war of words where players chose snappy comebacks and insults as a way of attacking their opponentive always loved heavy metal wed talk in high school about whats the difference between hard rock and heavy metal we were like well heavy metal is about madness loneliness darkness and insanity and hard rock is about partying and sex thats the big difference i think about that why was i so drawn to the themes in heavy metal which are always really dark everything by black sabbath all of bassist and lyricist geezer butlers lyrics are mostly about the fear of going insane and thats had an influencei was like you cant people want to swordfight theyre gonna be so mad schafer says i was so scared by this crazy idea and then of course it turned out to be that the insult sword fighting is some peoples favorite part of monkey island and its this classic thing that was another example of just how afraid you are sometimes of ideas that dont fit learning to run with them was an important lessonafter working on the secret of monkey island and monkey island lechucks revenge schafer moved into the role of codirector alongside dave grossman the two created day of the tentacle a bizarre adventure game about a group of young friends and their timetraveling adventure to stop a sentient disembodied tentacle from taking over the worldi used to talk about day of the tentacle as being the last fun game to work on schafer says i always liked the games after but that was the last time it felt easy because we didnt have and we didnt do voice the brainstorming sessions were so fun because wed just spend all afternoon in a room eating candy and telling jokes and accidentally designing a couple puzzles a day those were really funschafer became the lone director on his next project full throttle lucasarts hoped full throttle would revolutionize the adventure game genre and schafer had the freedom to craft a more serious story about nearfuture biker gangs and corporate espionage schafer and his team moved into the offices that once housed pixar and got to work modernizing their traditionally convoluted mechanics into a streamlined pointandclick interface at one point schafer designed an interactive sequence where full throttles protagonist underwent a peyoteinduced hallucination this sequence was cut from the game but some of its concepts eventually took shape in the psychonauts seriesaround this time schafer also continued to refine his writing style and prove himself as more than just a humorist where the secret of monkey island and day of the tentacle were offthewall cartoons games like full throttle featured unique detailed worlds full of compelling characters schafer began to understand that he could tell funny stories that still had heart and said something meaningful of course as any artist will tell you creating anything of value is hardthere are lot of writers that have shot themselves i think i know why schafer says and thats probably something i should learn to deal with better because writing can be really isolating when you do something creative its one thing to just output your own creative ideas but to be able to explain them why youre doing it im not even clear why im doing half the stuff im doing its hard to sit in a room and be like i think the reason im making this joke here is that threeheaded monkeys are funny and what if someone was like i think it should be a fourheaded monkey being able to have that conversation is a skill that people have to learnafter full throttle schafer worked on a film noirinspired adventure called grim fandango which followed a travel agent for the dead named manny calavera on a multiyear journey across the underworld like full throttle schafer hoped to expand the definition of an adventure game grim fandango combined aztec beliefs of the afterlife with a art deco aesthetic to produce an incredibly striking visual style the games environments were built using a mix of prerendered backgrounds and character models which allowed the team to design new kinds of puzzles that encouraged players to explore the world when grim fandango launched in october it received rave reviews and a few game of the year nods schafer didnt know it at the time but it would be his last project with lucasartsin the the rights to star wars games had reverted to lucasarts and by the turn of the millennium the company was ramping up production on a series of games to support the release of the star wars prequel films schafer watched the tide at lucasfilm turn from supporting original ideas to focusing on expanding a singular sciencefantasy universe while full throttle and grim fandango had been critical darlings their market value couldnt compete with one of the biggest media franchises on the planetsome people in management really didnt like the adventure games because they were not huge moneymakers schafer says especially once they started making star wars games they were like hey tim after grim why dont you just make a game that was their code for some sort of actiony kind of game and i kind of wanted to too yeah sure ill make a console game ill take all of the things we know from adventure games the dialogue and story and characters and stuff but itll just be easier to use and interact withthroughout the schafer played super mario final fantasy vii and the original tomb raider games those experiences awakened an excitement in him to explore fullyrealized worlds inspired by those titles he began work on a spythemed game that was a mix of stanley kubricks a space odyssey the spy thriller three days of the condor and the hong kong wirefu movies of jet li schafer continued to play with the idea of letting players travel deeper into their minds to meditate on objects to progress the story circling concepts that would finally see the light of day in psychonauts years laterhowever after a year of prototyping this spaceage spy game schafer felt like it was time to move on from the company that had given him a career he wanted more flexibility over his company culture and the freedom to pursue any project that sparked his imagination if hed stayed much longer at lucasarts he might have been asked to create a star wars or indiana jones game which could have been fun but he didnt feel like he had the appropriate skills to play in someone elses worldmaking up a world from scratch is one set of skills and working with someone elses world is a different set of skills before star wars episode i the phantom menace shipped licensing was like these characters cant have lightsabers theyre not jedi that team was like what we made all these characters have lightsabers they ended up having billy clubs or something at the last minute they had to turn off the lights on the lightsabers if i licensed psychonauts to someone else id be the same way id be like thats a psychic power you cant have magic the difference between psychic powers and magic is rah rah rah rah id be exactly the same way because when you make a world you want it to be consistentin the summer of schafer left lucasarts and founded double fine productions which has achieved its own measure of fame over the years still many fans look back with reverence at the work schafer produced during the first decade of his career titles like the secret of monkey island day of the tentacle and grim fandango are still considered some of the best adventure games of all time even so schafer recognizes that the most important thing he developed during his time at lucasarts wasnt an impressive gameography it was the formative experiences that shaped him into a designer who could lead a teamsomething i learned at lucas was that you dont really place your bets on ideas you place your bets on people schafer says its not the strength of the game idea that makes the game successful its the people who are going to push it make it work and change the ideathis article originally appeared in issue of game informer,en,1097.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/09/03/who-is-the-hunter-in-marvels-midnight-suns,Who Is The Hunter In Marvel's Midnight Suns?,marvel midnight suns brings together disparate members of the marvel universe into a supernatural adventure this quest to save the world features iron man captain america captain marvel wolverine blade doctor strange and ghost rider plus a few lesserknownheroes like magik and nico minoru however players see this iconriddled adventure through the eyes of the hunter an allnew hero designed by firaxis in collaboration with marvelworking with marvel to create a brand new hero was a dream come true for the firaxis games team but they needed to make sure the hunter could stand up next to the other iconic characters in the marvel universe there a specific way that marvel heroes become heroes and there a specific way that marvel villains become villains creative director jake solomon says you can just wave a wand and say cool the hunter exists now we had to think about what is the backstory why do they have meaning in this setting why would all these characters with all these powers recruit them to potentially lead them in this fight if we make them central it has to be authentic to this story and why the other heroes would look to the hunter as an equalfrom marvel perspective there had to be a good narrative reason for introducing this new hero everything of this experience revolves around the hunter and you playing as the hunter and the choices you make that is crucial to authentic marvel stories vice president of creative at marvel bill rosemann says every marvel story has to connect to the main protagonist you can take one hero out and put another hero in the story it shouldn work every story should be very personal to the hero in this story the hunter is at the center everything is connected all these characters all of the story is connected back to you the hunterthe hunter who can be male or female is the child of lilith the main antagonist that hydra awakens at the start of the game the mystical members of the midnight suns band together with iron man captain marvel and captain america but realize they still need help if they hope to stand a chance against lilith and her forces they learn about the hunter who defeated lilith centuries ago before laying to rest due to the hunter lineage as lilith child they the only ones powerful enough to stop the mother of demonsthe team of heroes travels to the abbey an old monastery that exists in a pocket dimension it the final havenfrom lilith reach there they use their combined magic to awaken the hunter and recruit them to their team if you saw the announcement trailer for marvel midnight suns above you saw a cutscene of the awakening ritual with the hunter back and caught up on what happening the team sets out to halt the dark prophecy once againunfortunately the hunter memory has not survived the centuries of hibernation so they don remember exactly how they once stopped lilith all they know is they must balance the light and dark energy within them and that their connection with lilith presents the danger of putting the hunter at odds with the rest of the team of heroes despite this innate caution shown by the rest of the heroes the team puts their trust in the hunter and sets out to give lilith and her forces all they gotthe hunter is the first customizable hero in the marvel universe players choose gender and skin tone then later equip different gear to complete the desired look not only that but players can also customize the move set and relationships of their hunter while in the abbey players can wander the halls and interact with the other heroes crashing in the mansion in any given day in the abbey you going to run into heroes who want to have a conversation maybe about something serious maybe not soloman says you going to have the ability to hang out with these heroes you going to have the ability to perform quests for these heroes hopefully the abbey feels like a living space like your dream of what a superhero headquarters can bejust as they must balance their light and dark energies the hunter can harness these opposing powers in combat dialogue and actions aroundthe abbey contribute to the hunter alignment you can shift your balance to be a light hunter dark hunter or somewhere in between the hunter is always a force of good but a dark hunter is more of an antihero while a light hunter is a more virtuous traditional hero these shifts are more than cosmetic as your alignment helps determine which abilities the hunter has access to dark abilities are generally for dealing damage at the cost of something like your health or your allies speed in contrast light abilities are generally more about buffing and healing your party letting you choose if you want your party leader to focus more on offense or defenseusing the unique battle system developed by firaxis players control the hunter and a party of other heroes to fight the forces of lilith including corrupted versions of iconic heroes and villains in my handson time the hunter displayed powerful abilities like grabbing enemies with a whip and slamming them into environmental objects or casting a heal to nearby allies iron man and captain marvel may be more familiar to the masses but based on my time with the game the hunter is a formidable combatant and a beyond valuable asset to the midnight sunsmarvel midnight suns launches on playstation xbox series xs playstation xbox one switch and pc in march

Become A Fan-Favorite Compilation,when halo the master chief collection was announced in fans were excited at the prospects of bringing forward the mainline halo series to the brand new xbox one with myriad enhancements and ways to engage with the multiplayer unfortunately the launch of the compilation which originally included halo combat evolved anniversary halo anniversary halo and halo featured several problems surrounding the multiplayer suite and the master chief collection seemed like it was well on its way to being one of the cautionary stories of unfulfilled potential within the games industrythe disappointing launch underwhelming feature set and broken matchmaking could have been the way we look back on halo the master chief collection in but developer industries wasn satisfied with releasing an unsatisfactory product meant to celebrate xbox flagship franchise we spoke with several key members of the master chief collection team to learn how industries righted the ship and elevated the compilation to one of the industry models for how to listen and act on player feedbackin halo the master chief collection was introduced as a way to not only celebrate the anniversary of the beloved halo but master chief saga as a whole to that point industries which was founded to takeover the halo franchise from bungie following bungie split from microsoft in currently working on halo guardians but a separate team within the studio began exploring ways to celebrate halo anniversary similar to how it did in with halo combat evolved anniversarythe basic ideaof halo anniversary which includesrevamped visuals and audio allnew cutscenes from renowned visual effects company blur studios and terminals that connectthe story to that of future games expanded on what the team did with its inaugural project with halo combat evolved anniversary even remade some fanfavorite maps from halo multiplayer from the ground up giving playersmodern highfidelity versionsin addition to all those elements industries wanted to reduce the friction players felt in halo combat evolved anniversary when going between the classic campaign and the multiplayer which was based on halo reach enginehowever the team began looking into what it could do to further celebrate the launch of the xbox one as well as master chief story to that pointthe team got really excited about thinking through kind of a bigger project which would encompass this larger story of all these games design director max szlagor says then it became a design challenge to think about if we look at a collection of halo titles how do we bring them together in a way that feels very seamless making it easy to jump in and move between the titles making sure the controls the user interface the networking the ability to move between games was all as seamless as possiblehalo the master chief collection emphasis was not to deliver a completely faithfulexperience of how halo combat evolved through halo played at the time of their respective releases instead industries looked into ways to improve the modern experience of playing these classic games we were trying to deliver the experience of these games as people remember them which isn necessarily onetoone with what the game is szlagor says it was an evaluation of do we rebuild this mode or this map what adjustments make sense in terms of the maps themselves because the maps received some changes the weapons the game modes just a variety of different things in terms of how do we provide that extra value extra options just more ways to really engage with that fill out that sandbox and make you feel goodthe mcc developers examined things like user interface matchmaking systems and more to see what pieces the disparate games all had in commonthe idea the team settled on was to have all the games connected with matchmaking designed to allow players to bounce between the various titles in the compilationnot only that but master chief collection unified control schemes and added leaderboards to the campaign as well as special features and achievements to give additional replay value to the campaigns many hadalready played through multiple timeshalo combat evolved anniversaryand halo anniversary were clearly the biggest leaps forward from the original versions but halo and also received boosts with framespersecond performance and cleaned up user interfaces while the two later games didn receive the visual and feature upgrades of halo combat evolved anniversary and halo anniversary szlagor doesn want to glance over how big of an undertaking the improvements of halo and were it a big deal for those games he says they were really optimized for the hardware at the time these games were launchedas the compilation approached its november launch industries was feeling confident about what it had created the team was excited for both new and old halo players alike to get their hands on the game and get caught up on master chief story prior to the impending release of halo guardians unfortunately the launch didn go as expected and the master chief collection quickly became synonymous with disastrous game launcheswhen halo the master chief collection launched it received strong critical praise across the board receiving a out of fromgame informerand high praise from most other outlets given access prior to launch unfortunately as the servers opened to the public and players tried to jump into the robust multiplayer package the cracks surrounding the game pvp suite presented themselves in obvious waysimmediately players complained about a wide range of issues largely centered on the game online modes these problems ranged from inaccurate ingame stats and uneven team compositions to players ranks being reset at random and matchmaking just outright not working on top of that players couldn join up with friends ingame chat was spotty at best and players were subjected to absurdly long load times the campaigns were largely solid but under the weight of the public trying to play the highly anticipated compilation halo the master chief collection competitive multiplayer crumbledas a result of the problems following the launch industries and xbox experienced backlash from both fans and critics halo the master chief collection gained longlasting infamy for how poor its launch was while players were shocked at the poor performance of the collection industries seemed equally as surprised that was not the sentiment that we had expected szlagor saysit was a learning experience for us in terms of a big project without the infrastructure to test online services at the scale that needed for something as big as thison launch day both the developer and xbox representatives recommended exiting and reentering matchmaking if it didn work within the first few minutes but despite the studio statement that it was actively working on a fix for the problem widespread issues would plague the compilation for many months the day after the master chief collection launched executive producer dan ayoub released an apology calling the complaints well deserved ayoub also told the community you deserve better before laying out a plan of serverside fixes to try and improve the state of the gamea game as large as halo the master chief collection has a massive surface area and while we made every effort to have the best launch possible for our fans issues surfaced with the launch and we committed to improving this as fast as possible and get you all into matches the november statement from ayoub readwe committed to improving things as fast as possible so you can have the halo experience you been waiting foras the problems persisted nearly two weeks after launch head of industries bonnie ross issued another apology largely echoing ayoub sentiments that the community deserved better and that the team will work to make it right with the fan base i personally apologize for this on behalf of us all at industries her statement on november read our team is working around the clock until these issues are resolvedthe problems persisted beyond the launch window in december industries and microsoft made the call to delay the windowsexclusive halo spartan strike in order to focus on fixing the game matchmaking later that month industries laid out a roadmap for how it planned to make it up to playersthat really was a good point for us to look at things like building the halo insider program and pivoting our communication to be more transparent szlagor says having this greater dialogue and honesty with our communitywith community faith at an alltime low industries needed to regain player trust and work to make halo the master chief collection not only the product the company originally envisioned but improve upon every facet to create the compilationfans deservedat launch master chief collection featured halo combat evolved anniversary halo anniversary halo and halo complete with all the multiplayer maps and extra features however once the state of the game was apparent industries began looking into ways to make it up to players as windeddown industries released a blog post detailing the first steps of rectification the company announced every master chief collection player would receive a free month of xbox live gold an exclusive ingame nameplate and an exclusive ingame avatar not only that but industries added an extra remakeof a halo map plus the campaign of halo odst to the master chief collection at no additional costin march industries released perhaps the most significant patch to date to master chief collection matchmaking and party systems however with the collection nearing six months since its launch many players and critics began wondering if the project was beyond saving the development team was not giving up though with both industries and xbox doubling down that fixing the compilation remained a top prioritygoing into the launch our internal processes and testing methodologies had told us that we had a game that was ready to launch head of xbox phil spencer toldgame informerat game developers conference then when it launched we learned some things we didn know going into the launch which is something we need to get better at you can simulate the realworld environment inside of any sterile fixed environmentto remedy this problem the development team continued implementing deeper and more solidlines of communication with active and enthusiastic members of the community reaching out to our communities is super important in engaging with themlead producer michael fahrny says if we had onesecret sauceto our success for mcc over the last few years it a group we have that we call reclaimers they members of the community think of them as ambassadors we give them access to a lot of the ideas builds features content all that stuff that we doing for mcc and we get raw feedback from them they help us gauge the temperature of where our readiness is and how the community is going to react to thingsin the time since master chief collection launch industries and the game development scene as a whole has become much more reliant on the gaming community to ensure it has remained in touch with the wants and needs of the most passionate fans community managers developers who are embedded in the various communitiesare nowessential members of most game studiosto deepen that connection with its community implemented a flighting program where the developers could interact with halo insiders to ensure the game is reaching certain goalsamong many checkpoints the team engages with through this flighting program matchmaking time is one area where the developers check in to make sure the times are satisfactory and only take within or secondsflighting is like a backbone to us producer sean swidersky says we will flight everything we can if we have time to do so it an essential part of our development processthe studio worked tirelessly to improve the experience and ensure that the master chief collection became the product fans wanted after several patches and serverside updates players began seeing marked improvements in the performance the fixesto matchmaking and the overall multiplayer experience continued rolling out and as the product stabilized in the year following launch industries once again returned to focusing on content the halo odst campaign was released to the master chief collection in and in halo reach joined the compilation alongside seasonal content as a result of fan feedbackwe always thinking about what the collection includes and certainly that a great question mark what else can we add szlagor says initially there a good story to tell in terms of the master chief collection with the master chief story i think there was a question of thematically does it make sense to include odst and reach certainly from a fan perspective all the halos is better than not all the halos there was definitely some discussion around that and it wasjust a matter of what could we do in what time frame and what makes sense for the themepart of the reason new content and upgrades continue to join the master chief collection is that the team is full of people who had an appreciation and love of the halo franchise before their job was to work on it in addition to longtime developers industries includes people who worked on halo mods or were active in the halo esports scene the result is a constant stream of passion projects from individual members of the development team many of which make it into the living product of mccwe constantly surprising ourselves with some of the ideas we come up with and then we sit down and talk about it and figure out if it makes sense to put it out to retail mcc fahrny says more often than not we end up doing it because as halo fans we think it going to be cool and then we start the whole process and go through flighting and everybody really loves it we end up doing all these things that how the new firefight options that came out with season came to fruitionthough halo guardians will no longer be the flagship halo title when infinite launches in earnest on december says there are currently no plans to add it into the master chief collection while much of the mcc updates and seasonal content is coming to a close in the near future industries has proven that sticking with a game even one that launches in a bad state can prove worth itthe thing i proud of is how committed the team is to solving this problem that commitment to delivering what our customers want is great spencer toldgame informerin that interview now anybody can throw a rock at me and say we shouldn have been in this situation in the first place and that fair enough but nobody thrown up their arms and run away from it the team has doubled downwith the master chief collection now one of the goldstandard redemption stories in the games industry industries has continued supporting the compilation even expanding to new platforms in addition to receiving enhancements on xbox series xs when those new systems launched in industries made the bold leap to pcfor the master chief collection team bringing the product to pc was an important step in the project postlaunch lifecycle but before theycommitted to doing it theywanted to make sure theycould do it rightfor us as a studio pc was never a first priority but what does it mean to actually be a modern pc game can we even bring the master chief collection all the games in the collection up to that standard fahrny says we sat down and did a lot of evaluations of competitive products good and bad things that competitors have done and we built a plan around it and then evaluated it we said think we can do this and we think we can do a really good job at it on top of that let go back and learn from these past mistakesthis time industries was much more methodicalabout how it approached bringing the collection to this new platform rolling the games out one by one rather than all at once over the course of a year starting in december and ending in november pc players gained access to each of the six titles in the current version of halo the master chief collection the rolledout approach allowed industries to learn its lessons one title at a time rather than all at once then when it wanted to address a problem it was more manageable and able to be implemented at launch for subsequent titles for example reach high refreshrate interpolation didn reach the standards the development studio hoped for so it improved it within reach then made sure the five remaining games hit the mark the team desiredwith the transparency the team acquired from its rough early days launching the xbox one version as well as the preexisting lines of communication with the community the pc version was a success it showed just how much the team has changed its approach to ensuring a game is ready for launch and listening to the community to improve the title in the following years the team even introduced crossplatform play in a huge leap forward when you consider how many troubles the game initially had only executing singleplatform multiplayer and mod support to the pc version this past summer to this day halo the master chief collection continues to receive updates across all doesn plan on stopping support for halo the master chief collection but the eighth season which started in october is the final season of content for the longrunning compilation going forward in order to avoid providing seasonal updates for both master chief collection and infinite simultaneously will continue to deliver new features and fixes in mcc but it will do so through smaller patches instead of large seasonsized updatesat a high level the mcc support is changing it not ending senior producer matt hohl says we still got mod tools to deliver we still got more games with custom game browserto deliver we still viewing ourselves as the stewards of these classic games we looking forward to the complementary relationship of infinite and mcc next yearas industries turns its focus towards halo infinite you can see that the lessons the studio learned from the early stumbles and later success of halo the master chief collection paiddividends in addition to listening to community feedback and delaying infinite a full year even if it meant missing the opportunity of being an xbox series xs launch title the studio held multiple technical testsduringsummer this gave players the ability to provide input into the direction of infinite freetoplay multiplayerthe community along with the flighting program helped us not only for mcc but helped us pave the way for the studio as you seeing now with infinite and their technical betas and flights fahrny says we been leading the charge and feeding all that back into the wider studio teams so that we can continue this great process that really helped us succeed as well it been really good to seeduring the xbox anniversary livestream on november xbox and industries announced a surprise softlaunch of the halo infinite multiplayer giving all players immediate entry to a beta that provides access to the full suite in the lead up to launch on december players have already provided feedback on things like the slow progression of the multiplayer battle pass and members of industries have already been implementing changesnow as the team moves forward into what appears to be a very promising new chapter it carries with it the valuable oftenharshlessons it learned following the troubling launch of halo the master chief collection in doing so the team hopes that all subsequent launches will avoid the need to bounce back in the manner that its celebratory compilation had towith developers now interacting with the community on such a collaborative level it clear that the lifecycle of the master chief collection changed the course of industries for the betterto learn more about halo infinite be sure to visit

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/22/inside-the-nintendo-power-hotline,Inside The Nintendo Power Hotline,kyle hudson didnt know what nintendo was but it was he was just back from boot camp and he needed a job his friend jeff palmer suggested they both go work for nintendo palmers cousin cliff worked there as a gameplay counselor he got paid to play video games all day hudson and palmer could do that too the latter saidjeff sold it to me like hey were gonna sit in a cubicle and play games all day and answer phone calls hudson recalls and i was like hell yeahin nintendo launched its nintendo power hotline if a player encountered problems beating a video game they could call the hotline and get advice from what nintendo called a gameplay counselor it was effectively a call center it was also so much more than thatby the time nintendo shut the hotline down in gameplay counselors had helped millions it became a part of video game history fondly remembered decades later by children that called for some kids gameplay counselors were heroes they were literally people who got paid to play video games all day for others counselors were the first people in their lives to talk seriously with them about games for many counselors themselves the call center launched their careers both within and outside of nintendo despite not knowing what nintendo was in when he applied hudson stayed with the company until more than two decades after taking his first call he had worked his way up to nintendos product testing managerto get an idea of what it was like to work at the nintendo power hotline we recently spoke with people talking to a wide variety of former counselors and people that called the hotline growing up we got a flyonthewall look at what it was like to be part of this point in nintendos history we also learned a lot about nintendo of americas culture in the and spearheaded by its former president minoru arakawanintendo wasnt picky about who could be a gameplay counselor in the earliest stages all a person needed was to show up at one of the many temp agencies employed to fill seats and complete an application if the temp agency called back the first interview was breezyit was basically can you work this shift do you have reliable transportation just basic stuff hudson says are you breathing are you warmblooded okayit was when people got to nintendo that the process intensified the company billed gameplay counselors as video game experts if you had a problem with a game the professional gamers in nintendos redmond wash office could help you no matter how complicated or niche the issue may bewhile nintendo didnt require any of its counselors to actually enjoy games once a person made it past the initial temp interview it did require a weekslong training process new employees had to play through games learn about their various chokepoints and secrets and take a massive test before they could field callsinstead of just answering one very simple question about legend of zelda maybe you have to list all of the treasures in all of the dungeons in both quests says former counselor caesar filori how do you get to the minus world in mario how many coins do you need for an extra life they just wanted to make sure you actually knew the games inside and out and the mechanics and how to beat the bossesbut ill be honest with you myself and a lot of people at that time we cheated through the test hudson admits because i was like theres no way im gonna remember all this safter a short shadow period where new counselors would sit in while an experienced counselor took calls they finally got on the phones calls were immediate and plentifulits hard to nail down exactly how many calls a counselor would get on a given day though most approximations land around per shift at its height the call center had a couple hundred people taking calls for just under hours a day if each person is taking around calls per day in total the call center was receiving thousands of calls every day it was in operation sam hosier iii who worked there between and says at one point nintendo gave out a shirt that said we had done million callsof course this number was exacerbated by the holiday season when people across the country were getting new nintendo games and consoles the counselors dubbed this hell weekwhen we had our full call center they put up these telecaster boards that showed you how many calls were inqueue former counselor yvette kirby waters says about hell week we called it the hellecaster because you could feel the pressure when calls are inqueue you know and there were over people in the call center taking calls one after another boom boom boom and yet the queue list is still in the hundredseven though nintendo required a certain level of memorization and expertise it was understood gameplay counselors couldnt know everything every one of those millions of callers inquired about to help with tough calls each counselor had a large green binder full of notes handdrawn maps and solutions get good enough at passive conversation and a caller on the other end of the line would never know a counselor was quickly flipping through pages trying to find an answer to them it might seem like this person is the allknowing gamer nintendo was pitching them as in its thenmonthly magazine nintendo power in each issue individual counselors were highlighted in the counselors corner featuring tidbits such as their highest game score and favorite nintendo games letting callers put faces to the voices on the nintendo power hotlinedespite the sheer number of calls as every counselor we talked to tells it after long enough working the phones you start to identify the most common questions across nintendos most popular games they may have taken over a hundred calls a day but most of those calls were about the same two or three games work there long enough and you can spend a lot of your day on autopilotonce you heard the question the response coming out of your mouth you really didnt have to think about it hudson saysthis left gameplay counselors a lot of time to play video games on the clock somewhat making good on the dream kids had that these were people who got paid to play games all day in the nintendo office was an evergrowing library with every single game the company had released up to that point there were no gaps in the collection hosier sayscounselors could check out various titles and their desks even had tvs and consoles where they could play games while taking callsone of the risks that you have doing that is if youre someone who emotes when you die when you play a game that can become problematic filori says adding employees got good at muting the call i dont remember who it was but i do know for fact a time where somebody got the mic button muting reversed so all the person heard on the other end was profanitygaming in the office led to many nowfamous pictures while ostensibly letting counselors play games on the clock was so they could stay uptodate and familiar with all nintendos games these photos worked doubleduty as great recruitment tools kids could see counselors sitting in an office cubicle making money and playing games who wouldnt think that was coolthe concept of gameplay counselors back in the day for a kid obsessed with nintendo games was kind of this dream job phil theobald who called the hotline as a kid says in my head i had this vision of gameplay counselors as like the best job in the worldthere were however the nightmare calls for example the goonies based on the movie of the same name released by konami in as filori tells it most of the areas in the game look identical it was nearimpossible to identify where a player was stuck same with legacy of the wizard hal laboratorys puzzler adventures of lolo was another pain point for gameplay counselorsi mean these are like the candy crushes of the time says former counselor casey pelkey about lolo people would call and theyre in like the level or something like that theyre like give me stepbystep and were talking block by block how to do something it can take forever and as soon as they do something wrong its a reset right lets try it againlots of people would hang up on those calls filori says then because the supervisors could still hear what youre saying even once youve wrapped up since they would monitor calls for quality they would just keep talking theyd hang up and keep talking and then say like um are you still there are you still there hello hellojack sapperstein was on vacation in st thomas island when he got stuck on a boss in the final fantasy legend released by square in despite the longdistance charges required to call the nintendo power hotline sapperstein who grew up in new york city says his parents generally understood when he asked at home to call the nintendo people however in hindsight he admits calling from the caribbean was a bit outrageoussapperstein was one of the millions of kids who bought into nintendos marketing around gameplay counselors he really thought these were allknowing game fans who could answer every question under the sun without much second thoughti just always felt like it was so official and they were always kind of getting these answers off the top of their heads he says as if i was talking to mario himselfand so he called a lot not just for games he was stuck on sometimes sapperstein called with impossible questions like how to unlock vega on the super nintendo port of street fighter ii he wasnt alone ben rico who grew up in the san francisco bay area called the hotline numerous times rico says he was convinced there was a way to not automatically go down the pipe at the end of world he called the gameplay counselors to try and confirm his suspicioni was sitting there like theres gotta be a way to not automatically get sucked into it rico says because i was you know a fing kid i might have even been the gameplay counselor very nicely to this little kid said that no theres no way to do it you get sucked in you have to go to the next levelsaperstein and rico are what gameplay counselors refer to as regulars while the hotline did require longdistance charges for anyone outside of the redmond area code that didnt stop people from calling so much that counselors began to remember them somehow standing out among the thousands of other people they talked to every week in some cases these were just people who wanted someone to talk with in other cases they were dreaded calls people counselors hated talking to but in even more cases they were just kids entirely beside themselves with the idea of talking to their heroes people that worked at nintendothe nintendo power hotlines years of operation coincide exactly with nintendos rise in popculture prominence and the video game industrys in general moreso than ever before people were playing video games and here was this entire service built around helping people play their games while young male children made up a lot of calls according to those we talked to people from all walks of life also called the hotlinethere were some grandparents who were passionate about this waters says maybe they started as a way to play with their grandkids but they really got into itthe importance of talking to that many people and more importantly that many nintendo fans was not lost on founder and thenpresident of nintendo of america minoru arakawa who impressed upon counselors that they were providing a service for people who loved nintendo treating them with patience and kindness was paramount admittedly they were also helpful marketingmr arakawa i remember him conveying to us through the managers that this is how we make this business successful says pelkey who later worked as vp of marketing at the tetris company where arakawa served as president until if we dont get people through the games then theyre not going to want to buy the next onemore so than many executives people talk about arakawa with an absolute level of respect and appreciation a lot of the people we interviewed for this piece were teenagers or young adults when they first joined nintendo the call center was their first job and of course it was an entrylevel one but arakawa and his management team were insistent that should people put the work in being a gameplay counselor could be a first step towards a career within nintendo it didnt matter how low someone was on the totem pole or what department they worked in there was always room to go up at arakawas nintendohe was a very kind generous man hudson says i mean what other ceos knew every single employees namearguably however that generosity did come back to bite arakawa at least a couple of timesfor a brief period and in the and nintendo spared no expense when throwing its annual holiday party it would rent out entire floors of luxury hotels in downtown seattle offer hotel rooms and limo rides to and from for every employee so they wouldnt need to worry about finding a sober driver and give them topshelf food and drink nintendo invited every employee not just its csuite former counselors we talked to describe being in awe of the parties but for a group made up of many teenage boys and young men in their things quickly got out of hand once alcohol got involvedi do know some stories of people whose names i cant remember and its probably good that i dont who lost their job after a christmas party because of inappropriate behavior and apparently actually broke an elevator at the sheraton in seattle waters says i dont know how you do that maybe they put too many people in the elevator or whatever but they managed to get an elevator stuckthey ended up having to stop doing that hudson says about the holiday parties they were destroying these rooms and nintendo was hearing about it from the hotels that only lasted a year or two before they put a kibosh on that toono one we spoke to for this piece had anything negative to say about the culture of nintendo or the call center at this time however with years of hindsight waters does admit the culture probably wouldnt be acceptable by standards likening the call center office to a college dorm it was also majority white and majority male however she does point out that her team the bilingual call center employees which served spanishspeaking callers and french canadians was largely femalein the call center there was a lot of things probably going on that i would say people would recognize now as inappropriate but at the time it was still sort of that fun thing where this organization was established by young people she saysso you know theres some things you look at now and go woah waters adds laughingthe nintendo power hotline ran until it was a major part of nintendo of americas daytoday business eventually the green binders were replaced by a computer system called elmo or electronic manual organizer which streamlined looking up and finding answers but after a while technology phased out the need for gameplay counselors if every walkthrough is easily accessible online for free why would you pay to call the hotline especially after it switched to a tolled number from its original redmond area code numberbut if theres one thing that stands out and one thing that makes it unique its that its remembered at all there are numerous other call centers in the world few of which have any longstanding legacy much less any as fondly remembered as nintendosa simple reason for this is the call center focused on fun video games it also helped that arakawa required people in the call center to be kind to the people calling in beyond that even he required every single letter sent to nintendo of america to get a response there was an entire team within the customer service office dedicated to just answering mail as far as customer service goes it was hard to beat nintendo at this timestephan reese whos dedicated his life to collecting nintendo ephemera and runs the art of nintendo power education exhibit describes it succinctly this was the first time many people had taken their hobby seriously it was the first time people didnt talk down to them about liking video gamesit really was a friend for a lot of these kids says reese who called the hotline once when he was around specifically a friend who spoke their language who knew what they were talking about who loved games as much as they did and was able to articulate that backthese were the only adults in my life who were not openly mocking something that i love more than anything reese addsthe call center was the first step to joining the game industry for the counselors we interviewed waters later worked on the nintendo gamecube software development kit before moving on to a job at microsoft shes now a selfemployed contract strategist hosier worked as an event production coordinator and assistant manager of trade events at nintendo before spending time at other tech companies like tmobile after working as a tester for nintendo filori worked for ea microsoft nike and oculus hes now a technical programmer at meta the list goes onbut for all of them it started in that call centersometimes you hear about something being this golden age right filori says it felt like a golden age at the time this is different its something new its different this is a unique thing i dont know that it could ever be recreated or replicated to be part of the explosion of video games at the timeit was weird he adds it was a very weird and unique thingthis article originally appeared in

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/23/the-best-heroes-and-villains-of-2021,The Best Heroes And Villains Of 2021,a new year a new slew of video game heroes and villains this year had a lot of great standouts from characters we met for the first time to old favorites narrowing down our favorites wasn easy but after much deliberation here are our top picks for the best heroes and villains of note neither list is ordered so just because one character comes before or after another doesn mean we consider them better or worse in any wayethan winters resident evil villagethe best horror protagonists are relatable people who find their circumstances both as terrifying and hardtobelieve as we would in the same situation this is what makes ethan winters such a good lead in the two resident evil games he starred in resident evil biohazard and this year excellent resident evil villageethan is completely beside himself with his surroundings compared to other resident evil protagonists who often have more in common with the terminator than laurie strode throughout the runtime of village he disgusted horrified and sometimes even annoyed with all the bad happening to him and others when first confronted by a pack of werewolves in the game opening ethan is relatably scared out of his wits when he stalked mercilessly by lady dimitrescu see below through her impossibly large castle he runs away and hides when the end of the game rolls around ethan feels exasperated and annoyed completely over the horror he seemingly will never escapefor a game as horrific as village ethan relatability grounds the game scares we see how we too would likely react in similar situations through his reactions while he might not be the most interesting or charismatic character on this list he is at least a character we can see ourselves throughalex chen life is strange true colorsalex chen is empathy personified which sounds a bit on the nose typing it out but somehow life is strange true colors pulls this offwe were wowed by actress erika mori performance of alex the latest in a long line of great life is strange protagonists mori believable and human portrayal allowed us to fit into alex world easily allowing us to relate to her care about her wellbeing and want to make decisions that worked best for her future her humor and charm were simply the cherries on topalex is one of the best heroes of the year because her power of empathy helps us to care about others in this game world helping us as the player to relate sympathize and work for a better future in this universerazputin raz acquatto psychonauts all the characters on this list razputin raz acquatto might be the purest of heart at his core raz is a kid that just wants to help people even if he often fumbles along the wayraz is a welcome change of pace compared to most characters in bigbudget firstpartydeveloped video games especially up against one of microsoft other main characters from this year master chief who while acting nobly as determined by the fiction is still killing scores of people raz playful innocence and tendency to question the world around him in a way that doesn require loss of life and limb is a wonderful breath of fresh airraz writing by tim schafer founder of developer double fine productions brings a healthy dose of humanity to the character he is passionate and naive in equal measure the same way most kids are while schafer being the sole writer on psycnoanuts does tend to feel pretty onenote after enough hours the care and thought put into its protagonist shouldn go understated schafer excellently walks a tightrope between making raz the character we remember from original psychonauts while updating him for sensibilitiesin a year full of new games for legacy characters ratchet and clank and the aforementioned master chief to name a few raz stands out as one of the freshest video game characters of the yearkit ratchet clank rift apartat the very least kit is the most adorable character of the year but that selling this robot a bit short in a game full of great characters including but not limited to longtime fanfavorites ratchet and clank kit stands out for her unique approach to the game world selflessness in the face of danger and ability to bring people back together from the brink of collapsethough kit past is marred by tragedy and her present colored by depression by the time credits roll on ratchet clank rift apart she gone through a whole hero journey coming out the other end a new selfconfident and sureofherself robot we hope to see more of her in future ratchet clank games because not only is she one of the best characters of she the best character the series has had in yearscolt vahn deathloopit hasn been colt vahn day for a couple years what a couple more trapped in a timeloop asked to complete a nearimpossible task kill eight targets within hours or repeat the same day this poor man just wants to go home but whine as he might until his job is done he doomed to repeat the same cycle over againnot too unlike ethan winters above colt works as a character mainly because he relatable given his ingame circumstances deathloop makes no bones about the fact being trapped in a timeloop would suck and colt perfectly captures how we all might react to repeating the same day ad infinitum with anger annoyance and confusionall of this is lifted entirely by voice actor jason e kelley who turns in one of the best performances of the year as colt funny sarcastic charming and occasionally mean kelley seamlessly transitions between colt various emotions as deathloop goes on giving him depth and personality tack on the game excellent writing and you have an easy pick for one of the best characters of the yearlady dimitrescu resident evil villagethere are two huge reasons the internet adhered itself to resident evil village lady dimitrescu earlier this year one was simply put her looks she hot the other was the way she wielded her sexuality in a way that was both seductive and terrifying she the type of character you can help but find yourself drawn to despite your fear but by then it much too latethough she only in a handful of hours lady d as the internet likes to call her is the standout antagonist of village cast functioning nearidentically to the everstalking mr x in the resident evil remake lady d constantly stalks protagonist ethan winters and by extension us the player as he tries to find his way through and out of her castle toying with our fear insulting our intelligence and most memorably mutilating our bodies she proves beyond a shadow of a doubt who in control in this situationand yet despite this lady d is a character the internet has proved itself infatuated with before village was even released fanart and cosplay flooded the internet as did a slew of tweets expressing how much the sender wanted lady d to enact her violent and terrifying means of cruelty on themselves by the time the game came out lady d excellently portrayed by actress maggie robertson seemed to acknowledge the internet thirst for her playing her character menacingly sure but also flirtatiously and seductively add on a character design that leaves little to the imagination and you have a surefire way to get the internet attentionit hard to think of any other character in that so captured the video game zeitgeist especially one so unimaginably cruel and for that we can think of anyone better to give our top acknowledgmentsjean baptiste no more heroes iiiafter returning to earth and reuniting with his human companion the fluffy adorable alien we met in no more heroes iiis opening moments called fu reveals himself to be a smarmy a galactic prince known as jess baptiste vi now that hes all grown up jess isnt just back to visit his now megarich ceo friend damon but to conquer the planet with his gang of space cronies in vile and violent waysjess baptiste vi is immature vindictive surly and will send his own friends to die at the blade of travis touchdown before getting his hands dirty despite his offputting nature fu does have a heart for those close to him often treating his comrades to a final meal before delivering them to their grizzly fate these quiet moments bring some surprising depth to the evil prince and his shortlived subordinates no more heroes iii is a game with many problems but its colorful villain does plenty to drive players through the galactic assassin ranks to see his eventual bitter endleshy inscryptioninscryption is host to a family of great villains but to even discuss most of them would spoil what makes the game so great in the first place one villain however is met almost immediately upon starting the partdeckbuilder partescape roomthriller and thats leshyleshy begins as ostensibly an adversary wanting to play cards with you lose a couple of matches and youll discover hes much more than that sure he wants to play cards but he also wants to watch you carve your own eye out just to defeat him toohe also expects you to play through his roguelike card game over and over until you can rise above all of its unfair rules and best the creepy old man that is leshy once and for all not only does he feature some great villain highlights hes a scary elderly man absolutely out of his mind intent on watching you endure pain and unwilling to let you leave his forest cabin hes also someone with more depth than one might perceive at first without spoiling what you might experience in inscryption leshy will appear in ways that will surprise you his ability to keep us on our toes through the games journey while also maintaining a sickly grin through it all is what makes him one of this years best and most memorable villainskaiju bowser bowser furyone of the most surprising games of might have been bowser fury a new packin game with the switch rerelease of super mario world and one of the most surprising things about bowser fury might just be that it has one of the best villains of the yearthe bowser of bowser fury is more or less the koopa we known for decades but this time he really big like really really big kaijulevel bigcompared to other villains on this list bowser might seem like a boring pick but in terms of bowser fury the monster constant threat ability to impede progress and uncanny ability to start a fight created a mario experience we hadn seen before one where danger was unexpected and menacingand let not avoid the elephant in the room here one of our favorite things about big bowser was that it gave us the chance to also play as kaiju mario in a cute little cat outfitjulianna blake deathloopdeathloop julianna blake is a great case of a villain not taking themselves too seriously sure she takes her cause seriously stop colt from breaking the loop but she not constantly monologuing about her mission she having fun reveling in the twisted rules of the game world and poking fun at colt every chance she gets in that sense it may be more accurate to call her deathloop greatest foil rather than antagonistwhile deathloop is by no means a dour game julianna writing stands out as some of the game most consistently funny portrayed by actress ozioma akagha coupled with the aforementioned performance by jason e kelley julianna constant banter with colt brings life to both characters highlighting their personalities oppositions beliefs and even senses of humor when the game finally plays its hand exposing the truth behind the two relationship the revelation adds a new sense of gravity to a lot of the conversations you heard throughout deathloopjulianna has charisma and charm she funny and easily likable she also not inherently evil and while that may make her a bit of an outlier in a best villains list of the video game characters we met in she stands out as one of our favorites to go up againstwhile writing this i realized that laurie strode has more in common these days with the terminator than she does her humble beginnings as a scared teenager in the original halloween this is largely why the halloween reboot is a terrible movie though by no means is it the only reasonwhat makes laurie such an iconic character in the film is her complete lack of control faced by the alwayspresent alwaysstalking michael myers she has no choice but to hide scream and cry by the end when she does fight back her victory over myers feels more like a lucky break than any heroic good deedbut when we meet laurie in the reboot inexplicably she has undergone firearms training akin to a military member and somehow fortified her tiny house with enough protection to make fort knox blush none of this makes sense considering the movie paints her as an alcoholic that can hold a job or her life together which it worth pointing out is handled with as much taste and class as a wrecking ball perpetuating harmful stereotypes about addictionanyways let this annotation serve to remind the reader that i solely mean laurie characterization in the original halloween moviedepending on how you look at deathloop there a fair read that colt is actually the villain and julianna is the hero even then it might be safer to consider them both morally ambiguous both act for selfish and noble reasons and their disparate causes directly clash with each other in other words in julianna world she is the hero and colt is the villain in colt world vice versa see note

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/11/25/the-divine-comedy-of-immortals-fenyx-rising,The Divine Comedy Of Immortals Fenyx Rising,a powerful titan of legend has launched a massive assault on the greek gods of mythology severing them from their essence smashing open cracks to the underworld and infesting earth with corrupted beings from the afterlife a setup like this isn uncommon in the world of video games but when it comes to comedy a dark premise such as this isn the first thing you might think of however that exactly the direction ubisoft quebec went with immortals fenyx risingwhile theinspiration drawn from games like the legend of zelda breath of the wild or studio ghibli films likehowl moving castleis evident in the gameplay and visual style it was a different genre of film that dictated the tone ubisoft quebec employs with immortals fenyx rising i felt like a lot of video games are incredibly dark and i had missed this feeling from childhood that movies like the princess bride or naked gun or airplane had given me i felt like cant a video game have that kind of tonesays narrative director jeffrey yohalem it got tipped in that direction by the fact that greek mythology is actually full of comedy unlike our religion today which is seen as a moral compass where everything is very serious and is how you should act if you were a perfect person or a perfect deity for the greeks their mythology was like their soap opera or their reality television where youre seeing people who are just like us making mistakes and youre learning from the things in the stories that result in tragedyaccording to cinematic team lead michelle plourde the team desire to make a humorous game started during the development of assassin creed odyssey what we learned from odyssey was that we really enjoyed making funny lighthearted types of stories in gamesshe says we took what we learned from odyssey and where that kind of shined through and we transferred that into fenyx rising but instead of making that where you see instances of the story being funny at some points we tried to make it so its a comedy instead of this type of serious gamethe entirety of immortals fenyx rising is narrated by zeus and prometheus to say these twohave a complicated relationship would be an understatement when the titans and gods clashed for the first time prometheus was one of the few titans who sided with the gods so the two are basically old war buddies as well as cousins however the relationship soured when prometheus fell in love with humanity and stole fire from olympus to give to the humans to punish prometheus for this betrayal zeus chained him to the side of a mountain and has an eagle peck out his liver every day before it regenerates every night however the typhon crisis made them realize they need each other so prometheus weaves a tale of fenyx a mortal who will save the gods from the doom they are facingwhile prometheus is the driving force of the narrative zeus chimes in with jokes however he can also serve as an unreliable narrator sometimes going as far as hijacking the story because he bored by what prometheus is saying in one instance when fenyx dives into the first vault of tartaros zeus is certain it would be deadly for a mortal so he cues a fake credits scroll where either he or prometheus islisted in every role a bit later the first boss battle occurs because zeus is bored and decides it a good time for fenyx to fight a cyclopsthe unreliable narrator mechanic was a way to shake up the storytelling of immortals fenyx rising while also adding some humor into the mix we thought it added flaresays plourde we have these feuding family members so why not make use of them and have what theyre saying come to life on screen since they are telling a story why not make use of it as a kind of gameplaynarrative tool its a tool to have them bicker and be different obviously zeus can take over control of the story because hes present with prometheus so why notthe humor isn limited to just zeus and prometheus in fact as you rescue the defeated gods and reunite them the hall of the gods starts to come to life and you should expect some lively conversations once the gods see their old peers the hall of the gods becomes kind of like a beach house in a reality show game director scottphillips says as you free the gods youre adding voices to that cacophony and theyre all interacting with each other they have this huge backstory and some of them love each other and some of them hate each otherover the early moments of the game players can expect references to airplane turbulence and a joke about shoes when fenyx encounters nike the goddess of victory the game may take place in ancient greece but ubisoft quebec didn shy away from some winks at the player in the century the line was almost only drawn where a joke would age badly as in people years from now wouldnt get the jokeyohalem says the

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/09/11/designing-kena-bridge-of-spirits-fierce-and-compassionate-protagonist,Designing Kena: Bridge of Spirits’ Fierce And Compassionate Protagonist,a lot rests on the shoulders of a games protagonist after all the player has to embody that character and should be drawn to them and their world in ember labs kena bridge of spirits were transported to a beautifully animated spiritual realm just begging to be explored kena is our guide she has an aura of mystery around her but also radiates a kind warmth plus shes got to be pretty awesome if all those adorable rot want to help her while learning more about kena bridge of spirits for this months cover story we couldnt resist finding out more about our leading lady and the story behind her creationbelieve it or not kena was not always the star of the ember labs debut game early prototypes focused more on the black critters called the rot experimenting with them as the antagonists and then relying heavily on them in and out of battle to drive the game in fact kena was not even in the teams first prototype she was part of the next one we did and it was fleshing out her story and the story of what makes her unique and why the rot trusts her and connects with her that was a big part of her development and the look of her and the abilities that we wanted her to have says chief creative officer mike grierin earlier prototypes kena was much younger around seven or eight years old but that changed as the team thought more about the story and what was at the core of it as we developed more of a story and the themes and we knew we wanted her to be a spirit guide to help these spirits move on she needed a little more experience to do that grier explains shes still a younger spirit guide but it didnt feel right to have her being a child trying to empathize with these darker more adult themesember lab liked the idea of having kena and the rot come together for a common goal of restoration and the evolution started there as we started developing her character and the idea of her guiding spirits and helping out other humans thats when she started to really get her own identity and we wanted to make her so on her own she can stand toetotoe with these bigger spirits and i think that gives her a lot of what people connect with when they see her and why people like her so much grier saysonce ember lab had settled on kena and some of her core characteristics it was time to start putting together her design the team enlisted the help of its lead character designer vic kun a longtime ember lab collaborator who has been building a name for himself in the chinese animation scene since she is our main hero we developed many versions and explored variations in color kun says we struggled a bit to find a balance between kenas design fitting into the world while still allowing her to stand out our overall mood and tone of the environment is usually very forested and sometimes quite dark in the shadows of treesdue to these challenges some concessions needed to be made before deciding on kenas look we decide to use percent offwhite on her clothes and mix in earth tone as much as possible kun says mike and i also tried to work in a long cape element to help kena stand out a bit in the foliage but when animation started adding natural movement to the piece it ended up being distracting so we changed that into a tighter shawl it still has some movement and helps break up kenas outlineeven the little details mattered such as making sure the needlework was visible on kenas shawl and pants the main idea of the design for her costume is asymmetry in every detail and adding a handcrafted element kun explains we tried to make her clothes feel handmade practical and functional the team also added details to the symbols to create a unique culture for the game we drew inspiration from japanese and south east asian cultures to inform the designs of our symbols kun saysone part of kenas appearance that will get more explored in the narrative is a scar on her arm you just see a little bit on her hand but it actually runs up her whole arm onto her shoulder grier says it represents this traumatic experience she had with her father because its a big plot point we wont spoil anything on how she gets it or how it impacts the plot but she does form a special connection with the first rot she meets due to itat its core kena bridge of spirits is a more peaceful journey that has her being one with nature and on a quest mainly to restore peace and help troubled spirits in need still ember lab wanted her to have some conflict and cool powers to handle it the team experimented with a lot of different ideas at one point the rot ran the entire show originally she didnt have many abilities of her own she was kind of basically like a boy and his blob you cant stand on your own you need the blob to do everything for you grier shareshowever as the team played around more with different concepts they settled on something that felt right and made sense for kena as a spirit guide one of the ways that weve done that was making sure that kena feels powered up with her spirit energy and with the rot so it doesnt feel like shes the hulk by herself says designer liz fiacco theres this magical edge to our combat trying to make enemies threatening so it feels like she needs to defend herself as opposed to shes come here to lay waste to all these threats in the forest i think those two seem to be the angles weve used to keep kena consistent through combatember lab also wanted to ensure that combat felt realistic to kenas abilities and power after all she is facing off against enraged spirits she battles some pretty big spirits and we want them to feel intimidating grier says a design goal for every combat game is what do you want the combat to feel like when youre with kratos youre just ultimate power but kena gets tossed around a lot if she gets hit by a big attack shell go flying and we wanted to make her feel vulnerable in that sense shes strong but shes not this brutish sort of combatantkena may not be overpowered but she can make up for it in interesting ways she can call in the rot for help to damage and distract enemies once their courage meter is high enough use her pulse ability to produce a bubble that acts as a shield or smack enemies with light and heavy attacks using her staff she can even turn said staff into a bow for ranged attackskena isn as big as the spirits she faces but she can use her agility to her advantage as well kenas mobility is something that ive been pushing for and its been a challenge making enemies being able to keep up with her because she can sprint run double jump but i think her mobility is really fun grier sayswhile kena bridge of spirits certainly feels like a whimsical adventure teeming with childlike wonder in discoveries and adorable characters it also deals with some more serious and contemplative subject matter kenas journey will be an emotional one at times kenas connecting with these spirits and having to let them go and were trying to put that same sort of emotional weight in the players hands as much as we can grier says if we can nail that and nothing else ill be happyas kena helps out others she learns about herself and gains something hopefully beyond sympathy but more toward empathy and understanding things adds designer jessica kernan that can kind of help her further her own personal development which in turn helps her help other people so were touching on these big lofty ideas of how experience even the bad things can lead us to relating better to other humans basicallyit sounds like kena bridge of spirits has plenty of wisdom to offer and we will learn it through kena who ember labclearly put a lot of thought into creating and making unique,en,542.0,Positive
gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/08/09/everything-we-know-about-call-of-duty-modern-warfares-campaign,Everything We Know About Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare’s Campaign,call of duty modern warfare is already showing promise with its multiplayer however for many the singleplayer campaign isan important part of the equation after treyarch opted to not include a full story mode with black ops last year infinity ward is bringing it back in a big way while at infinity ward for this months cover story we got the lowdown on what players can expect from call of duty modern warfares ambitious campaignwhen call of duty modern warfare launched in it told a contemporary story about two sides fighting a more traditional war however in warfare is different in the world of insurgents terrorists and freedom fighters sides arent as clearly defined as theyre depicted in call of duty modern warfare with that in mind the campaign team at infinity ward led by a group of naughty dog alumni set out to create something unique intense and unprecedented in the firstperson shooter spacethe studio says that the definition of modern warfare has changed and with that the teams approach to creating a modern warfare game also has to change thematically in this world enemies dont necessarily wear uniforms campaign gameplay director jacob minkoff says the world is not as clear war is much more messy these days were representing that mechanicallyduring the campaign you must identify threats as you move through the mission in one of the two missions we saw a squad is methodically working through a townhouse serving as a terrorist safehouse the player is in control of sergeant kyle garrick who believes the rules of war need to adapt in order to fight an enemy that doesnt play fair garrick wants to cross the line in his fight against the enemy and he seeks out captain john price in hopes hell see things his way in the townhouse mission infinity ward shows what that meansthe team of soldiers breach the townhouse at different points the front door a secondstory window the basement and immediately begin securing or neutralizing every inhabitant kyle enters the kitchen as his squadmate subdues a woman who obliviously wandered in a quick walk down the hallway reveals a meeting room with a few members talking loudly kyle equips nightvision goggles and shoots out the light and the team picks them off one by one you can approach scenarios like this one differently if you don shoot out the lights before engaging the enemies have a better chance of seeing you coming the squad continues up the stairs encountering different scenarios along the way one room has a woman who runs to grab a crying baby while another has a man take a woman as a human shield kyle neutralizes the hostagetaker only for the woman to grab a gun and come at the squadif you shoot the guy as we did in that demo she goes and grabs a gun minkoff says we train the player early on that you really need to be identifying threats and this all came from us talking to our military consultants they dont talk about civilians and noncombatants there are unknowns and threatssituations like that require players to identify hostile actions and hostile intents warfare isnt always black and white and likewise threats can also be more ambiguous in games hostile action is a really simple thing studio narrative director taylor kurosaki says its like someones shooting at me hostile intent is a whole other ballgame those are the metrics they have to deal with and navigateas the team continues up the stairs some more obvious threats present themselves one room has a man grab a gun and hide under the bed to ambush you nothing a few shots through the mattress cant handle as the team approaches the attic a shotgun blast erupts through the door downing one of your squadmates every single surface features appropriate penetrative properties meaning that drywall and wooden doors are easier to shoot through than metal doors and concrete similarly a pistol will have trouble shooting through plate armorthe squad finally reaches the attic price remarks that the primary target is in there and that kyle should try and take her alive if possible kyle peeks in to spot a woman standing in the shadowy loft kyle downs her with a shot to the lower body but she lunges for something on the table kyle takes one shot to her head killing her so much for taking her alive however as price and kyle approach the table they see what she was reaching for a detonator minkoff and kurosaki tell me that if she grabbed the detonator in time it would blow up the townhouse killing the squad and giving the player a gameover screen price tells kyle he made the right callplayers need to make tough calls like that on the fly and while dying obviously leads to a critical mission failure its not the only way the game sort of has its own version of you just got court marshaled and arrested kurosaki saysif you cause too much collateral damage which is the official term for killing people who should not have been killed the game will fail you minkoff addswe have pretty complex heuristics where were basically trying to determine are you the player acting like a proper soldier or are you kind of being a psychopath and not playing by the rulesdespite this emphasis of wanting players to identify threats modern warfares campaign will not rely on random elements to keep you guessing or branching narratives based on your choices for the sake of replayability we want you to have the highest quality cinematic experience we can possibly create thats what we did at naughty dog thats what we do here minkoff says by necessity branching and randomization diminishnarrative quality and theres a place for that in video games im a huge fan of big openworld games that have lots of randomization but no one has ever said that those games have great stories were in the business of making the best possible cinematic story experience thats why its linearwhether youre talking experiencing a nuclear explosion firsthand or doing the unthinkable in the controversial no russian mission the modern warfare series has traditionally featured scenes that have players talking long after they put the controller down with call of duty modern warfare putting such an emphasis on storytelling and the darker more complex side of contemporary combat infinity wards latest campaign is sure to have memorable moments but will it have a defining transcendent sceneaccording to campaign gameplay director jacob minkoff this isnt just a question fans and journalists ask him his fellow developers at infinity ward and activision also pose this question to him repeatedly theyre like wheres your blanketyblankscene he says there are so many of those at this point that people have stopped asking that questionthe answer is its the whole game studio narrative director taylor kurosaki says i could come up with a list of like eight different things that it could be who knows what it will bewhile you play as kyle garrick for loosely half of the campaign players can expect a differentexperience for the rest of the game in this portion you play as a cia operative known simply as alex alex is stationed in the fictional middle eastern nation of urzekstan to enable and collaborate with local rebels one local rebel alex is working with is farahfarah was born into violence the second gameplay sequence i see is a flashbackthat begins with you playing as a young farah being pulled from the rubble of a house that was hit with an explosive her mother lifeless body is crumpled beside her but a group of rescuers is able to remove the debris and reach the little girl the remainder of the sequence involves sneaking through the town with her father in order to get home to her brother hadir using a screwdriver to take down a massive russian soldier who broke into the house and killed her father in front of her dodging pockets of gas and trying to escape the town unnoticedthis sequence gives a painful look at the life farah has led giving more meaning to how she acts in the modernday missions unlike kyle garrick who wants to destroy the enemy by any means necessary farah has a strong grasp of right and wrong andrefuses to cross the line and sacrifice her humanity to win the battlefarah is fighting a war on two fronts the russian forces occupying her country as well as those who would do terrible things to regain control of their home her magnetic true north is that shes going to fight in a way that doesnt diminish her own humanity kurosaki says if that means i lose because im not willing to resort to whatever tactics are necessary then so be it i lose because if i reduce my own sense of humanity in order to win then theres nothing left to fight for thats a big driver of what defines herwith those two characters opposing dynamics at play in the story along with bold presentations of difficult situations inspired by realworld events one of infinity wards main goals is to make players feel empathy the old games definitely made you feel a certain sense of empathy but in a very detached way minkoff says what we bring to the mix is a much more developed sense of character i want you to empathize with every one of these characters with all their perspectives and say i understand why you did that but i dont agree with it i want you to understand the complexity of modern war and empathize with the reasons why different people have different perspectives understanding different peoples narratives is super super importantkurosaki understands that not everyone who plays a call of duty story is there for those kinds of messages but he hopes that even those who just want to shoot through a fun popcornmoviestyle campaign will still take something away shining a light on this other half of modern warfare that maybe is not as covered in the news is also one of our goals he says with a platform as big as call of duty modern warfare for someone who doesnt read very deeply into the news of the world to shine a light on a character like farah who is very much based on people that are in the real world today and empathize with and understand that war isnt just something that happens therethe story of call of duty modern warfare looks to be dark and complex giving players a lot to think about during and long after their playthrough according to art director joel emslie the campaigns ending could have gone horribly wrong if not for the careful handling of the development team i watched the end of it i highly suggest if you get to play the game you play it all the way through singleplayer he says the end of the game is so fing awesome and its just great storytelling it has such a great payoffwith so many touchy subjects and emotionally heavy moments promised throughout the campaign of modern warfare itll be interesting to

several members of the development team during our hitman cover story and we were able to play our way through the games first three missions we wrote at length about the dubai and dartmoor levels but much about berlin was offlimits for our prelaunch coverage now that the game is out were ready to share some of the behindthescenes insights about the missionfirst a quick spoiler warning if youre planning on playing hitman id recommend coming back to this after youve played through this particular mission there are some surprising things about it and much of its impact could be lost if you read too much beforehand i went into it without any knowledge about what was coming and i think the experience was stronger for it your mileage may vary of course but i wanted to bring it up sooner than laterby the time you begin the games third mission apex predator youve probably already developed a sense that io interactive is moving out of its comfort zone with these levels the first mission features a lot of verticality and a pair of targets who can be drawn close together for a memorable double kill the second mission dartmoor lets players try their hand at being a detective instead of their usual role as a freelance executioner the optional murder mystery is a complete change of pace with optional interrogations and investigations that can occur right out in the openat io interactive every mission begins with the team nailing down some key thematic words and phrases for dubai game director mattias engstrom gave the level designers and artists a few short terms including on top of the world open and airy and an inviting beginning dartmoors thematic direction included the phrase a house filled with secrets and the words ominous and vulnerable by the time the third mission rolls around players are dropped into a place where the words loneliness and isolation were used as creative springboards once youve played through it the significance is clearmidway through hitman narrative arc agent finds himself alone his former colleagues are dead or working against him what was supposed to be a meeting has transformed into a slaughter theres no friend on the other side of an earpiece players dont even know who their targets are as they emerge from a wooded area to find a sprawling club built within a decommissioned power plant it was always supposed to be a cold open and a bit surreal with whats going on engstrom says you dont really have anything or anyone here and is defining his own mission for the first timeeven though agent doesnt have any tactical support hes far from alone as you work your way into the facility you start to appreciate just how many people have packed themselves into the place this is our event location engstrom says like paris has a fashion show this is the rave event music can be heard upon approach with bass reverberating off the concrete when you descend into the actual club its a nearly overwhelming sensation the music is loud and its accompanied by a syncopated light showwe put a lot of effort into making it an authentic rave in berlin and a lot of effort into the music and we spent a lot of effort into making that crowd engstrom says players have to observe npcs to determine who the targets are which can be tricky considering the overall density of course agent can use that to his advantage as well slipping amid the crowd to conceal himself if a guard notices the suspiciousacting bald guyexecutive producer forest swartout large says that seeing the contentcomplete version of the rave for the first time was a career highlight i feel like its so much that experience up to that reveal and then you get inside and youre like oh my god mind blown she adds that she felt like seeing it all working together was something special i cried when i saw the rave and when i had the i have arrived moment it was totally emotional it hit me like a ton of bricksin a first for the series hitman composer niels bye nielsen also wrote all of the other music for the game instead of incorporating tracks from other sources one of the easytomiss details about the rave is how the npcs react to his work as the music builds and explodes the crowd will adjust their moves to simulate well dancing their moves are fairly convincing though swartout large recalls that it wasnt always quite that way we have this very tall vikingnorwegian animator named morten helgeland and he did the initial blockinganimation mocap and it was hilariousthat placeholder animation which to be clear was never intended to be included in the game made it look as though the dance floor was populated by fing dads engstrom says laughing as he mimes some decidedly uncool maneuversdancing dads notwithstanding the rave sequence is impressive on traditional displays but the team says it shines even brighter in playstation vr without a doubt that rave level is something where we grab people and say can you please come over and just go down on the dance floor says senior game designer eksil mohl because you can make a fist everybody has just been standing there mimes pumping a fist to the music and theyre saying this is insane this is insanelead game designer sidsel hermansen adds that being able to experience the club in vr is a nice reminder of how things used to be before the pandemic i havent been to a rave for a long time i havent been to a party i havent been to a concert and i usually do that a lot she says its actually been kind of a reminder its been a beautiful thing to be able to go

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/04/28/three-big-ways-grounded-nails-its-micro-scaled-setup,Three Big Ways Grounded Nails Its Micro-Scaled Setup,obsidians upcoming game grounded takes one of my favorite setups little guy in a big world and builds a complex survival adventure around it dont let the kidfriendly veneer throw you off at this scale the backyard is a perilous place with danger lurking around every corner or more accurately in this case around the other side of that titanic discarded juice box the setup got my attention but the studios attention to detail and determination to make the most of this unusual scale kept it with that in mind here are three big ways grounded is fulfilling the promise of its microsized worldwhen you start grounded you begin in what appears to be a rainforest everywhere you look is lush and green surprise those trees are actually blades of grass and if you look up you can see a tree house and other things youd notice in a backyard though they tower over you and are impossibly far away obsidian makes the most of this change in perspective not only pulling you down to ground level and showing you life at that scale but having fun with it toothings operate at a different level when youre a centimeter tall as an example surface tension is such that you can kick a blob of dew if you manage to knock one down from a plant and if you yourself happen to get knocked down from a plant you can slow down your fall by holding onto a tiny piece of dandelion fluff and gliding softly downill get into it more in an upcoming feature but the backyard is also home to a variety of objects such as discarded toys and other familiar sights here the team balanced how things would actually look at the scale with meeting your expectations weve noticed that there are some manmade objects that dont look quite right at the small scale says game director adam brennecke so think of a soda can or something else like even a quarter you imagine how big it is in your head and when you actually see it at that scale you think actually i thought it was going to be smaller or bigger so sometimes we fudge it a littleat this scale youre in danger of becoming the next meal for creatures youd ordinarily ignore groundeds backyard is like a lot of other backyards in that its home to a wide array of insects at one end of the scale theyll ignore you completely others are curious about this strange new intruder and want to get in close to size you up and unfortunately there are more than a few insects that would like nothing more than to munch on your tiny body like the crumb ithas become theyre all part of a larger ecosystem and your job is to find a safe place within itthats something that we wanted to try out and push the technology as best as we can to see where can we take the simulation aspect to where it feels like a living world where all the insects are doing their own thing brennecke says at first theyre not interested in you because they dont see you as a threat but then as you getstronger they see you as a threat and a hostile thing and theyll want to fight backtake the ants for example when you encounter them at first they regard you with curiosity theyll certainly fight back if you attack but otherwise theyre content to take a look at you and move along theyre more interested in food and fortunately you arent an obvious meal get between them and their next meal however and thats when trouble can formif theres something like a large apple core or a hot dog bit or a cookie the ants will actually form a trail to those large food objects and bite off a little piece and go back to their anthill brennecke says you can interact with the simulation in different ways you can build a base around that and the ants will ultimately be like hey what are you doing youre hoarding all the food and theyll send out soldier ants to go beat you up and destroy your defensesspiders and other aggressive insects arent quite as nuanced if they see you theyll immediately attack you arent getting in the way of their food you are the food or in the case of creatures such as bombardier beetles their corrosive spray will hurt your character regardless of the insects ultimate motivationsin true survivalgame fashion the trick is finding ways to explore the world safely to get crafting materials to further extend your range of exploration an analogy ive used in the past has been similar to an indiana jones movie where its action and excitement and theres a real sense of danger but it also has a level of approachability to it says lead environment artist sean dunny we want it to look recognizable like a backyard we wanted it to be this sort of pardon the pun largerthanlife and inviting world for you to be a part of where youre like ah theres danger out there but theres also excitement and adventureafter spending several hours with grounded i was most impressed with how much fun it was to simply explore the yard the team took great pains to make sure that something weird recognizable or interesting is just over the next hill or around the cornerone of the things that i really like just from a visual standpoint are the garden lights dunny says at night in our nighttime you see almost what looks like a lighthouse in the middle of the fog thats something that we talked about for nighttime gameplay it can be really imposing so having these points of light to act as landmarks during the night even these things that dont necessarily have direct gameplay impacts have this indirect thing where they provide a way to find your way around at nightthose lights come in handy since you never know what youll bump into in the dark each creature has a vital system that tracks its own hunger level andsleepiness level says art director kaz aruga if you follow something around like spiders for instance we have two types we have the orbweaver that roams around during the day and then we have the nocturnal wolf spider one type will go to sleep and the other type will come crawling out and the yard kind of shifts in that dynamic waywhatever the time of day grounded isnt just having you survive for survivals sake theres a reason why youve been shrunken down to this size even if you dont know what that is ive had a blast scouring this backyard inch by inch but lets face it once youve seen everything you need something to do beyond merely staying alive grounded is doing something a little different from other survival games in that its telling a structured story tooi got a glimpse of it while i played during the early moments of the game youre guided through the process of powering on several hightech pylons by a mysterious voice when activated these should help to return you to your normal size things dont go well and the machines eventually overload the demo ends just as you meet your helper a tiny robot named burglive played my share of survival games over the years but its not a genre im naturally drawn toward i like the freeform nature of these experiences but i also appreciate having more formalized goals and motivations i only dipped my toes in groundeds story but it seems like a fun mystery to dive into and it just happens to be one set in an innately fun location both to play in and to createi think everyone is staring at the ground now just looking and dissecting what theyre seeing brennecke says of his team that would be an interesting material to use or a little setting everyone is taking pictures of weird things that theyre finding on the ground this is a weird mushroom patch it might be a cool place to explore its been a lot of fun thinking about the things that you interact with on a daily basis at scale

spirits you have some adorable companions the rot who help spirit guide kena by doing everything from lending a hand in combat once they build up their courage aww to assisting her past various environmental obstacles your goal is to find these little critters throughout your travels and unite them slowly bonding with your adorable army who offer strength in numbers and follow you everywhere you go while the rot have their own mysterious background that we wont dare spoil we did unearth more about their creation and role heres what you need to know about your biggest asset that comes with a huge dose of cutethe rot are responsible for decomposing things something that plays into the game themes of regrowth and the cycle of life in fact during your adventure expect to see red corrupted areas which kena can cleanse by sending out the rot to break it down and give new life theres this theme of things both being broken and coming together but not in the same way explains designer jessica kernan you can never completely fix something thats been brokenhowever it can still take on this new life this helped the team decide to focus on bringing the rot together to do things instead of assigning them out separately as weve seen in series like pikminor overlord they did experiment with the latter but it just didnt feel right when we tried versions where you split them it felt like it was counterintuitive to the message kernan saysone big goal for me that i kept saying was i dont want to micromanage these guys in combat adds chief creative officer mike grier pikmin is keeping the guys alive and making sure theyre not getting killed i think a lot of people also think that the rot are going to die in combat once you collect them are they going to live forever i think that was an important pillar for us i think that speaks to what jessica is talking about bringing them together as you collect them you have more guys and youre assembling this family of rot but we didnt want them to be killed and be this currency that youre managing in combat to set the record straight the rot are permanent you dont have to worry about losing any of your buddies in combatyou can collect around different rot throughout the game and theyll provide you with various benefits we were always wanting the player to feel like its a collaborative relationship between kena and the rot explains designer casey holtz how can you make them feel like an extension of kena or a partnership where youre helping them get somewhere to do something that she cant do by herself the idea is that half of the power is kena and half of the power is the rot but together they can get through this adventurewhile the rot can handle corrupted areas and find creative solutions to overcome obstacles such as blocked paths they are also a great asset in combat well once they get enough courage all it takes is inspiring them with your prowess on the battlefield we have a system called rot courage where these enemies and these corrupted spirits are scaring the rot so whenever you go into battle your rot go into hiding says chief operating officer josh grier but the better kena performs the more courage they gain and the rot will join back into the battlefieldonce these little cuties get brave they can come together to lunge at enemies to distract them giving kena the upper hand so she can target weak points or sneak up for a deadly combo the more rot you collect the more abilities youll unlock and theyll help more in combat mike puts it matteroffactly the more you have the more things you can do however they arent there to steal kenas thunder and do the heavy lifting they mainly supplement her skills this can best be seen in her special abilities which rot power can be infused into for cool modifiers such as supercharging her arrows to penetrate multiple foes or turning her heavy melee attack into a hammerlike blow at the very least the rot always have your back which really helps cement your special bond with themlook ember lab knows the rot are charming and went through great detail to get them just right at one point josh joked about making cute characters as part of the companys calling card i know we had a lot more stylized more youthful fatter characters in some of our commercial work but nothing quite like the rot admits animation director hunter schmidt it was really important to me that they jiggle and they feel really loose we worked hard to make sure that no matter how you manipulate the rig theres always some preservation of their volume if you squish them down they automatically widen their arms shift around and its all kind of automated so an animator doesnt have to worry about it i worked with our rigger on thatso far it looks like all their design work paid off these creatures draw you in with their wide eyes innocent looks and inviting smiles from your first encounter the scene is set youre going to fall in love this first rot that you collect is kind of unique and kind of ends up being the leader of the group josh says he kind of rests on kenas shoulder as shes running around and they have a special connection hes always going to be pointing out things for kena to do throughout the game so hes a really helpful character and is kind of our character embodiment of the whole group of rot because all the rest of the rot look similar except for size differences so we really wanted to put some personality on himthe team has also worked to put in quiet little moments where you can just bond with them theres no affection system or anything but its there to just take in their adorable presence every so often my angle on the rot has mostly been focused on charm and trying to make sure that you have moments where theyre so cute and i want to cry says designer liz fiacco laughing ive been trying to seek moments like that where you can build a little relationship and its kind of fluffy but hopefully memorable its mostly about trying to give the opportunity for the player to express what they feel toward characters in the game whats nice about slow moments is that it allows you to have the same space as these characters some of these tender occasions include having the rot gather around kena if she sits or if she directs them to go somewhere watching them do cute hops to their destinationand if that wasnt enough for you can unlock hats for your rot with gems you find in the world this is purely a cosmetic thing but who doesnt want to put a pumpkintopper or fisherman hat on these furry friends well be

of the galaxy was revealed by eidosmontral and square enix in june the trailer made it clear the development team was forging its own path with the story character design and gameplay however certain elements of the tone many fans know and love from the marvel cinematic universe films are present including the action humorand perhaps most importantly the way licensed music from the past permeates the experienceas players blast their way through the cosmos they can expect to hear a fully orchestrated soundtrack the recording happened at the famed abbey road studios in london england with inspiration drawn from john williams scores in the star wars movies the notion was to create an accompaniment akinto what you hear ina popcornstyle actionadventure moviewhile every track we heard during our gameplay demo was fitting for the action on screen the licensed tracks are simultaneously showstealing attention grabbers and perfect complements to the action senior audio director steve szczepkowski was largely responsible for the licensed tracks appearing in the game just as peter quill aka starlord makes his own mixtapes in the marvel universeszczepkowski was essentially able to do the same for marvel guardians of the galaxy with a few caveatsas much as it was fun it was actually quite challenging to try and limit myself to only a set amount of songs and be like are the right songs he says even then just because i want the song doesn mean there going to be a fit for the artist for whatever reason they might not want to be involved in any games or they might not want to license their stuff so there was a lot of factors into thatunlike the mcu films where peter is constantly popping in cassette tapes featuring the biggest hits of the in marvel guardians of the galaxy his musical taste skews more towards the big hits of the one of the mandates we were asked by marvel was to make it a unique standalone experienceszczepkowski says what we did right away is decided to go if peter grew up in the here a decade that rich andit a lot more familiar for our audience than the it a bit closer the licensed music and everything you going to experience for that in the game is definitely wrapped up in the the processszczepkowski used for selecting the music that appears in the game which ranges from iron maiden to rick astley was bouncing ideas off of senior creative director jeanfranois dugas dugas veers more into the heavy metal acts from the where asszczepkowski was raised on a steady diet of hard rock and new wave whileszczepkowski acknowledges that he could have very easily thrown together a playlist of his favorite rock groups from the in a few minutes he understands the need for mass appealwithout revealing too much i even went after one or two earworms those songs that when you would hear on the radio would stick in your head for three hours after and you catch yourself thinking it and want to punch yourself in the head for whatever reason you like am i singing this songwhile much of the musical implementation both licensed and orchestrated is done organicallyszczepkowski alludedthat there one scene in particular where they designed the scene around the payoff of the song kicking inszczepkowski worked closely with the team to build properly to that moment so that when the track starts it earned and not jarringin certain instances like that one the right licensed song can make or break a scene and whenszczepkowski knows the song is the right fit he fights for its inclusion it a gut instinct he says i sit down and i try like different tracks and all of a sudden one track just rings for me and regardless of what anybody else says i know from my experience that the right track in that moment and i ready to fall on my sword one way or another for itszczepkowski took on a proactive role in the implementation of licensed tracks often going to other members of the team like dugas and suggesting inserting particular licensed tracksinto scenes prior to the pandemic forcing everyone to work remotelyszczepkowski desk was next tothat of animation director darryl purdy the two would constantly volley ideas back and forth about which scenes should have licensed tracks how they implement them and which track would fit besti can talk about it now but there a moment in our game where we triggered a licensed track for a certain moment and for me it my favorite part of the game purdy says it was the first one that we collaborated on and when we got it we were like yeah okay we nailed the tone of what we wantperhaps the most inyourface way licensed music is used is in special huddle sequences during combat encounters in one instance in the gameplay shown during the game reveal starlord initiates a huddle during a difficult battle which boosts his fellow guardians as a popular song blares over the combat in the instance shown in the reveal gameplay footage joan jett bad reputation was starlord track of choice while the song that plays during these supercharged combat sequences changes the concept is the samethat basically came about from me seeing some artwork from one of the concept artists that had the guardians in almost like a footballstyle huddle from in combatszczepkowski says i thought that really interesting and he was telling me his concept then i went back and was like if one of these things is a power up and what if we tried playing licensed music over the combat but not all the time obviously because anything that cool you overdo it and it stops being cool really fastthe team settled on having the huddle mechanic be almost a reward and celebration of sorts for players the huddle concept layers on top of the core combat to create extra special sequences featuring massive hits that inject an extra punch to encounters moments like that exemplify exactly the kind of musical dna that is intertwined with the foundation of guardians of the galaxy at this pointas those who have streamed or posted playthroughs of games that use licensed music can attest recognizable tracks not created for the sole purpose of the video game they featured in can be a nightmare of dmca strikes thankfully marvel guardians of the galaxy includes a streaming mode which disables all licensed music and allows for streamers to broadcast and archive their streams worryfreemarvel guardians of the

on game informers cover this month as part of our rpg issue in it we go indepth about our handson time with tales of arise and talk to members of the development team about what to expect from this reinvention of the longrunning rpg franchise if the issue hasnt shown up at your door yet fret not today were providing a breakdown about what really caught our eye and impressed us as we played through the games entire first chapter that september release date is just around the corner so here a taste of what looking the most promisingtales of arise opens by introducing you to two very different worldsand how they intersect rena and dahna the technologically advanced rena has ruled over dahna for the past years but it wasnt always that way the two once coexisted with rena regarded as a paradise and domain for the gods while the lush dahna was once believed to be indestructible and everlasting then rena proved that untrue using its superior technology to wreak havoc and nearly obliterate dahna in an instant the lands beauty was stripped with rena depleting its natural resources and forcing its inhabitants into slaverywhen rena conquered dahna its leaders split the land into five distinct realms giving each leader a chance to rule how they saw fit tales of arises first chapter focuses on orbus calaglia which is governed by a tyrant named balseph the lord of the fire master core hes about as big and fiery as youd expect in appearance and the barren wasteland he commands is full of scorched terrain oppressive heat and dust stormscommon themes in previous tales games include nature and coexistence touching on racism loss and societal decline however arises opening is a brutal and frightening look at what happens when power and greed get out of hand as you watch the dahnan people suffer as slaves under the ruthless oppression of the renan soldiers while we learn the basics about these two worlds its clear theres a complicated history here and that something needs to change to ensure a better future for all bandai namco keeps a lot under wraps for you to uncover about these two different lands and i liked feeling like i was constantly piecing together the truththe two characters at the center of this adventure are alphen and shionne and they could not be more different alphen is from dahna spending his daysas a slave answering to rena soliders harsh demands he has a strong sense of justice as depicted in an early scene where he steps in front of a lashing meant for a child not performing up to expectations this encounter is also where we learn he cant feel painshionnes backstory is a bit more complicated and she keeps her cards close to her chest about her upbringing and current situation where alphen cant feel pain shionne can only cause it she has a curse where anybody who touches her gets engulfed in thorns that electrocute them shionne is also from rena but based on her being on the run it clear she not in good standing thereher curse and checkeredpast have left herguarded and shes quick to give alphen a hard time whenever she can their relationship is full of banter and putting each other in their places a bit akin to aybss luke and tear but their opposite lifestyles also bring out different sides of the current turmoil unfolding between the two worldsi loved watching this dynamic as you not only learn about the world through their different viewpoints but you also see both characters come to understand one another and grow throughout the story characters and beliefs will be tested and it will be interesting to see how alphen and shionne change throughout the adventurehow you learn new skills has been altered to offer more customization over your characters better yet the new system implements the legacy titles feature titles names that can be assigned to your characters once unlocked by certain game events have been a part of the series from the beginning first appearing in tales of phantasia on the snes since then theyve been used in different ways throughout the series such as providing special effects or abilities to party members when equippedtheyre becoming much more meaningful in tales of arise by getting tied directly into the progression system titles like escape artist or speedy chef open access to new abilities and stat boosts for characters which you unlock by investing the skill points you earn and leveling up every ability costs a certain amount of skill points giving you options like gaining new arteslike sonic thrust speeding up the charge on a special attack or ko prevention every title has five different abilities associated with it and you get a bonus stat boost for unlocking all abilities within one you can swap between various titles or focus on one at a timethis portion of the game is really designed so that the player can have some freedom in making their own decisions director hirokazu kagawa told us maybe theyll have a difficult time deciding okay whats more optimal whats good where should i focus and thats exactly the process that we want people to go through whatever choice that they make its designed so that it can fit various play styles you can really fit it to your liking and still be successfulas someone who loves to build characters this system has me excited for the customization potential i stopped at the screen many times contemplating if i should save up my sp for ko prevention so i could withstand a deadly attack or if i should get access to more artes to have better combo options i even wondered if i should be focusing on just one title to get the stat bonus but i kept being swayed by the variety of mixing and matching from a slew of different ones this system has a lot of potential but time will tell how farreaching and satisfying it is as with many other elements bandai namco is trying new things and they seem like intelligent innovationsa big strength of the tales series is its relationshipbuilding between the party members bandai namco isnt dialing this back in the slightest in fact the development team designs theworld map with the characters and places for them to interact in mind the center of everything in the worldmap design is always the character building and revealing more to the player about the character whether thats dialogue actions or different activities so we always make sure that we can portray the character by building the world around themproducer yusuke tomizawa told uspointing to various scenic points you can find in the game where characters will react to your actions and the places youre goingthe series ultimate bonding moments which fans best know as skits also are returning but theyregetting an upgrade skits are no longer just character portraits with dialogue boxes now they feature models in comicbook style interactions akin to what we saw in bandai namcos recent actionrpg scarlet nexus the cartoony feel of skitsisgone making them feel much more immersiveim glad to see the emphasis on character interactions hasnt diminished if anything it looks like bandai namco has only added in more moments for dialogue between the party in fact even in dungeons kagawa said to expect more banter and interactions between characters that add comedic reliefthe first chapter takes you to a few different dungeons but theyre mostly smaller affairs however the final dungeon in the first chapter is called glanymede castle and its a vast structure that represents the fiery region and the style of its ruthless leader balseph youre basically running up a colossal tower trying to locate a key to switch the elevators back on howeverbandai namco added some interesting conundrumsto keep things interestingblazing walls block certain places and you can spend cp to melt the flames this choice creates an interesting dilemma do you spend the cp to find better items and equipment or conserve it since using cp means draining yourhealing resourceskagawa says not every dungeon makes you choose between using cp but a good portion will the idea behind the cp resource is that we really want to make the player think about their choices and formulate strategies kagawa said coming up with a game plan is something that we believe is a very enjoyable and satisfying experience were making the player put their choices on a pendulum or scale are you going to use the cp for battle and survivability or are you going to use it more for exploration and item findingi liked this feature as the risk and reward part made exploration more enticing time will tell if it wears out its welcome after a few dungeons but i liked having some extra decisions to make in how thorough i wanted to explore this also got me thinking of what else dungeons will offer to make them memorable beyond the boss fights leading me to ask about puzzlesdungeons in the tales games have usually had some form of puzzles whether you moving boxes or tapping switches in a particular order but recent entries have dialed back on those elements when i asked about puzzles kagawa had an interesting answer there will be some puzzle elements that might be familiar to you if you played the past entries he said but we did want to make sure that these puzzles didnt feel out of place within the overall context of the world and so we really were careful in designing these puzzles to make sure that they feel realistic and believable and that theyre not completely removed or feel foreign to the world kagawa also confirmed that since tales of arises characters can swim and jump the team also incorporated that into some of the puzzlesolving elements of dungeons color me intriguedwant to see the game in action check out our latest new

Martin May Be Shocked To See What His Elden Ring Characters Have Become,legendary writer george rr martin collaborated with from software and hidetaka miyazaki to essentially create the mythology of the world of elden ring before the catastrophic shattering event the characters involved were often crafted as humans heroic but flawed in their journeys and adventures however as from software took on the task of converting these characters to entities that would fit into elden ring these mythic heroes and personalities got broken down into something twisted and more suited to occupying a boss monster rolewhen martin wrote these characters and when he provided that origin story that mythos for the world of elden ring these demigods were much closer to their original form and maybe closer to human form back then before the shattering before it all started so it was more up to us to interpret this and say how did they become such inhuman monsters and how did the mad taint of the shattered shards of the elden ring and its power affect them so that was our job to take these grand heroes and sort of misshape them and distort them into something they were not says game director hidetaka miyazaki and i think if we get a chance to show martin and if he gets a chance to see the game and see these characters i think he might be a bit shocked when he wrote them he was really envisioning something a little bit more human a little bit more traditional human drama and fantasy characters so i hope he gets a kick out of thatmiyazakis favorite martin character in the game a mysterious figure named rykard we dont have any other information on this personality right now other than the name but theyll probably be quite a doozythat process of taking these very human characters with flaws but these very dramatic heroic characters and basically breaking them and making them these misshapen grotesque monsters that was a lot of fun for me personallysome of martins characters combined with that signature from bosscrafting technique that has given us elegant executioners like sister friede and titanic monstrosities like darkeater midir is a recipe for greatnessi have a feeling that the most epic boss encounters in from softwares suite are going to have some stiff competition when elden ring arrives,en,206.0,Positive
gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/31/io-interactive-on-walking-away-from-the-hitman-series,IO Interactive On Walking Away From The Hitman Series,at this point in the studio history the hitman series has been with io interactive longer than anyone working in its office no one at the company has worked on every single entry in the franchise for years the name io has been synonymous with hitman and its protagonist agent while the developer has made other games such as the kane lynch freedom fighters and mini ninjas games the vast majority of its releases have been hitman games but hitman is the end of an era capping off the world of assassination trilogy it started in with its episodic hitman reboot io is walking away from its most iconic franchise at least for the time being and there are a lot of emotions tied up in that factin a lot of ways the story of hitman is the story of io interactive especially considering the company last few years always a niche cult series when hitman didn make the return io thenpublisher and parent company square enix wanted as ceo and coowner hakan abrak puts it the company lost faith in the franchise though admittedly he seems to understand square decisionit was called a trojan horse strategy just get people in and if they like it they will upgrade abrak says maybe well get a whole lot bigger volumes in the start and hopefully we can convert these people if they like the game that was the strategy the skepticism and what is this and is this early access from a big publisher and whatnot it ended up being historically low sales a historically low startand over time even our publisher and owner back then lost faith he saysin may square enix announced it was selling io interactive as part of a restructuring of resources and energies on key franchises and studios rather than wait to be purchased by a new company io negotiated a management buyout with square announcing in june that it was for the first time in its history a fully independent developer and that it would retain the rights to the hitman intellectual property ip we have a more detailed story on io as an independent studio on the website in coming weeksit was io faith in the hitman series and itself as a developer that has shepherded them both to success postbuyout according to io coowner and chief creative officer christian elverdam between hitman and thanks to more than weekly and monthly updates the games have gone on to reach more than million playershitman is the companys first release as an independent studio but its also ios last hitman game for a while it marks the end of this chapter of agent story and the end of this chapter of ios historyi think im going to cry when its done hitman game director mattias engstrm says its been a ride and a joy to work on this for this longi think for me the nostalgia is not so much about the game being done because it will live and it will be live and people will play it executive producer forest swartout large adds its more about the privilege of getting to make the third iteration with this group of extremely talented really excellent people who just care so much about their jobs i dont know if it will ever get better than thisin november io announced it was working with the james bond license on a game specifically focused on bond origin story project as its currently called is the first publicly known nonhitman game io has worked on since kane lynch dog days launched in and its first new ip as an independent studio even though its done other ip in the past abrak and elverdam both recognize their company is seen as the hitman studio a game like project is a way to move beyond that they sayhitman and io interactive are very very closely knit obviously abrak says but i think moving forward io should not necessarily be mentioned as the hitman studio io interactive but first and foremost people should think about io interactive as io interactive first creators of different ips and a place of creativity where hitman is definitely one of our children but there are going to be more children in the future and one of them is you think about the future of hitman as well if you think about the future of the bond franchise were in a place where we feel curious and hungry creatively elverdam adds if you think about what would bond be what would hitman be in the future hopefully youll think hey these guys certainly seem like they are interested in trying to take the games new placeselverdam pushes back on the idea that io is leaving hitman behind in fact he says it not the end of the hitman ip at all as he points out the recent run of hitman games which started in with the hitman reboot was always billed as a trilogy hitman as the name would imply is the conclusion of that part of agent story there no real reason to think io won return to hitman in the future it perfectly reasonable to think the studio will given how iconic the series is for io but given what the developer has gone through in recent years walking away from hitman for the time being closing this chapter of agent story with hitman feels fitting elverdam saysin a way i think its poetic that hitman in its prime in a way was the beginning for io as an independent company elverdam says right now its also the beginning of io as an independent company because the first title that we launch is the ending of this conclusion and that feels super good to be honest i think the world of the assassination trilogy because it will be a whole when you look at it i think its super strong im super proud of it im super proud of what we achieved that this is the first thing that we launch makes me feel really good and really comfortable about the future,en,371.0,Positive

So Long In Tackling A Remaster,many mass effect fans have been clamoring for a remaster for years now including our own joe juba while not everyone felt the need to revisit the normandy once more the aging of the first game and the desire to play the full trilogy on current generations have given passionate players a reason to cling to hope every day now that we got a release date for the upcoming remaster with the mass effect legendary edition we spoke with bioware to learn the history of the decision behind the nostalgic throwbackas part of our monthlong celebration of mass effect as a part of our cover story this month we sat down with project director mac walters and characterenvironment director kevin meek to learn more about our journey back into space as commander shepardwe just really excited to finally start talking about this walters tells us talk of the remaster started to ramp upnot long after mass effect andromeda but the conversation itself has been ongoing for yearsespecially with each passing dayafandriven holiday celebrating the series on november and modeled after the military designation ingamewe always been keen to do it i think you know when we finished the trilogy we started to think about what next but it was by all accounts just a passion project the team that worked on the original trilogy was a tightknit group according to walters while some developers have since left the company a few more have returned for the future of the franchise that this remaster will help set upwith the conversation perculating for several years why was now the time pursue this venture wholly when we started talking about the remaster again it was almost two years ago when casey hudson returned and we were talking about what mass effect had been and if now was the time the starsreally just aligned around so many different things and we finally got the momentum that we had been trying to build up and put forward a plant to create what is now called the legendary editiononce the project became a reality the work was immediate under the code name deloreon afterback to the futurethe remaster began to take on a life of its own it one of the few projects i been on that leapt almost straight into production phase walters addsbefore production began and when the team had the muchdesired greenlight the questions about the next step began in earnest questions like how do we do this how deep do we want to go do we do a remaster or go allout for a remake while a remake was talked about bioware ultimately decided that to do so risks losing what enthralled so many players withthe original trilogy they didn want tochangethe trilogy they wanted to bring it into a new generation for veterans and newcomersalikemeek adds one thing that really helped focus us was looking at the way fans talked about shepard they call it shepard and they very possessive about their shepard in a really good strong way that doesn just mean the character that means every shepard story their shepard narrative it all the choices they made along the way so very early on we realized that if the choices the narrative the plot points are what everyone loves and holds on to then changing that is off the table we not going to change any of those things we not going to change the story we not going to change the characters and that what really sort of pushed us more in terms of a proper remasteryou can learn more about the decision to do a remaster instead of a remake with our full interview right herewhile at first glance some of the nuance of the remaster can be lost we did do a deeper dive into what changes players can expect with our earlier breakdown here it more than just lens flare effects and higher contrast the remaster will have more character customization options so that players can create a shepard that theyfeel comfortable with the iconic mass effect femshep model is finallyavailable across all three games over dlc have beenincluded so that no one has to miss out on vital story additions like the creators of the reapers and liara aggressive pull to become the next shadowbroker there are so many instances where fresh life is breathed into this remaster without changing what it feels like yes we even addressed the misconception revolving around a small scene where miranda derier took center stage when fighting for her sister lifefrom timing to resources there were a lot of factors that kept the legendary edition as just a passion project idea but now that it is officially on the way longtime fans can excitedly await

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/05/why-mass-effect-legendary-edition-is-a-remaster-not-a-remake,Why Mass Effect Legendary Edition Is A Remaster (Not A Remake),theres been much excitement surrounding mass effect legendary edition so much so we even put it on the cover of our most recent issue biowares remaster of the famed commander shepard trilogy is coming out may and while fans have certainly pined for this remaster one question that keeps coming up iswhy not a remake its a valid question especially since many series like resident evil and final fantasy have instead opted to remake beloved games to appeal more to modern audiences however bioware didnt feel like that was the right approach for the trilogy at this point in time in fact making it a remaster in the true sense was one thing the team agreed upon early on before they even really got goingbioware started talking about finding a way to preserve commander shepards story shortly after it finished mass effect andromeda every year a small team investigated what it would take figuring out logistics and determining exactly what avenue would be best for it the team always leaned more toward a remaster as they envisioned this undertaking however once they finally got everything greenlit the team also wanted to approach it with what project director mac walters calls fresh thinking this led them to ponder once again what it would take to create a remake or make largescale changes leading them down the path of considering upgrading engineswe didn want to get stuck in the way we had thought about it originally walters explains and so we did open sort of the pandora box of what if this was a remake we actually sat down with a team from epic and talked to them about unreal and said what would it take if we were going to upgrade this and work on it what we quickly realized was that aside from the complexity the cost and all of those things the trilogy really would have lost the essence of what it waswalters used the example of kismet the unreal visual scripting language not being able to carry over as a dealbreaker there no way to take that scripting and just automatically have it work in the unreal engine so that means youre rescripting scenes combats the way levels work the way our uis work all of that would have to be redone inherently it would lose just the essence of what mass effect was not to mention just the way it renders and everything else as well and so ultimately we decided that unreal engine was probably going to be the best version to keep it feeling like what it was but also provide an opportunity to uplift it as wellbioware wanted to retain what made shepards story special providing a nostalgic experience that wouldnt deviate from players fond memories of the series for a remake i do feel like we would have found ourselves chasing our tails to find the magic walters says if we had just said we leveling everything and we just going to try to recreate that from scratch you can it was about the people it was about so much of the intangibles not just the tech and everything else that brought that together it was a beloved franchise highly rated i dont think you mess with thatafter toying with different ways to approach bringing back the trilogy it was a fairly quick consensus that a remaster was the way to go it was important to have something that stayed true to what made people fall in love with the series and bioware didnt want to make any big changes to the core content that might jeopardize thatthis is a beloved franchise walters says if you look at the way fans talk about shepard they say my shepard right they very possessive about shepard in a really good really strong way and of course that doesn just mean the character shepard that means that shepards story it all the choices that are made along the way and so very early on we realized look if the choices and the plot points if we gonna say that those are what everyone loves holds on to and wants to call it their own in the sense of their memory of this a remake is off the table we not changing any of those things that really pushed us more in the direction of just a proper remaster where it like i love this game and i want to experience it all again but id really love to play it on my current and future hardware and i like to see it brought up to today standards and environment directorkevin meek who has spent the last five years at bioware working on games such as anthem came onto the project as a fan of the trilogy and said it was a difficult process of getting the balance right it was like a ship of theseus type thing of how far can you change this before it not the same as it was meek asks in a remake you start off with some line in the sand like this is not the same ship that it used to be whereas in a remaster it the same toolset the same level the same characters just polished up that where i get that nostalgia factor and i would have definitely lost a lot of that if we gone the other waythats not to say the improvements for the remaster are just in the visuals bioware spent time taking into account fan feedback to refine as much as possible this means improvements to the mako faster load times in those pesky elevators transforming barren levels into more striking locales and having a unified control scheme and hud throughout the trilogy and thats only some of the additions and enhancementshowever it goes without saying mass effect legendary edition isnt going to fundamentally change or redefine how you experience shepards story and thats okay as a longtime fan meek said it best for me its that sense of nostalgia i still vividly remember the feeling i still even get it sometimes now when opening the presidium in mass effect in unreal and flying around like that is the presidium from mass effect that i played and loved back in the day and if i remade that even using

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/24/5-things-you-should-know-about-hitman-3,5 Things You Should Know About Hitman 3,hitman release is drawing close and with it comes the end of an era for agent and io interactive we took an extensive look at the final entry in the world of assassination trilogy for our latest game informer cover story spending hours in three of the games six levels theres a lot to process so lets get right into it here are five things that you should know about hitman my clunky star wars analogy but i feel like its an apt comparison agent diana burnwood lucas gray and others have been through a lot throughout the hitman series with several key relationships extending even beyond the release after rolling credits on hitman you probably thought that things were going to be coming to a head in hitman and youre right obviously since its the concluding entry in the trilogy we were all expecting some major events but even still i suspect a lot of fans are going to be taken aback at what happenslike i said i was only able to play through about half of the upcoming game but it ends in such a way that i really dont know where its heading ive been sworn to secrecy on much of this which makes it extremely difficult to discuss but yeah hitman exists in a world thats at once familiar and completely foreign i cant imagine how anyone involved is going to find peace at the end of this if you just play hitman to throw muffins at guards and drown oligarchs in toilets then it may not be that big of a deal but id imagine those other players myself included will be spending about half the games run time with their stomachs tied in knotsfor my money the hitman trilogy is home to some of the best allaround level design in games each of its sandboxes tells multiple stories thanks to smartly executed layouts that encourage emergent storytelling and an overall focus on the little details that matter levels are meant to be replayed over and over again before they fully give up their secrets and im honestly in awe that io interactive is able to deftly encourage that without becoming repetitive that tradition definitely continues in hitman games first mission set in dubai is a bombastic intro worthy of a mission impossible film its set in the sceptre which is the tallest skyscraper in hitmans world and agent gets to explore both its lavishly decorated interior and dizzying exterior even as someone who isnt particularly sensitive to heights snaking around its outside via beams and scaffolding made me a little woozy at timesits a stark contrast to the second mission a murder mystery thats set in an english manor one that happens to be owned by providence member alexa carlisle the layout is already great capturing the essence of both the english countryside and a stately family home the level is more compact than some of the places weve explored from a purely squarefootage perspective but its home to an expansive story in this mission one of the optional storylines lets agent assume the role of a private investigator who is trying to solve a murder agent has pretended to be a barber and a realestate agent in previous games but this is his most ambitious attempt at putting himself in someone elses shoes to solve the mystery players will have to interrogate witnesses look for clues and piece together what actually happened or you could just walk up to your target and shoot her in the face that kind of misses the point howeverwhen youre able to dispatch enemies with weapons as varied as rubber duckies poison and sniper rifles theres not really much of an incentive to add to your toolbox well too bad hitman gives agent a new tool as well as some interesting additional options while hes in the fieldone of the first things you do in dubai is to scan a security keypad with a camera so that your field support can open it up for you thats right agent has a camera that tool not only lets him scan keypads but he can use it to send visual info to his handlers such as when hes investigating the murder in england or he can use it as a camera including different visual filters and zoom levels its a great way to check out those little details that might otherwise pass you by and since the trilogy has been designed to be played seamlessly the camera will be incorporated into legacy hitman and missions tooafter getting passcodes players will have to enter them digit by digit on keypads which is a new detail for the hitman games its not a worldchanging event by any means but it does make agent feel like more of an active participant in his surroundings similarly he can interact with computer terminals such as using a kiosk in dubais skyscraper to learn more about its construction and more relevantly its floorplanio interactive took a big risk with its world of assassination plan starting with hitman game it was conceived as an umbrella under which several hitman entries would reside as new installments were added they could be accessed with the same executable giving players who bought all three a seamless experience between all entries it didnt start smoothly howeverpeople were skeptical about the plan at launch and publisher square enix wasnt quite as keen on the idea as much as io interactive was add in the fact that hitman launched as a series of monthly episodes and it makes sense that customers were a little wary now that hitman is just about here im able to say that the studio has absolutely delivered the goodsi replayed the first two hitman games in preparation for the story and slid right into the third one of the coolest things about the experience is how youre able to bounce between levels at will if you play through sequentially its a seamless experience as io interactive added new things like foliage that agent could hide in or better visual cues for surveillance cameras the team went in and implemented those changes into the legacy missionsyes hitman on newgen consoles will have fancy lighting and reflections and all that good stuff but the most welcome improvement at least as i see it comes courtesy of the and xbox series xs ssds thanks to their faster readwrite speeds the act of saving and loading games is much quicker than on lastgen so well if youre an unrepentant save scummer like i am it makes a differencewhen i play hitman im always pushing my luck seeing just how far i can manipulate guards and other ai as i explore and take down targets can i neutralize that guard even though his coworker is just a few feet around the corner save lets see what would happen if i threw a hammer at that guy save lets see those guys cant possibly know that im not supposed to be here right save lets see i know there are plenty of people who love to live with the consequences of their actions im not among them and now ill save more than my progressand before you judge mattias engstrom hitman game director gives the green light to my fellow save scummers thats part of the gameplay so dont apologize he told me then again maybe he was just trying to make me feel better oh

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/05/05/looking-into-groundeds-unnatural-wonders,Looking Into Grounded’s Unnatural Wonders,a backyard can be atreacherous place to explore when youre shrunken down to a centimeter thats the central conceit behind grounded the upcoming survival game from obsidian entertainment danger may be a constant companion but we were struck by something else during our hours of handson time the backyard isa really fun place to exploreit definitely feels like the one thing we talk about is making it feel like a theme park says game director adam brennecke one thing were trying to do is make it feel like every turn and everywhere you go theres something cool to find not only the stuff materials wise but there might be a cool manmade object or a little secret cave that youve never seen beforetheyre definitely on the right track head out in any random direction and youeventually stumble upon an object thats fun interesting or flatout weird and even though we still didnt understand why for instance theres a disembodied actionfigure head out in the middle of nowhere the developers have spent a lot of time poring over its back storytheres an object in the world why is it there who put it there who made this where is it manufactured brennecke says going through just some of the details his team sweats what is the company that makes this where can you buy it and thats just for manmade objects i think thats what makes obsidian games so great we care about the games so much and we talk about this stuff probably way more than we should and i think those details come through even as a developer i love obsidian games because we spend so much time on that stuffcreating props at this scale took some adjusting too it took us a little bit to figure out how to even make things this largesays lead environment artist sean dunnyif you think about large objects in a traditionally scaled video game you think about a building which is made up of a bunch of different composite parts so each of these pieces can be done separately and then made to look the way you want but when you have somethingthe size of a building but is all one cohesive seamless material it becomes a little bit trickier so weve had to create some custom materials and shaders to give us that upclose detail that we want while also maintaining a read from far awaygroundeds overall visual presentation is a departure from a lot of survival games too its world is bright and cheery looking even the spiders as creepy and dangerous as they are are stylize to a point where they almost look kind of cute that overall aesthetic is at its peak in the graphic design for many of the various manmade objects within the game the products you come across have bold and purposefully awkward designs with logos and branding that lean into groundeds setting the team credits senior artist mitch loidolt with much of that aesthetic he even created a document titled why the are a cool time period to set a game which highlighted some of the visual touchstones that they could lean on i didnt want to be mocking it in any way loidolt says i didnt want it to be super out there and blast your face with the just to bring you back to that time is allafter seeing some of the manmade objects in the world and hearing about all the work that went into their creation we wanted to learn more here are some super esoteric stories behind a few of the objects that youll encounter early on in groundedat groundeds scale an ordinarily unassuming juice box becomes an imposing landmark the rectangular object is immediately recognizable with a bent straw jutting out of one end and dribbling juice onto the ground dunny says making props for grounded has been significantly different from his work on fallout new vegas for example since small details are scaled up its important that objects feel authentic im actually looking up diagrams of how juice boxes are folded together and the manufacturing process to get that sort of thing right he saysthe juice box we actually have a corporation called puncho that makes those juice boxes brennecke says theyre a part of a large company that has their hands in lots of different things which is called mouthtown the puncho brand is very similar to hic for example mitch made his own almost storyline of all the characters on the puncho boxes for example we have lemon crime which is the lemonlime drinki like armed raspberry loidolt adds its the juicestice squad they fight the bad fruitspart of the backyard is walled off by a thick hedge getting up it may seem impossible until you notice something familiar sticking out of the vegetation one item that i particularly like is the frisbee because i love frisbee in general says art director kaz aruga that thing came out of personal experience we used to have this tall hedge next to our office and we used to chuck them and theyd always get stuck in the hedge so i like that little detail in the yard that thing the way its wedged in it actually serves as a little platform in the hedge biome you can have a little boss fight with a spider thereone of the first things you might run into that sells groundeds sense of scale is an otherwise ordinary baseball its massive unlike the juice box which releases lifesustaining juice from its straw the ball doesnt serve any gameplay purpose instead its a landmark thats close to a fairly large clearing when youre still getting your bearings landmarks like these are vital i tend to build near the baseball because its a very flat open area and i like building massive megastructures dunny sayswhen i first came across it i circled the ball and soaked up all the detail everything from the grain of the leather to the stitching has been carefully reconstructed theres also a cartoon face on it was there a little story there as it turns out there isi think the little cartoon character that mitch drew is our feargus face brennecke says referring to obsidian cofounder and studio head feargus urquhart we call it chunky chubs baseball which is the branding for the baseball equipment that we have in the yardwas that something that loidolt cleared ahead of time its a bad habit of mine trying to reduce peoples faces to the easiest drawing that i can think ofhe says its definitely an ask forgiveness situationsoda cans are scattered throughout the yard possible evidence of the jerk teens that loidolt says throw their trash from a nearby gas station the best part of the cans is that you can crawl into them and build a small base completely protected from spiders and some of the other large pests in the yard getting in used to be even easier toowhen i first started making the mesh for the soda can i got a message from mitch a couple of days later and it was like hey this is incorrect you have a widemouth soda can and those didnt exist at the time dunny says so i had to actually modify the mesh to fit with the time period of our game its certain things like that where you have to take into account not just how the thing is actually made but how it was made in the early also made jabby cola which is my face and my nickname brennecke adds if you see jabby cola thats me which is great im on a soda can nowone of the stranger objects in the yard is the head of an action figure and the body is nowhere to be seen theres not much to go on since it is just a head but obsidian has bigger plans for the toywe actually have our own cartoon universe that were making brennecke says its inspired by heman but they obviously couldnt just lift that licensed character instead they put their own spin on the character his name is yokedgirth hes just like pure muscle hes like a lot of the action heroes from that period smashed all into one character were also developing a toy line and a comic book theres also a chance that players will run into toys based on their skeletor analogthe team was happy to talk about the minutiae behind many of groundeds landmarks but only to a certain point there were plenty of times where they held back a bit wanting to keep some of it a mysteryone of the things that i really love about this style of game is the discussion it brings about dunny says i love reading fan theories about games that i like even seeing a wikipedia page or a gamepedia and seeing people piece together these things by leaving less of it explicitly said one of the things that im personally interested in is fostering that kind of discussion and encouraging that kind of community

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/12/29/bringing-hitman-to-vr,Bringing Hitman To VR,when it comes to hitman vr io interactive owes a lot to the game firewall zero hour the playstation vr game from first contact entertainmentas eksil mhl a senior game designer at io tells it the studio interest in vr started two years ago with his coworker oliver winding a senior writer at the company one day winding approached mhl asking him to come over he wanted mhl to try out his new playstation vr mhl was taken with the system going out and buying his own as a christmas present to himself and that when he played firewall like winding mhl wanted to show off the playstation vr headset he took it to the io office showing his coworkers and having them play firewall as luck would have it people at io interactive shared his enthusiasm including lead game designer sidsel hermansen who recalls that people at the office couldnt stop playingwe just had to play play play hermansen saysthis past august io announced it was bringing the world of assassination trilogy to the playstation vr updating the first two games hitman and to support the technology as well as developing the upcoming hitman with vr in mind according to mhl and hermansen it was the excitement the studio had over games like firewall that led the team to making its own vr mode for hitmanwithin io the hitman vr team is small only or people plus qa it a low headcount especially considering three games worth of content is being updated to support an entirely new way of play but io isn building a new game from the ground up it updating existing software one of the surprising things the team found when beginning its work on hitman vr was even though none of the previous games were made with vr in mind the levels that were built naturally lent themselves to the new perspectiveits environment art its the character art its sound design sound design i get goosebumps just thinking about it the sound design is so fing beautiful hermansen says the ai even the systemics as well it just worksand we found s like one of the levels has to pick up this usb stick its an intel item something you pick up and you just go bloop the prompt is like this big mohl adds gesturing the size of a thumb drive so in vr you can go in and actually look at it like this he puts his face close to the table he sitting at and some weird guy or girl has made the most insane usb stick like the little light on it and a little wrapper around it thats sort of dirty it almost had fingerprints on itanother thing mhl brings up are the guns in hitman when they started working with vr they assumed they need to go in and add holodot sights for aiming in first person despite the fact hitman games are in thirdperson whichever artist modeled those guns had already done that for themthe hitman games are already to some extent about roleplay players can choose how they want to assassinate their targets down to what outfits agent wears and what items he uses bringing these games into vr amplifies this it brings out people personalities hermansen says some people will play super cautiously others will take every opportunity to mess with the world and bother npcsif youve played miami in hitman theres an underpass with a guy playing the drums hermansen says and hes like a street musician and there was this one day where i was like im going to play around a bit and i realized i could f him up i could pull his hands away i would take his hand up and then she begins mimicking the motion of a hand falling down on a drum there are so many awesome surprises where its like oh this is just in there what the f is going onone thing that is very different in hitman vr is the way it reduces your distance from the game violence by design virtual reality eliminates a lot of separation a player has from what happening on screen effectively tricking your brain into thinking you really in this location doing these things the hitman games can be brutal there are ways to kill people that are extremely violent it something the team says it thought about during the making of hitman vr and while it has changed some kill animations in the game to better fit vr it hasn changed any of the game content that said players may take it upon themselves to make their experience less bloody if hermansen and mhls experiences are anything to go off ofwe have a ton of different faces and stuff but when youre in vr you notice oh its that guy mhl says hes also being used over here and hes also the butcher in hitman level sapienza i remember i had to do something brutal to somebody and kurt was there and i was like all right im going to kill him but he was like heyhey hows your day hermansen repliesyeah then i was like theres no way i can kill him now mhl addsin that way it actually feels more personal the stuff you do hermansen says if you f up if you have to murder some innocent civilian then for me personally i feel pretty bad im not going to do that again like next time im going to do better because its on me to be a good assassin because its so much more personal and intense and it feels like im the one stabbing some poor woman with a knifetalking to the hitman vr team there an infectious excitement behind everything they say in the course of just an hour i went from being not particularly interested inhitman vr to googling how much it cost to buy a playstation vr setup considering hitman is the first game io is releasing since it became an independent studio it easy to get the impression this is a passion project for the small team a labor of love made within a larger companyits always fun to make games oh my god not always thats bulls its also sucky sometimes but i think because us as game designers and them as gameplay coders we like to do new s hermansen says everyone gets super excited the coders also got super excited like we could do this and actually we usually wouldnt go there but aw f we have to do it right so that excitement has really driven us and weve done much more than should be possible on a relatively small team because of the excitement i dont know if that was surprising but its been a beautiful thing,en,458.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/08/why-liaras-changes-in-mass-effect-legendary-edition-are-important-despite-being-small,Why Liara's Changes In Mass Effect Legendary Edition Are Important Despite Being Small,the mass effect legendary edition is a remaster not a remake which means major changes won be seen when bringing the trilogy into this generation that being said tweaks can be felt throughout all three games including smoother rides in the mako better gun mechanics and a whole lot more as we seen in the trailer bioware has made adjustments to the graphics of the game including contrast changes and lighting effects to create a more realistic aesthetic including that of our favorite blueberry liara while her changes may seem minuscule they actually much more meaningful than you might thinkwe sat down with environment and character director kevin meek to explore why those seemingly minute changes matter and what they mean regarding her coming full circle as a characterliara t is an asari researcher that we first meet in mass effect when we first stumbleupon her on the planet therum she excavating a prothean ruin and triggersa trap that encasesher deep within the catacombs in our first meeting with liarashe a wideeyed lover of science and discovery she also a bit naive and that why many felt so attached to her right off the bat she was brilliant kind adaptable andwhether romanced or not was a valued friend that being said she goes through a major metamorphosis throughout the trilogy one that was never really reflected in her demeanorin mass effect she not the steadfast companion that she was in the first game because she never fully joins back up on the normandy in the sequel though she does return in she still fiercely loyal but you notice she changed when commander shepard reunites with the asariin the second game gone is that sweet naivety instead players are faced with a hardened information broker that now apparently says things like either pay me or i flay you alivewith my mind this of course references her biotic powers in the trilogy but it was such a stark contrastwhen comparing her to the liara of oldby the third game she becomes arguably one of the most powerful people in the galaxy and thatthick skin it really shows she still has moments of tenderness and she never forsakes her loyalty to her friends but she different massively different so how does the remaster pay respect to that evolution in a way that the original trilogy didnwhen talking about how each character was brought into the remaster meek mentioned that the team was very careful not to change how these characters look by augmenting their body styles or outfits of choice but there were lighting adjustments and graphical tweaks that aimed at bringing these faces to life in more detail it would have been really easy to just copy paste the era from the third game into mass effect one but liara goes through quite a character arc in liara is just this doeeyed character wearing her medical uniform or whatever but by the time she gets to mass effect three she really powerful confident you know the shadow broker dlc that was huge because of that it would have wrong for us to take her mass effect face and just slap it onhe added these are the kinds of creative decisions that we had to be mindful of right so we not affecting canon sure people can take a mod and make her look however they want but we have to live within the rails of what narratively was her art what might have just been an accident like people might have just gotten better at making art by the time we got to mass effect and obviously the technology leap so she had a bit more detail and a bit more makeup or whatever but those changes those became canon for her and we have to hold true to thatso what different with her exactly the texturization of her face is especially more defined we saw it for ourselves in the reveal trailer but that texturization for her character in particular makes arguably the biggest impact that soft babyfaced exterior stayed throughout the trilogy when it first released with the addition of makeup but there was nothing outward other than an armor change that reflected the metamorphosis the texture tweak gives her face more life more reflection of how she takes in the world around her this makes her evolution throughout all three games feel more natural and more realisticevery time i played through the trilogy which is way more than i like to admit i always thought her arc didn quite match up with her looks that not to say that sweetlooking people can go ham in the most beastmode way possible but there was no difference in expressions nothing that showed that impact beyond the lines she was saying when we change that change is often reflected outwards scowls vs smiles a sharper glint in the eye a smirk that always hidden just beneath the surface but she never had that these texture changes much like with ashley tweaks in the first game with the remaster give her even more life than she had before which is the perfect homage to how strong her character is and what a badass she becomesi joked with director mac walters and meek that she went from yes sir i have your daughter home by to your daughter calls me mommy now from the first game to the third game because she can beruthlessshe complex and now her art can finally reflect that complexityso there you have it be sure to look out for the other subtle changes made to create a more immersive experience when themass

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/15/how-the-outer-worlds-lets-you-play-your-way,How The Outer Worlds Lets You Play Your Way,the outer worlds is full of different possibilities and depending on the choices players make their experiences with the story and gameplay could vary greatly thats a foundational element of the games design codirectors leonard boyarsky and tim cain have been iterating on how to accommodate player choice since their days working together on the original fallout we talked to the duo about why this concept is so important in the outer worlds and the kinds of decisions players can expect during the journeybroadly speaking obsidian wants you to play the outer worlds your own way including everything from the narrative to the gameplay i dont remember how we came to this formula back when we started working on fallout but we just looked at a bunch of games that were out at the time and it didnt seem you were given a lot of options in terms of playing however you wanted to play boyarsky says there was some player choice but it was you can be the good guy this way or you can be the good guy that waywhile the story does have choices and characters at different places along the goodevil spectrum the outer worlds isnt necessarily about picking a moral alignment and sticking to it its not heres the good choice heres the bad one cain says instead its like you could this or this this will cause x this will cause y you decide what you care aboutbut its not always extreme gray areas boyarsky clarifieswhat if the more evil choice has an obviously better outcome cain says what if more people are saved by the evil choice but its evil but the result is better is it a worse choice i dont know if you can solve morality with arithmetic but there are some things in the game where youre like i am not sure if this is badit all boils down to giving players options that allow them to form an entertaining and consistent vision of their character if you want to be noble and avoid working with bad people thats an option if you want to kill everybody well almost you can do that too you can say things that are nice or mean smart or dumb the game will track many different variables regarding your actions so you never know how you might see your choices reflected in a given scenariohowever dont expect your choices in the outer worlds to send your character down completely divergent paths while the context surrounding major beats may change the game is ultimately telling a cohesive story which means all players must eventually confront the same scenarios for example in the first part of the game you need to find a power regulator for your ship all players need to do that to progressbut they dont need to do it the same wayour story structures look like footballs where there are all these points that everybody will pass through cain says with the power regulator for your ship did you work with people did you buy it theres more than one of them out there so which one did you take how did you handle the people who were using it we try to arrange our story by thinking about the points all players are going to pass through but then we try to remember what the context was so that things in the setting change to reflect the choice you madethis may seem familiar to fans of choicedriven experiences but obsidians path through the choke points is one taken less often in other titles those events often serve as a way to reset the action a way for the game to make something uniform happen for all players regardless of their choices to drive the story forward we dont demand that those dramatic points play out in any specific way boyarsky says this is an impactful moment but is it impactful because you did this or this or this we try to take a neutral approach to thatall of this is in addition to the multiple choices you are making on the gameplay front which skills do you invest in how do you prefer to take out your enemies assuming you even want to take them out at all we went into this thinking about hybrids cain says theres a stealth path but theres also a stealthcombat path but what about the stealthtalker hybrid the person who tries to talk and sneak through situations that would be the ultimate pacifist playthroughapart from mixing the standard combatstealthpersuasion archetypes players can also elect to pursue a leadershipfocused playstyle this means that your individual abilities may lean more general but you invest in skills that allow you to leverage your companions talents more effectively you might do one encounter stealthily and then by changing who you have with you bypass the next potential encounter with persuasion this allows you maximum flexibility though you also lose out on the benefits that may come from maximizing a particular approach thats okay theres no optimal way to play the outer worlds to play it correctly you just need to figure out what is interesting and fun to you and then invest in thatback even before i was working in games when i first started considering what a computer game could be playing text games it just felt like there was this rich world where you could do anything boyarsky says from back when i was young i was like oh thats what a video game should be so i guess ive never lost that crazy ideafor

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/18/the-wonderfully-weird-fiction-of-control,The Wonderfully Weird Fiction Of Control,control is set in an evershifting environment rife with mysteries which makes it a fascinating backdrop for a story storytelling is far from a new beast for remedy who have dabbled in intertwining different mediums like tv into interactive tales during our cover story trip the team went indepth with us about how they are approaching story this time by breaking the fourth wall building a david lynchstyle world with questions that dont always have answers and finding new ways to explore transmedia approaches while also taking reasonable steps back in comparison to quantum breakremedy considers control to be part of the new weird genre a take on science fiction and fantasy that contradicts conventions putting emphasis on the bizarre according to narrative designer brooke maggs the team took inspiration from jeff vandermeers novel annihilation as well as mr robot inception and legion maggs explains that voiceover narration for protagonist jesse plays a big role in control just like it did in max payne but things are a bit different this timeit less of a selfnarration and more what going on in her mind like what she thinking to herself maggs says weve tried to cut back on the amount of times it does that and being really strategic about it we get a lot of insight into jesse character that way because she learned to be quite closed down and keep a lot of things close to her chestsometimes when you are having a conversation with another character its almost like there are three people present in the room creative director sam lake says we have jesse who says things out loud we have the other character replying and then we have jesse on the level of vo commenting or revealing to us how she really feels if she is saying something differentlake hinted that breaking the fourth wall may happen occasionally sometimes it will seem like jesse is talking directly to the player but it may not ever be completely clearhearing jesses thoughts can go a long way in control helping us piece together a narrative from her perspective this is especially important since the game has an enigmatic story that doesnt always give answers it leaves breadcrumbs and conclusions up to the players interpretationi personally like mysteries lake says i like not having all the answers given to me because thats an active state and you are thinking about it and joining inhowever finding a balance between offering truths and keeping the mystery can be difficult and remedy doesnt want to leave players frustratedthe challenge of that is to have that not feel cheap maggs says the new weird genre is defined by the fact that it bewilderment and the desire to know what is behind a door is another door and then another door you want to encourage people to want to uncover these mysteries but also keep giving them mysteriesmaggs says she hopes players will feel like they got an answer but also want to know more lore plays a major role in control and you can expect to find audio logs video logs and documents to read as you explore the oldest house the team is aware that quantum break had a lot of text to rummage through so remedy is planning to cut back for controlthe same can be said for liveaction segments since max payne remedy has flirted with meshing other mediums like tv with gameplay and this continues in control but in a more condensed formwere trying to find methods for using these different mediums more as part of inside the world lake says this is unlike quantum break where we took you out of the game and into the show but here we are using them inside the worldone of controls characters doctor casper darling appears through short liveaction segments viewed on monitors throughout the oldest house darling is played by matthew porretta the voice actor for alan wake as head of research darlings eccentric decadesold videos have helped current staff stay alive against an otherworldly threat known as the hisswe wanted to make the videos slightly crude clumsy amateurish by design because its meant to be that bureau communication department has created these videos for internal communication lake says so its meant to be slightly awkward and clumsy these guys arent professionals for media presentationslive action is also used for a deceased character zachariah trench who appears to jesse through ghostly apparitions he is the former director of the bureau and we find out early on that hes been killed as you lead jesse through her journey you attempt to find ways to connect with trench better since his messages to you from beyond the grave come out as fragmented and difficult to understand lake hints that there are mysterious devices around the oldest house that can helpwe are actually using a combination of inengine elements and liveaction material so those silhouettes of him appearing that you might have seen thats shot in liveaction but then we are putting that in weird layers into the game engine so it feels strange lake saysit clear remedy is putting a lot of effort into controls story and hasnt lost its ambition of attempting creative ways to tackle it maggs likens the oldest house to a narrative wonderland and so far we couldnt

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/22/how-remedy-is-approaching-side-missions-in-control,How Remedy Is Approaching Side Missions In Control,remedy entertainment has garnered a reputation for engaging storytelling through guided linear experiences thanks to standout titles like max payne alan wake and quantum break however control looks to smash preconceived notions about the projects the studio works on by delivering a more openended experience one way remedy is hammering home this idea of encouraged exploration is through optional side missions that players can choose to engage with or ignore altogether these missions not only give you new unique gameplay to explore but youre also able to glean more information about jesse the oldest house the federal bureau of control and the hisscontrol is a game based in the unexpected and unexplainable so you can expect many mysteries during your journey through the oldest house the nonlinear format of the game let remedy experiment more with side content for those who truly want to learn all they can about the supernatural entities and mysteries of controls worldaccording to game director mikael kasurinen when developing past games remedy has typically looked for an exciting loop of action then attempted to recreate that experience throughout the entire game the team is taking a vastly different approach with controlhere we have shifted our goal so we want to go for more complex scenarios more different abilities and you choose the way that you want to fight he says it means that the combination of what abilities you have how you have upgraded them and what weapon mods and character mods you have actually affects the way you should fight your way through the scenariosi watched a developer play through a side mission in its entirety a desperate man named phillip begs jesse for help as she passes by in the room with phillip is what appears to be a retrostyle refrigerator as with most things in control this fridge is more than meets the eye as its a dangerous altered item this item requires someone to keep eyes on it in order to appease it phillip explains that he cant look away from a refrigerator or something really bad will happen the federal bureau of control set up shifts with its employees to watch the fridge but in the chaos of the hiss invasion poor phillip has been forgotten you can choose to give phillip a hand or leave him to meet whatever horrible fate awaits himas with most games side missions this content adds lore and meaning to the events of control but they arent necessary to complete the main storyline from a narrative perspective controls side missions are geared toward players who want to learn more about the world of control while the main storyline is more focused on jesses personal arcone of the most interesting parts about the optional content is seeing how this invasion is affecting different areas of the building and its many employees the side missions are some of my favorite because they color the world in a different way because you actually get to see some of that narrative lead brooke maggs says they fold into the narrative by introducing you more to the npcs you discover along the way so when you meet helen marshall in the main story missions you do later get to do a side mission thats a personal favor for her and then you find out more about her role at the bureau and what she does and how she heads up specialist teams that takes care of a lot of these paranatural events as they happenin addition to gaining context within the story these optional missions can also grant jesse new abilities through objects of power giving much more tactile reasons to engage with the side content many of the objects of power that are really fundamental and important parts of the game are actually in the side missions kasurinen says if the player for instance doesn get the shield then what does that mean for combat it might make certain fights really tough later on because it optional you don have to go and get the shield if you dont want toin addition many of the boss fights are found in the side content in this playthrough jesse decides to not abandon phillip and we see all these pieces come together in one strong example the stranded bureau employee asks jesse to go retrieve the panopticon supervisor frederick langston this side mission lets you learn more about langston and phillip as well as a unique altered item i dont want to spoil what happens at the end of the side mission but it culminates in a surprising and massive boss fight unlike anything else i saw in my two days of playing and watching controlin addition to these intentionally crafted side missions control also features bureau alerts which serve as timebound world events a timed event spawns somewhere in the sector jesse is in and the player receives a notification if youre able to race to the location of the alert and complete the event youre rewarded with lootwhile remedy wouldnt spill any details on additional side missions players can expect they did mention that another involves a clock i assume this means the clock will be another altered item like the refrigerator but if i learned anything from my time with control its to expect the unexpected im looking forward to seeing what other twisted ideas remedy has come up with when control launches this summerclick the banner below to visit our coverage hub for control which will be updated throughout the month with exclusive interviews

Contra’s Spread Gun To Destiny 2: Forsaken,because three heads are good but four is better jeza jeopardy verlayndestinys exotic weapons sport some extravagant looks the sleek egyptian adornmentsand sunshaped reticle of vigilance wing the monstrous frame pulsing conductors and electrified bullet trails oflegend of acrius these weapons are as much about fashion as they are about function sometimes though the best bet is to just tie four different barrels on a gun slap a mysterious power source onto it and hope it workscerberus looks like what would happen if you tried to squeeze all the ballpoints of a fourcolor pen through the tip at once broke the thing and kept writing anyway its a patchwork weapon built out of the barrels stocks sights and various remnants from other auto rifles andfans should be able to spot some familiar parts theres some origin story in there some of it is khvostovinspired theres a bunch of various guns says greg peng bungies senior sandbox designerbuilt by a guardian named jeza jeopardy verlayn the cerberus uses a mysterious power source called the photonic heart to power its unstable physique though jeopardy had other plans for the heart perhaps she would have sold it or used it to power some sort other contraption requiring immense amounts of energyshe had to abandon themafter crashlanding on the tangled shore and think quickin order to avoid being ripped apart by its inhabitants using the scrap around hershe crafted the cerberus the power of photonic heart which is inside the battery casingyou can seestrapped to the side of the gunthe improvisednatureof the cerberus comes throughinits visual design the broken rustedframeandbarebones stockcommunicate a functionoverform design while the duct clamps keeping the whole thing from falling apart mean it was likely built in minutes not hours and while destiny guns tend to feature inworld ammo counters that tell you when youre about to run out of ammo cerberus ammo counter is kind of busted it can only tell you how much ammo is left forone of its four magazines at at a time so the counter increments up and down as you fire don worry about reloading though you reload its entire magazine stock at once like you would with a regular gunthe diy look may not endear itself to everyone but its worth it for cerberus main attraction mowing down fodder and bosses alike with a constant rain of spread fire the team admits the gun is directly inspired by contras spread shot weapon the guns early debug name was ssspreadshot and whileits shots don spread as wideas that iconic weapon it works wonderfully in the world of destiny each of its four barrels fire simultaneously leading to a constant spray of bullets in a large area its not really a gun you aim says sandbox design lead josh hamrick you just point and try to get closethe weapon is best at point blank where its spread is absolutely lethal but as an assault rifle its no slouch at range either its tuned to kind of generally give the same dps at most ranges so its got this weird dropoff pattern peng says he also reassures meits not as erratic as a shotgun or submachine gun the middle bullet is always in the middle so you can always guarantee that at least that middle bullet will hit so while it might not be as much of a threat from afar you should be able to confidently pick off lowhealth targets who manageto flee your initial onslaught of bulletscerberus perks also help make it versatile the spread shot package perk focuses the spread while aiming down the sight making it more versatile against lone distant enemies that also meansif youre being swarmed hipfiring will give you the widest spread possible to push them backfittingly the gun other perks are all based around its barrels its perks includerifled barrel which increases its range but slows down its reload time fluted barrel which makes it easier to wield and aim andfull bore which further increases its range makes it less stable and lowers its handling speed it a strange confluence of perks that seemcontradictory but that to be expected when the gun itself is also cobbled together from parts that shouldn really fit togetherplaying through a strike with the weapon i was delighted to see a bevy of damage numbers pop up as i riddled enemies with bullets its a total mob killer peng says it also works beautifully against bosses with large weak points such as servitors and by beautifully i mean that seeing a dozen or so yellow criticalhit numbers pop up on my screen put a dumb smile on my face and while i a hardened ads player i was much more inclined to hipfire when i knew i could take down multiple enemies at once with the wider spread it felt strange and great to have the crowd control of a shotgun or grenadeandthe reliability of a kinetic weapon all in one packagethis combination of reliable aim and ridiculous fire rate makes it good for crowd control but dont expect it to dominate in the crucible its kind of a specific use case peng says its spread makes it hard to beat opponents at range and other close range weapons should fare better in tight quarters if you need a closerange weapon that doesnt fall off completely as your opponent flees it should make for a solid pickthe spread shot does have its perks though i find it useful for airborne encounters since its easy to hit with says senior gameplay designer claude jerome the range of its shots also makes cerberus useful for unloading early in order to catch unsuspecting players around corners since you dont have to guess as diligently about where your opponents head might be its wide spread also means you likely catch a few stray kills you won get with most other weapons the way you might with hard light bouncing bulletsduring my time with forsakens various areas and features cerberus became a trusty ally since it a kinetic weaponyou wont have too much trouble finding ammo for it i ended up using it so much i forgot other weapons didnt have spread shot or at times even existed and while i likely wasnt maximizing my damage potential i was able to hold my own against forsakens tougher enemies at most ranges with it without having to switch weapons its powerful and reliable which is everything you can ask from a weapon flashy exterior or notplus you just gotta love all the numbers it puts on the screenfor more on destiny

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/21/everything-we-know-about-companions-in-the-outer-worlds,Everything We Know About Companions In The Outer Worlds,you may be exploring a faraway star system in the outer worlds but that doesnt mean you need to be lonely you encounter other people during your travels who are willing to fight by your side and join your crew and who enrich your experience by offering different perspectives we talked to a team of writers at obsidian to get specific info on three of the companions you can recruit as well as various other tidbits about the studios general approach to these charactersgenerally one writer handles all of a companions interactionsif you take a liking to one particular companion odds are good that you have a single member of obsidians writing team to thank though parts of the process are certainly collaborative all of a characters interactions are usually guided by one person for consistencys sake its a lot easier to keep any character in the hands of one person because everyones going to put their own spin on a character to some extent says senior narrative designer carrie patel the more a character changes hands the more youre getting multiple different executions multiple different flavorsthe crew dynamic is importantwhile the team wants the companions to be interesting as individuals they also need to cohere as a group they banter as you walk around interact with each other on your ship and bring different capabilities into combat we knew we needed companions with sort of that firefly flavor says narrative designer nitai poddar we wanted them to be a band of not quite misfits but different personalities coming together on the same ship and we knew we wanted a fairly confined number of them so that each would be individualprofile ellieshe a professional sort of pirate but she also has a very mercenary outlook toward a lot of things says senior narrative designer carrie patel shes fairly pragmatic pretty easygoing i think its important when youre talking about companions to have a spread of dispositions shes definitely not someone whos going to get too mad at your for being the bad guy and she has a few things about her past that shes tried to get away fromyou encounter them earlyopportunities to recruit companions are frontloaded to avoid the sense of underdeveloped characters joining late in the journey you encounter all the companions in the first third of the game because its no fun getting a companion in the last hour codirector tim cain told us at the games unveilingthey help in battle and beyondyou can bring two companions along with you when you leave your ship in addition to theirunique special attacks you can also give them weaponsto steer their approach to combat you also benefit from a portion of each companion keyskill scores if a lock is too difficult for you to pick alone bringing the right companion might give you the boost you need if you need an even bigger boost you can take certain perks to increase how much you benefit from your allies aptitudes we realized that companions could be used a lot more tactically cain says we wanted to put in skills that control thatyou can do quests for themevery companion has something you can help them with while these tasks varying in length dont expect them all to be multistage multihour affairs they give players a chance to get to know the companions better and get rewards to improve their performance or customize their quarters some problem that is essential to their character that is explored in that particular quest poddar says and thats also something we like to ask ourselves when we start fleshing out these companions what is their motivation what is driving themprofile parvatiparvati is a very sweet nave person says senior narrative designer megan starks she doesnt really fit in with the community because its all about conforming and putting the corporations first as a mechanic she likes to give personalities to the machines shes working on and creating and that doesnt fit in very well with the society so i think its nice to have two companions who are coming at it from opposite sides parvati saying oh we should help these people and then ellie is a lot more like well me and minecompanions are cool but not requiredthe outer worlds puts a big focus on player choice and that extends to deciding whether or not you even recruit companions when you have the chance would you prefer to play as a loner you can do that and finish the game though you might miss some neat stuff with a game like ours theres a balance you have to strike because you dont have to recruit the companions patel says you can have a full complete experience of our game minus the companion content if you never recruit them but at the same time we do want them to feel very involved for players who choose to bring them along while we have to be careful not to make them mandatory we also look for ways to bring them incompanions arent necessarily foreverwhen companions join they arent swearing a fealty oath for eternity if you do things they dont like they arent obligated to stick around we do have ways that a companion can choose to leave you says senior narrative designer megan starksprofile felixfelix is a rebel without a cause says narrative designer nitai poddar according to some companions he would also be a rebel without a clue hes a young impetuous brash kid who really loves fighting the man he doesnt have a stable political philosophy beyond smash the system and he tends to get in trouble everywhere he goes when the player finds him he got into an altercation with his foreman which may have involved his foreman making fun of his favorite tossball team and thats just not acceptable despite his problem with authority felix will latch onto the player very quicklythey arent governed by a morale systemif a companion does leave it wont be because of a gradual affinity erosion or because you dont give them enough random gifts the game doesnt quantify your relationships in that sense instead their commitment to you is thrown into jeopardy depending on certain major choices you make plus you will understand the characters personalities well enough to know their positions so it wont be a big surprise if they get upset when or if you cross the line even if you lose a pointsbased morale system i think you gain something by handcrafting specific moments where a companion is like why would you do this youre completely out of your mind poddar says and that also gives the player an interesting opportunity to say you might be thinking that but here are my reasons why and sometimes we can attach that to a persuade or leadership check and that helps the player feel more rewardedthey are different but unifiedcompanions have different and sometimes directly oppositional personalities and viewpoints but they do have something that brings them together you them wanting to go with you unites them more than anything starks says because they still argue with each other and it takes a while for them to get comfortable but they are also tied together by more than just physical proximity in a world that values corporate loyalty and assimilation they all have trouble finding what they want i think they all end up where they are and they all end up willing to step back from where they start out because they look at their situation and they realize something isnt right or satisfying for them patel saysfor more on the outer worlds click on

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/01/05/io-interactives-future-as-an-independent-developer,IO Interactive's Future As An Independent Developer,in may io interactive found itself in a precarious place for sale after its reboot of the hitman franchise failed to meet publisher expectations square enix io thenparent company announced it was selling the company as part of a restructuring of resources and energies on key franchises and studiosthese days according to io coowner and chief creative officer christian elverdam the latest three hitman games which comprise the world of assassination trilogy have been played by more than million people thanks in part to the developer bringing more than weekly and monthly updates to the games it an impressive number sure but more importantly it a far cry from the trilogy beginningswhen io launched hitman in one of the biggest talking points around the game was its release structure rather than release the entire game at once the developer opted for the episodic model not unlike titles by telltale games or life is strange developer dontnod what differentiated hitman from the works of those studios however was that it was ostensibly a tripleastealth action game released for should players decide to optin for all the future planned content at once a intro pack was also offered with the option to upgrade for availablei recall when we were announcing hitman in or something elverdam says and people were like what is this a scam are you trying to steal our money why would i pay you sixty bucks for something thats episodic what is thiswhen hitman was released on march as io ceo and coowner hakan abrak puts it sales were historically low at io leadership understood this new release model wasn the kind of strategy that would net strong upfront sales it was supposed to be a marathon not a sprint as abrak says this is not a game where the first month youd see eighty percent of your lifetime sales he adds this is something else this is a longer relationship with people and were going to build it over time and its going to be atypical for a singleplayer game but its going to grow over timesquare enix didn share that vision though announcing it was parting ways with io at the time the developer was working on hitman and had to let go of an undisclosed number of employees to be as said in the company official statement better equipped for our future endeavors on the square enix side pulling its investment from io led to extraordinary loss in the financial results for the fiscal year costing the company approximately million and leading it to sell io to a new investorin june io announced it had negotiated a management buyout with its former parent company for the first time in the studio history io was now an independent developer retaining rights to the hitman and freedom fighters serieswith that independence came two bigandintertwined things challenges and motivation according to abrak when io became an independent developer it only had three months worth of cash flow before it was bankrupt the studio future was contingent on it being able to make good on its promises with hitman content calendarwe said goodbye to people that did nothing wrong elverdam says referencing the studio layoffs it just couldnt continue like that but out of all of that misery was a light at the end of the tunnel really and there was something to go for that is energy that is raw energy because then things happenedafter independence i think three months after when we were ready with that content and we released it we went from million in one month to reach over million users abrak says it completely exploded from there and just kept going in the right directionby may hitman had million players we weren able to find data on hitman lifetime sales but again elverdam says more than million people have played the latest hitman games in november io announced that more than million people have played the hitman series since its debut in with hitman codename partnered with warner bros games to release the second hitman and selfpublished the game of the year editions of hitman and hitman slated for a january release will be the first proper new game io has released as an independent company it also the last hitman game the company is developing for the time being choosing to focus on new projects like the recentlyannounced project after years with the franchise the end of this era of hitman is the beginning of io journey as a wholly owned studio this parallel isn lost on elverdam who says he finds this fact fittingin a way i think its poetic that hitman in its prime in a way was the beginning for io as an independent company elverdam says right now its also the beginning of io as an independent company because the first title that we launch is the ending of this conclusion and that feels super good to be honest i think the world of assassination trilogy because it will be a whole when you look at it i think its super strong im super proud of it im super proud of what we achieved that this is the first thing that we launch makes me feel really good and really comfortable about the future,en,362.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/05/08/exclusive-hands-on-impressions-of-marvel-ultimate-alliance-3,Exclusive Hands-On Impressions Of Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3,marvel ultimate alliance fans have been begging for a new entry in the comicthemed actionrpg series for over a decade now in a few months those fans will finally get their hands on marvel ultimate alliance the black order however the game industry has grown a great deal in the last years which leaves us with a few questions will the black order scratch that itch fans have had for years does the marvel ultimate alliance formula need to evolve can it do bothwere ready to answer many of those questions during our recent cover story trip to nintendos headquarters we spent several hours with the game then game informer editors matt miller and ben reeves sat down to talk about their impressionsreeves to start maybe i should share my enthusiasm for the series ive been a comicbook reader for for nearly as long as ive been a gamer so i was in the bag for these games the second they were announced ive been a fan of this series since the original xmen legends games i played them all and loved gathering my friends around the couch for allnight superhero battles i know youre a big comic guy too and i think you have a similar affection for this series so what was your general impression walking in and playing the black order for the first timemiller i share your enthusiasm for the series ben as well as that long affair with the comics my history following these characters goes pretty far back so i come to the table with some preexisting enthusiasm when the original xmen legends and ultimate alliance games released it felt like such an obvious idea for a game to bring these heroes into an rpg framework and provide quickplaying superhero throwdowns and if anything that formula feels even more relevant now due to the popularity of the marvel brandso to answer your question when i first started playing mua it felt mostly like a return to form from a gameplay perspective this has a lot of what made those earlier games so appealing a huge number of characters and arcadey action that is fun to hop in and out of with friends the initial gameplay is pretty simple and buttonmashy in a good way but after a few hours you can sense that higher difficulties and later enemies demand a little more care particularly in the use of hero powers and how you upgrade each character i think that team ninja has brought its own eye for highoctane action so the gameplay moves fast and features some interesting opportunities for cooperationthe other thing that is apparent right away is the pure chaos that this game unleashes on the screen theres a learning curve to recognizing where your character is on the screen hint follow their colored circle below their feet and keeping track of the action its a lot to take in from our conversations with the devs at team ninja i know its one thing that theyre looking at really closely in these final months of development its tricky if they tone down the action too much its going to lose that insane superhero vibe of flying shields missile explosions and magic blasts but if the camera and action is too chaotic its hard to feel invested in the unfolding gameplay im really eager to see the final balance they reach when the game releases in julywhat was your sense of the feel of the action did it match with your memory of the original gamesreeves overall it felt pretty close to my memory of playing those old games which is good youre right about it being visually chaotic which could be a problem and i hope they tone that down before launch however as a comic fan there is a real thrill in seeing groot spiderman thor and deadpool all fighting alongside one another team ninja has done a fine job with the overall controls and feel of the game i spent a lot of time with spiderman both miles and peter as well as spidergwen i like the spiderfamily did you have any memorable charactersmiller one of my favorite things about the hours we got to play together was trying out all the different characters i think one of the hard decisions for people is going to be whether they constantly flip around among characters or focus on just a few early on in their playtime so as to immediately begin powering them up to their optimum potentialwhile the core light and heavy attacks dodge and block are all relatively similar they still have unique animations and effects depending on the character their size and their choice of weaponattack its the use of powers that really makes each character stand out for instance wolverines inherent healing factor makes him an obvious choice early on for frontline scrapper so he pairs quite well with another character who backs him up with ranged attacks and enemy debuffs while it doesnt unlock for a good while scarlet witchs healing field seems enormously powerful and something that has a great deal of utility for teamsin terms of personal favorites its pretty hard to beat the pure raging insanity of the hulk that classic thunder clap power is in full effect and i love the way he can just leap right into the thick of a big fight i also really like rocket groot who play together as a single character they certainly have some great powers but its really just the animation work of seeing them work together that is super funreeves you touched on the powers a bit there i think thats another area where i was hoping for a bit more the old games definitely streamlined the leveling process but i still yearn for the deeper progression systems in games like diablo iii it doesnt feel like this series has evolved with the times i was a bit disappointed that each hero only has four powers and while you can swap out which button is assigned to each power there isnt much customization beyond that of course you can power up each of these moves but by the end of the game i dont think my thor will be much different from your thor i guess there is only one godthat said i liked the powers i used spidermiles has a lot of electrified web attacks that set him apart from peter and gwen has a fun move that allows her to swing a giant wrecking ball of webbing at enemies cap still has his shield throw move which bounces off enemies and the environment but i dont think you can control it like you could in the first muawhat did you think of that leveling processmiller that path to improvement is one of the other things that really excites me in the game with this many characters i feel like you could invest a lot of time leveling all the character on your account there are multiple ways that players progress both their individual heroes and their broader alliancei go into greater detail about this in our magazine cover story but here were talking specifically about actual momenttomoment handson gameplay impressions so on that topic its enough to say that there are ways that youre leveling your entire alliance to be better with a particular attribute which might affect an overall playstyle for your team for instance if you as a group of players really like to spam power usage then perhaps early on you invest in greater energy to fuel more powers but at the expense of other capabilities it was hard to get a complete picture of that in just a few hours of play but i like the idea conceptuallyyoure also gaining various currencies that let you beef up the characters youve been playing the most improving their abilities which unlock naturally as you level as well as tweaking the way they play by equipping pieces which might dramatically change the way you play a given character one piece might add a shock attribute to your attack while another changes the way hp orbs drop theres room for a lot of tweaking to your point about making one thor different from another i think that will be one of the big places that you might be able to distinguish your characters from one anothera lot of leveling happens during a natural playthrough of the campaign but the game also includes this whole other play mode called infinity trials which is where i suspect a lot of players will invest time if they want to really enhance their team do you want to talk about your experience with that system a little bitreeves sure you spend a lot of time on the infinity trials in the cover story so people should go check that out if they want more details but in short it seems like a good way for some players to get more content out of the game its also a great place to farm for experience and items i believe these infinity trials are separate missions that have been disconnected from the main story but they usually take place in an area youve already explored during the narrative however they also add a new wrinkle to the action so you dont feel like youre just replaying old content for example one of the infinity trials we played had us trying to defeat a certain number of enemies under a time limit and we gained more time with each defeated enemymiller yeah the trials can be pretty challenging you know the thing im stoked about here is to have a great fourplayer actionrpg that i can sit down and play with a bunch of buddies hanging out together its easy to forget how few cooperative games allow for that and i think its going to be really fun to just blow a bunch of stuff up with my friends the game may motivate me to get a second or third pro controller for my switchreeves i love having multiple coop options in any game i could definitely see playing with a bunch of friends online i might play as spiderman here in minneapolis while daredevil joins in from denver venom from dallas and iron man from seattle thats not a problem at the other end of the spectrum im sure ill play a lot of this game while looking at the switchs portable screen technically you can play fourplayer on the switchs tiny screen but given the onscreen chaos its very hard keep track of all the action so i dont recommend thatregardless of how you play at the end of the day i think fans know what they can expect from this game its not a giant leap forward for the series but it is more marvel ultimate alliance which many comic fans have been eager to play for a long timemiller my takeaway is that the black order does feel uniquely suited to the strengths of the switch as a console and i think its going to let a lot players live out some superhero fantasies that may be swimming around since the recent movies youre right that playing four players all together on a single screen is pretty challenging to track but it gets credit from me for allowing for that option if thats what you want the game also has a super bright and inviting color palette and art style which i enjoy and i think it will also be attractive to many young players im eager to share the game with my young nephews and nieces and have a game we can enjoy togetherto be honest i havent played enough to know whether the progression systems provide the meaningful longterm engagement that the game is going to need but i am hopeful theres a lot of ways to tweak and improve your characters and the availability of multiple difficulty settings and higherlevel infinity trials should offer a lot of replayif the developers at team ninja can nail the balance between bombastic action and still address the need for readable action on the screen im hopeful that this is a game that can offer something very similar to what the original games in the series provided great arcadestyle action fun character leveling and a chance to beat up some colorful bad guys with friendsreeves nuff saidcome back throughout the month because we have more exclusive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/19/how-deathloops-multiplayer-works-and-how-arkane-prevents-it-from-being-annoying,How Deathloop's Multiplayer Works And How Arkane Prevents It From Being Annoying,the dynamic between colt and julianna is fascinating one character is trying to break the time loop while the other is trying to preserve it along the way they get to know each other laughing at each other jokes sharing experiences and blasting each other with bulletsbefore the loop begins anew the next day these interactions occur over the course of the narrative as colt tries to figure out the best way to assassinate eight targets in a single day while julianna tries to ambush him when he least expects it the unpredictability is ratcheted up thanks to julianna being controlled by another player who invades your game in hopes of stopping colt progress through the storythe idea of another player invading your game and stepping into the role of your archnemesis is a cool idea but anyone who has ever played an online multiplayer game can immediately see the potential for frustration however when i ask game director dinga bakaba about how arkane studios went about making these asynchronous multiplayer experiences rewarding challengingand fun instead of rageinducing frustrating and offputting he feels confident that the encounters will be enjoyable for playersi like to think about those julianna encounters as boss fights bakaba says at some point the targets you will know them you will have all the tools to deal with them they are not the real danger here especially if you are playing onlinethe team wanted the times where julianna invades to feel like a challenge but arkane tiltsthe odds in colt favor to make it feel less overwhelming or frustrating the first way arkane stacks the deck for colt is through his reprise ability which essentially gives him three lives per day julianna is living through the same time loop as colt but she only has one life per day meaning the julianna player needs to be creative and crafty when trying to take out colt however just because colt dispatches julianna in the morning hours doesn mean she won return later in the day controlled by someone else the team won go into how or why that works but you shouldn feel too safe in the afternoon just because you killedjulianna by breakfast timethere is something special about her that makes it possible for her to come back bakaba teases the other thing i will say is that the fact that you killed her during an invasion doesn make you progress toward your goal of breaking the time loopadditionally if colt is in a time and place where none of his targets are around julianna cannot invade this enables colt to explore and do other things in preparation for his main mission without fear of being ambushed however once colt goes into an area occupied by atarget julianna invasion is fair gameso if colt isn going after his quarry but is instead trying to extract a weapon for future loops or uncovering clues about the target for future attempts julianna presence adds tension if she can finish him off he won be able to keep that weapon however if you find a clue that allows you for instance to enter a new area you accomplished your goal of finding the tip and colt death won carry much consequenceif you playing as colt and julianna invades your game you immediately notified over the radio as she announces her presence through a series of taunts once she arrives she locks the exit doors more or less trapping you in the map you can unlock the doors by hacking an antenna relay in the area which you can do remotely and stealthily but if the relay gets hacked it likely that julianna will know you in the general area from there julianna could try to cut you off on your exit route but colt is once again the lucky one as there are two exits in every districtthose encounters do not have to be resolved by fighting bakaba says this is not necessarily a contest of skills it can also be a contest of mind games where you never actually see her because you went aroundwhile colt may have more advantages in his corner all the fortuneisn on his side after all julianna isn alone in hunting colt the whole island is on the lookout for deathloop protagonist on julianna orders so if an npc scout or a security system spots coltthe julianna player gets a marker on her hud likewise if coltgoes into a situation guns blazing or tosses grenades that will also draw the huntress attentionwe want a game of cat and mouse rather than a game of straight confrontation bakaba saysso how does arkane go about keeping this game of cat and mouse from being a frustrating venture for the colt player one way is to swing the riskreward mechanicsin colt favor the catchphrase of the game is you don succeed at first die and die again bakaba says it not necessarily punishing if i had accomplished my goals and after that i have the confrontation and i lose it might be that i actually don lose that much on the contrary if i win julianna will drop some of her loadout so you get a chance to gain a power or a nice weapon without having to do a side quest or kill a targetin addition if you kill julianna as colt it replenishes your reprise power effectively refilling your extra lives for that run meanwhile if julianna succeeds in her mission to kill colt she comes away with no real reward with so much to gain and not too much to lose it might actually be worth it for colt to give julianna the trouble she seems to be looking foreven after all of these measures taken by arkane if you still don want other players interfering withyour game you are able to limit invasions to people on your friends list or to turn off the invasion mechanic altogether if you do that an npc julianna will invade your game instead of a playercontrolled one some people will just vastly prefer playing the game alone that something we are definitely aware of bakaba says i not here to tell people how to play their game it their game but i hope they try playing online because i think emotionally at least it creates something that we wanted to create of course the ai is serviceable it will do its job but it will never be on the same level of chaosregardless of which mode you play with you can communicate with the other player in the world and you won even know who it is until after the session ends we come from the singleplayer background in terms of the games we make so we wanted to make something that feels like it singleplayer but there is a possibility of multiplayer bakaba says that person who is playing the invader they are not them they are julianna that something that important so we didn want voice chat just to keep that level of mystery i think it was more about trying to have a singleplayer experience with some people gueststarring in your campaign we wanted something that feels like it a character from the game not someone from the internetat the time of my discussions with the studio arkane is still deciding if deathloop will even tell you if the julianna invadingyour game is an npc or playercharacter we are looking at both angles bakaba says both have advantages but maybe people will still want to know that it a player i don know you tell us in the comments laughsdeathloop comes to

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/08/a-look-at-every-supernatural-ability-in-remedys-control,A Look At Every Supernatural Ability In Remedy's Control,controls jesse faden is a force to be reckoned with aside from her service weapon a transforming gun her main defense against the dangerous supernatural force known as the hiss is her evergrowing arsenal of powerful abilities that bring devastating results during our cover story trip we spoke to remedy about their creation and tried a slew of abilities ourselves during a handson demofrom max paynes bullettime to alan wakes encounters with the paranormal most of remedys games feature some supernatural element remedy wanted to take that a step further with control in this case we actually have a supernatural hero who has abilities game director mikael kasurinen says sure in quantum break we had similar ideas but i think here were really really embracing that through the different attacks you can do that was a conscious decision from the getgo lets embrace that you have supernatural powers and go as far as we can with themhowever the team didnt want to go so far down the path of supernatural abilities that control felt unrecognizable to players one rule the team wanted to adhere to was the notion that abilities should feel somewhat grounded in reality though they are crazy and extraordinary theres kind of this realistic flair to them kasurinen says everything you see is what youd imagine it to look like we want to avoid magical visual effects like fireballs and things like that we try to use the art and visuals of this world and use that in an extraordinary or supernatural waythis desire to remain somewhat grounded is obvious as jesse branches from ability to ability in the demo i played each of her combatfocused powers feature manipulation of the environment in some way whether youre ripping up part of the floor to act as a shield or telekinetically grabbing a nearby fire extinguisher to use as a projectile even her melee has subtle hints of using the environment as nearby objects briefly move toward her before exploding out signaling a compression of air before it blows out as a punchy melee attackjesse also has several abilities focused on traversal levitate and evade allow her to reach new areas giving the game some light metroidstyle progression mechanics while much of this gated progression is centered around the security clearance level you raise throughout the campaign several points of interest require you to use a particular ability to reach them a prime example is a moment when jesse comes to a bridge that is out and she must use levitate to float over the gap if she doesnt have that ability yet she just has to come back once she doesas jesse progresses through the federal bureau of controls enigmatic headquarters the oldest house she encounters objects of power these objects of power grant her new abilities however before she can inherit the ability of that object of power jesse must demonstrate her worthiness in the astral plane the astral plane hosts multiple surprises for players but one of its key functions is as a proving ground for jesse and a minitutorial for playersin the demo jesse is transported to the astral plane after an encounter with an object of power in this particular instance she is asked to show her understanding of the new ability known as seize she encounters an enemy impervious to her bullets and abilities the only way to damage it is by using seize to bend the wills of other enemies and make them join her side using this she turns multiple enemies to allies who then turn their guns on the head honcho once the main enemy is defeated using this method jesse returns to the oldest house new ability in towusing seize to capture the wills of enemies like the heavy grenadiers or elusive flying menaces is the primary function of this ability but jesse can also seize hiss clusters which buff and heal nearby enemies seizing a hiss cluster means you get those benefits for yourself helping immensely in intense battlesjesses abilities dont exist in a vacuum combining more traversalfocused powers with her combat abilities is satisfying and effective branching between abilities like levitate with melee even create new attacks like ground slam a satisfying smash into the floor that deals areaofeffect damage another effective combination involves using shield to pull rubble from the ground then launching it at enemies to stun them you can also mix in evade as you float around to not only duck away from attacks coming your way but also to get the drop on nearby enemies closing the distance on a group of faraway enemies is easy using jesses upgraded suite of abilitiesthough it features a heavy emphasis on using your abilities control also encourages you to use your gun in combat the service weapon is more effective against enemy health than abilities however that doesnt mean its outright more powerful as abilities are more effective against enemy shieldswe took her myriad abilities for a spin and got the scoop on how players can use them you can see them in action

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/04/06/what-to-expect-with-mass-effect-legendary-edition,,we got loads of mass effect legendary edition exclusive goodness up and ready to enjoy with even more on the way but what can players actually expect from the upcoming trilogy remaster here is a breakdown of the changes tweaks and more that you can expect when the mass effect legendary edition drops on may newcomers to the world of mass effect and returning veterans alike will be able to board the normandy once more only this time the experience is a bit more polished and includes content that honestly should have been in the base game to begin with looking at you leviathan and shadowbroker with the term remaster offering a wide spectrum for what it really means here is what this particular experience will have to offer in relation to the legendary editionwhile the trilogy as a whole didn see anywhere near remakelevel graphic changes it hard to deny the impressive alterations made in the first game to make it more cohesive with the following two while mass effect also saw some muchappreciated beauty bumps the biggest remaster love can be felt in the first gamethe game itself will come with a new launcher so that the entire collection including all dlc can be enjoyed all remastered for uhdenhanced models shaders and fx can also be seen especially regarding overpainting for key areas like ios eden prime and horizon also no more creepy wooden teeth for our human squadmates ashley especially seemed to really get the short end of the teethstick in the original first game making her look like george washington with that wooden grill no more normal teeth for everyone making it just a little more enjoyable to engage with those oneononesone of my personal favorite improvements comes by way of a change showed to us about feros when on noveria shepard and co go over a series of bridges littered with debris and signs of chaos smoke and fire could be seen but there was no real nuance about the destruction outside of just knowing it happened one of the improvements with the remaster is the introduction of a backdrop teeming with signs of a struggle and more fx added to the bridge itself to show signs of the ongoing conflict against the geth and saren it may sound small but those small improvements work wonders when talking about immersionthe cinematics has also seen a boost both in terms of lighting and overall feel pretty much everything has gotten a lighting overhaul which makes some of the more beautiful landscapes even more so and the scarier moments not so reliant on the red overlayplayers will also be able to choose between favor quality and favor framerate to determine their play experience which dives into performance territory by focusing on a higher fps versus higher resolutionother improvements includein addition to the abovementioned fx and fullscale relighting the combat hud and gameplay mechanics of the first game have been improved with the hud being fashioned after mass effect mako improvements have also been added which you can learn more about right hereyou can also learn more about how those iconic elevator load times have changed don worry the banter is still there with our deep dive with bioware mac walters hereother improvements includebasic performance boosts can be seen with fps on playstation and xbox one with uncapped fps on pc and playstation xbox series x the team also added full resolution audio rebalanced the entire game audio mix added on pc and harmonized all of the mission computers that not even counting the hundreds of bug fixes that the trilogy left unpolished pc players can also look forward to controller support for the first time which is a nice bonuslook i know we all attached to our shepards but it time to be honest with yourself your mass effect femshep wasuglyi know i know you don think so but it was actually pretty hard not to make your jane shepard look like an offbrand younger joan rivers and no amount of love for her will change that thankfully bioware knows we deserve better and they made a few necessary changes to how character creation worksfirst things first femshep iconic default face wasn introduced until mass effect but now that model is available across all three games you can see her in all of her mass effect glory in the screencap abovemore hairstyle options are also available including the tight braid hairstyle introduced in mass effect andromeda more skin tones more special tweaks and more hairstyles are also available as well as small improvements made to the alreadyexisting optionsyou can also access additional casual outfits in mass effect think war and then make itfashionspoilers are marked with the black line to uncover the spoiler simply click on the black stripes on the article to show the words underneathunfortunately no cut content was included in the remaster so for those hoping to romance kaidan as maleshep in or seeing tali face we got bad news but the bright side is that a ton of other content is now availablewhen the trilogy first came out each game had its own set of dlc with and that dlc was downright imperative making it odd that the team decided to make it dlc and not in the game at no charge while some of it was a fun expansion worth paying the extra dollars looking at you citadel dlc others like lair of the shadow broker leviathan and from ashes were vital to the story from ashes gave players a chance to have a new squadmate the last living prothean named javik leviathan took shepard on a whole new and scary adventure to uncover the birth of the reapers and who gave them life lair of the shadow broker explains the events of how liara became the hostess with the mostess in terms of information something that happens no matter what but you can actuallyhelpwithout that particular dlc lair also tied in with the comic that showed liara teaming up with feron to recover shepard and put them in the hands of cerberusfor the dlc you can enjoydlcweapons armors packspromosto learn why there is no pinnacle dlc or mass effect multiplayer you can read our interviews with director mac walters and developer kevin meek with our previous coverage here and here respectivelythe internet is up in arms about changes made to the trilogy regarding certain camera angles that were in no way necessary and in no way changed the story nor does this change impact romance scenes so what the big dealin mass effect femshep is given an little black dress while maleshep is giving a swanky leather jacket the movement of the characters was not developed with jane vs john in mind so femshep would often be seen sitting down in her short little dress completely without care and knees spread apart not a typical pose for that attire this is one of the changes made with tweaking some of the movements ingame making interactions seem less stilted and awkward and more into a natural progressionkevin meek character and environment director told metro that the team wanted to pay attention to how femshep is ingame an oversight made in the initial trilogyspecifically around the animations we couldn really change a lot of those but there were times where you could change the camera to not focus on one of those animations meek explained so a male shepherd animation would have him sitting with his legs quite wide open with a low camera where if you were wearing a skirt it would be a bit unflattering so we can necessarily change that animation but you can raise that camera up slightly to reduce the problembioware also added small tweaks to her face and how she catches the light facial expressions and more to make her more humanyou also may have heard about some changes regarding miranda butt the discussion there is simply reducing the amount of camera cuts that focused on her booty there were so many times when shepard would speak with miranda only to cut awkwardly just to focus solely on her backside which had a tendency to breakthe immersion when talking about serious topics likeoh i don knowthe impending damnation of all life in the galaxythe character model will remain the same the romance scenes will remain the same they are simply making the camera cuts more meaningful this is a good thing because this story isincredibleso there you

Warcraft,warcraft ii tides of darkness was one of the biggest pc releases of the blizzards second realtime strategy game won several awards and elevated blizzard as a developer that cared about polish and game mechanics however even though fans had enthusiastically warred their way across the land of azeroth blizzards fantasy world felt largely devoid of personality players loved warcrafts actionpacked skirmishes but its world was irrelevantthen in late blizzard sister company capitol multimedia suggested blizzard adapt the warcraft franchise into another genre in the early adventure games like day of the tentacle the secret of monkey island and myst ate up a significant portion of the pc market and blizzard felt developing an adventure game set within the world of warcraft was a smart move blizzard prototyped what would become warcraft adventures lord of the clansone of the things we worked with was establishing what the environments look like says blizzard senior art director samwise didier in the rts world its all topdown and the environments have to be flat and simplistic because gameplay comes first you dont want to step on the gameplay with the environment but with lord of the clans we were able to take a thirdperson view for the first time you could actually have a horizon so you could create things that were super tall in the background and that wouldnt mess with the characters or gameplayfor lord of the clans animated sequences blizzard partnered with a subdivision of capitol multimedia called animation magic unfortunately animation magics track record was very hitormiss in addition to its work on the wellreceived educational game im meen animation magic developed the muchmaligned link the faces of evil and zelda the wand of gamelon games for phillips failed cdi interactive media playeras animation magic oversaw the production of what would eventually amount to more than minutes of classic blizzard dreamed about what it would be like to live in azeroth the team eventually cooked up a new character named thrall a young orc who had been captured at birth and raised as a slave inside a human settlement a corrupt human lord named aedelas blackmoore had educated thrall hoping to mold the orcling into a perfect warrior over the course of the game players would follow thrall as he escaped blackmoores secret fortress learned about the oppression of his people and ultimately spearheaded a revoltblizzard was heavily inspired by lucasarts adventure games and lord of the clans interface was even modeled after the visual interface in full throttle instead of using prewritten verbs players could click on objects within the environment which would bring up a graphical interface full of available actions for example if a player wanted to look at something they would pull up the interface and click on an animated eyeball if they wanted to pick up and object they could click on thralls handlike most adventure games of the day lord of the clans asked players to collect items and combine their tools with objects in the world early on thrall had to stuff a rock into a sock which created a makeshift club that could then be used to smash a lock later thrall would use a mirror to redirect electric beams jump on a shield to snowboard down a mountain and unlock a goblin zeppelin that could be used to travel to new areasa press release from the era boasted the game would feature different settings more than featurefilmquality animations and a compelling plot guaranteed to enthral sic fantasy fans blizzards marketing also referred to lord of the clans as a dark comedy but some of its jokes were a far cry from mature for example at one point thrall finds himself in a gnome workshop where an annoying chicken flaps around in front of him at this thrall says it taking all my willpower not to choke the chickenblizzard worked on warcraft adventures lord of the clans for over a year the studio even recorded several hours of ingame dialogue using highlevel vocal talent such as peter cullen optimus prime from transformers clancy brown highlander shawshank redemption carnivale and tony jay shere khan from talespin however by early it was clear the project wasnt coming together days before the industry hoped to get a better look at blizzards project during the expo in atlanta blizzard canceled the project fans petitioned the company to release the game but blizzard had made its decisionone of the reasons we pulled back on doing it was because i dont think we really found the fun didier says at that time other games were coming out that were already doing what we were doing and then some by then some of those highend adventure games were coming out by the time we would be set to come out lord of the clans would have seemed dated it would not have been the coolest one out therein an unfinished build of warcraft adventures lord of the clans leaked online and gave fans a look at what they had missed years earlier animation magic outsourced lord of the clans cutscenes to an animation studio in south korea but the work was clearly subpar even by standards many also felt that blizzards adventure game puzzles were fairly generic and uninspired turns out fans who had petitioned for lord of the clans release hadnt missed muchin fact the same year that blizzard canceled lord of the clans lucasarts launched grim fandango a bigbudget adventure game from legendary creator tim schafer grim fandango was a critical darling but failed to sell which only punctuated how far the adventuregame industry had fallen since its heyday less than a decade before if a stateoftheart adventure game from an experienced creator had failed to tap the market then blizzards experiment likely wouldnt have fared much betterit wasnt a waste didier says much like with starcraft ghost we got something out of lord of the clan because thats where thrall came from we loved the character so we said okay hes going to be in warcraft iii and well just have to tell people what his story isthrall wasnt the only gift lord of the clans gave blizzard characters like grom hellscream alexstrasza the dragon queen and deathwing were all concepted for the game as were fictional locations like dalaran and alterac writer chris metzen passed his development notes over to star trek novelist christie golden who wrote the warcraft lord of the clans novel a reimagining of the adventure game that functioned as a prequel to warcraft iii finally blizzards exploration with adventure games gave the studio an opportunity to walk around the world of azeroth something the team would do in greater detail with world of warcraft a few years later fans might not have received the adventure game they wanted but in the end lord of the clans gave warcraft fans a worldthis article originally appeared in the april issue of game informerfor more warcraft related content click on our banner hub for warcraft iii reforged from

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/01/08/how-character-progression-works-in-sekiro-shadows-die-twice,How Character Progression Works In Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,one of the ways sekiro shadows die twice marks a departure forfrom software is in how your character becomes stronger in other from games you tailor your character by pouring points into different stats like strength dexterity and intelligence depending on whether you want to fight as a brute archer or wizard respectively shadows die twice wont have that breadth of customization as your character the wolf is a shinobi through and through that doesnt mean you cant tailor him to fit your playstyle thougha major departure hardcore from fans may scoff at is the lack of corpse runs though you gain experience from defeating foes in shadows die twice that experience is now divorced from currency gold now drops from enemies as well and you wont lose either when you die if youre afraid that change might upset the balance of tension and accomplishment that have come define from games theres hope director hidetaka miyazaki says death will have a detrimental effect but wasnt willing to tell us what that might beinstead progression in shadows die twice is slow but steady as the experience points you gain from killing enemies fill a bar that eventually provides you with a skill point that you guessed it you can spend in a skill tree but it wouldnt be a from game if there wasnt a catch before you can invest in a skill tree you have to unlock it by finding a particular item as you explore the worldonce youve unlocked a skill tree you can invest skill points at sculptors idols shadows die twices take on bonfires from showed us a few skill trees for the wolf one based on shinobi arts one around samurai arts and another based on building up theprosthetic arm along with passive buffs and improvements to your basic moveset you can also unlock special moves called combat arts activated by pressing both front shoulder buttons and which must be equipped separately these moves are meant to be periodic rewards that let you invest in a particular playstyle just to give you something to make you feel like youre roleplaying in a certain way says yasuhiro kitao manager of marketing and communications at from softwareeach of these trees is catered to a different playstyle the samurai skill tree for example resembles the common warrior archetype which relies on overt grounded aggression the shinobi tree is more evasive and lets you control crowds with skills like a spinning slice attack that deals damage in an area and the ability to step over enemy spears finally the prosthetic tree offers multiple more ways to approach different encounters with the option to upgrade your shuriken throw with a followup attack that closes the distance between you and your opponent or to let you throw multiple shurikenwhat we saw of these trees was fairly simple though they werent final we saw about three or four pathways to take our skill tree with the final tier of skills requiring four skill points how long these skill points will take to earn is still up in the air however the goal is to allow you to be more creative and find your preferred ninja style so youll have to specialize and think about which path you want to take kitao sayswhile the skill tree lets you build out the wolf in various ways upgrading his other statswill require more attentive eyes as you venture through shadows die twice slay enemies and bosses and find hidden rooms be on the lookout for prayer beads four of which will increase your overall health and posture the legend of zeldas heart pieces come to mind you might also find tools to upgrade your prosthetic arm with new abilities such as a shuriken launcher an axe or a flame vent granting you access to new abilities to take with you on the battlefield there might even be ways to build on the resurrection mechanic from tells usall of these options make for one wellequipped character instead of several kinds of specialized warriors from says this style of progression which streamlines options at the cost of variety compared to dark souls and even bloodborne lets them focus on offering more overall depth to individual encounters as from can more easily tailor encounters around your characters skillset this is actually using miyazakisans own words you could think of the previous souls games as more expanding laterally and adding breadth to these various options and builds kitao says while you are a fixed shinobi protagonist you do feel like theres a sense of progression theres a sense of building your own character and finding your own playstyle and experimenting with this throughout the gamefor more on

reliving the same day over and over and you one of the very few who seemto realize it do you embrace the absurdity of the situation and take advantage of the time loop or do you do everything in your power to put a stop to the loop and escape the island the main characters in arkane deathloop colt and julianna find themselves in the same situation but they opt to take opposing paths while julianna is having the time of her life on the island reliving every day and treating the experience like a neverending party colt wants to break the loop and escape by any means necessary unfortunately only one of them can get their wayas you might imagine players control how the conflict between colt and julianna plays out as youcan choose to take control of either character if you choose colt you replay the same day to formulate and execute the perfect plan tobreakthe loop if you choose julianna you invade other players games as the guardian of the loop and do your best to disrupt their attempts to break everything julianna has worked forcolt wakes up every morning with a terrible headache he made the awful decision to drink heavily the night before entering the time loop giving him a dailyhangover while memory loss is a somewhat common symptom of prior bingedrinking colt suffers from something far worse he doesn remember his past or reallymuch about himself at all what he does remember however is the events of the previous loops making him one of seemingly two people who carry their memories forward after each time loop resetjulianna is one of the first people colt meets when he wakes up on the island for the first time she mysteriously seems to know a lot more about him than he does about her colt has no idea why he on the island or what the island even is but he soon begins to learn more about himself as julianna talks to him over the radio and eventually in the flesh she is his nemesis his antagonist game director dinga bakaba says she is at every turn waiting for him in ambush she is taunting him over the radio teasing him with tidbits of information about the mystery of the island but not revealing stuff directly to himthis situation spells a waking nightmare for himhe in a sty situation bakaba says i mean he wakes up with a hangover every single day that a rough way to start the day on top of that everyone on the island is trying to kill him including julianna who is being very crafty about how to kill him he really in a dire situation and i think he sees something that julianna doesn seeall of these people on the island know they in a time loop but they don realize it the same day over and over they all think they waking up on the first day of the loop every day colt thinks that no way to live and begins to feel sorry for them even though they all trying to kill him at julianna orders he desperately wants to escapeso that he may begin to once again piece together his life in order to do that he has to figure out a way to break the loopto break the loop colt figures out he needs to assassinatethe eight visionaries on the island within a single day there a very specific way to do that so to be successful it will require trial and error over the course of several loops of course even colt figures out the perfect plan for taking out the targets in the right order the bestlaid plans can quickly go downhill when you have a big target on your own back with another assassin waiting to ambush you at any momentjulianna wants to preserve the loop which means trying to stop colt despite being very serious about her mission she goes about it in a fun way poking at colt and having fun at his expense julianna views the whole time loop experience as harmless fun and colt steadfast desire to ruin the party for everyone else tells her she has to put a stop to him she really sees him as the ultimate party pooper bakaba says he trying to ruin everything that the aeon program worked towardfor yearsnot only does julianna think colt is trying to ruin the fun for everyone else but also that he being ungrateful and squandering the opportunity for himself the way she sees it colt is being handed over the best gift in existence you know never dying no consequences the opportunity to be your best selfad infinitum bakaba says and he just saying i want out really just cannot reconcile that not only can she not accept it because if he manages to do that he will ruin not only her fun but her work and her goals and her philosophy but i think she quite enjoying the huntbecause colt and julianna are seemingly the only two who remember the events after the time loop reset each day the two become increasingly familiar with one another the banter between the two borders on teasing and joking but the hostile tension persists as the two simultaneously works toward opposinggoalseven though she gets on his nerves and is quite literally trying to kill him julianna is the one person colt can talk to there is a very interesting dynamic between the two characters bakaba says she seems to have quite an interest in him not only in stopping him but she wants him to keep trying even though she will do everything to prevent him from accomplishing his goals of breaking the loop i think they are both fascinated by each other to some extent it doesn immediately show on julianna sidethis dynamic leads to nuanced interactions between the two giving their relationship more layers than the antagonistic relationships typical of entertainment media i would say they are enemies because there is definitely some connection between the two bakaba says they will sometimes laugh at the same jokes they will sometimes just talk about their situations but most of the time they have radically opposing views on the situation and radically opposing goals it an interesting dynamic and they are both full of surprises so it never boring to hear them interactone of the more interesting things julianna does to colt is begin eachday announcing to every inhabitant on the island that colt is a traitorand should be killed on sight julianna wants colt to fail in his mission but according to narrative director bennett smith there more at play than simply wanting colt stoppedthat part of her method of making it more fun smith says when colt is put under pressure he overcomes the obstacles that are before him just like a player would the player gets more powers or guns or whatever and gets more skilled in the mechanics of the game they become better at what they do which is killing people usually and fighting her making it more challenging for her she sets you up at a disadvantage from very early on she like go kill colt colt has to navigate around this obstaclebut is there more to it than that hearing that julianna wants colt to get better and better so that it a greater challenge for her is all well and good but is she testing and training him for a greater task is there more at play than julianna initially evident motivations would have you believe we have to wait until the full game release to get a solid answer but smith says that early on julianna tells colt she wants him to get better at killingshe pretty much stated that to him pretty early on smith says she says to him something to the effect of chop let go i want you to be good so go kill these guys and then come talk to me again but of course she can show up and kill you so that kind of the fun part of itart director sbastien mitton credits the work of smith who leveraged his experience working with actors in los angeles for getting the most out of colt and julianna interactions i love the dialogue between colt and julianna and how colt reacts to some events around him mitton says there are insults but it all interesting it not just random swear words something really happening between colt and julianna and of course each character in the environmentthe visual design of each character reflects their personalities for mitton the main references for colt design wereactor lee marvin as he appeared in the filmpoint blank and kurt russell inthe thingandescape from new york with a twist of tarantino inspiration for good measuredespite his assumed military background colt sports a leather jacket that more retro militaryinspired than ripped straight from the ranks of any branch of the armed forces his jacket crackles and reflects light as you move through the world and he sports gloves that recall mitton days as a harley davidson rider while colt has his signature look his mood is often shown through his wardrobe as well as his personalitywe have mad colt and the colt who a bit more depressive you can see that through narration but also on him and what he wearing mitton says it really interesting because it goes back and forth between narration design visuals and we each feeding each other until we get to a satisfying result for everyonefor julianna mitton wanted to lean heavier into her personality with her design julianna is playful by nature so it was important to have a design that reflects that she represents an eternal youth and work as well she worked really hard to keep her memory says mitton she has a big library in her house and she works to preserve the loop she the guardianjulianna features several different looks but mitton says the team tried to remain true to the spirit of her character even if we change her outfits and her clothing we try to keep her characteristics and her psychological characteristics he says we don just make visual skins to have variation we really want

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/18/the-universe-of-the-outer-worlds,The Universe Of The Outer Worlds,one of the most exciting aspects of the outer worlds is the opportunity to see the roleplaying experts at obsidian try their hand at a brandnew setting while the gameplay of this new franchise draws comparisons to other firstperson rpgs the universe that players explore is entirely new set in a distant corner of the galaxy the outer worlds is a fascinating mix of classic scifi pulp and an irreverent sendup of corporate culture and capitalism the character you play is in many ways as much an outsider as you are as the player a recently unfrozen colonist forced to contend with a bizarre culture and alien solar system and that backdrop promises to be especially memorablethis is an alternate history says codirector leonard boyarsky there was a point where the timeline split off it was at a certain point around the time of einstein there was a first world war but it was for different reasons and maybe there wasnt a second world war one of the defining features that set earth apart in this new timeline is the nature of companies classism and the central importance of moneymaking imagine the already absurd power of corporations banks and billionaires in the real world and ratchet it up several more degrees what if the trusts hadnt been broken up boyarsky muses you have these robber barons at the turn of the century a couple of hundred years later what if we still have that culturein this twist on history earth is already the domain of massive and powerful companies as humanity begins to spread out across the stars rather than the intrepid explorers and diplomats of some other science fiction properties its the reaching arm of capitalism that sends humanity hurtling into the void and habitable planets across the galaxy are being carved up like parcels of land in the american old west this first installment of the outer worlds focuses on one particular solar system called halcyon and the ten companies that banded together to purchase it the corporations have pretty much taken over everything boyarsky says but they want to go that last little bit and make it the perfect society for corporations when earth was colonizing the furthest reaches of the galaxy they bought one of the furthest colonies and set up what they thought would be a corporate utopia where they can control every aspect of peoples liveswhen speaking to the developers at obsidian its especially exciting to learn how expansive this new universe really is while halcyon has received the bulk of the attention and fleshing out the team isnt shy about highlighting this one solar system as just one part of a larger network of humans across the stars we made a list of the other colonies says codirector tim cain they have names and what their major products are there are some companies and governments that were big enough that they just bought a colony on their own ours is unusual in that there are ten different corporations but its because it was so far away and took so much money we also have said that there is one guy who is pretty much like the bill gates of the universe he was so wealthy that he bought a colony by himself and the first thing he did was seal it off no ones been there for a hundred yearsits not just the path of corporate greed that has taken a different direction in the outer worlds obsidian has also spent time establishing different rules around physics and natural law its all internally consistent but its meant to flex to the needs of a central guiding mantra fun trumps realismthe alternate nature of science is perhaps best represented by the nature of space travel and how it feeds into the main story of the game in this universe they found a way of increasing your velocity discontinuously cain explains if you can go from one velocity to another and not occupy the ones in between you can really get really close up to the speed of light and then jump over the light speed barrier they found a way to do it whats weird is that when you do skip over light speed youre in some other weird space everythings gray you cant see anything and you cant turn as a result mistakes are possible and thats exactly what happens with the games main character and the thousands of other colonists onboard the hope the second colony ship that had been heading to halcyon after coming out of skip space early the hope took many more years to reach its destination and by then this new corporate colony no longer knew what to do with themthe halcyon system and its colonies didnt turn out the way the corporate board had hoped things looked promising in the beginning with two seemingly habitable planets and an initial group of colonists aboard a first ship but even before the hope went missing problems aroseone of the habitable worlds terra was a moon orbiting a massive gas giant called olympus human terraforming didnt work on the planet and among other problems much of the local fauna was dramatically altered sizing it up into mega versions that posetremendous threats to human life ingame terra has been renamed as monarch and its a dangerous place to live its also where the boards outsized influence has begun to fray as many groups and individuals are rebelling against the companiesfor players monarch will replicate some of the expectations of an openworld space but on a smaller scale monarch has a bigger wideopen playspace boyarsky says theres three or four different little towns on monarch because it has a big wideopen area you can walk between them or just fly to the different ones in your ship once you unlock the landing padsthe other comfortably habitable planet orbiting the halcyon star is called terra and it remains much more under the sway of the board here the colonists have largely accepted and even embraced their roles as corporate workers but the faade is slowly breaking down as towns slowly fall into disarray marauding thugs who have abandoned the company life wander around outside the towns and even inside the appearance of homey comfort has begun to fray as prefab structures have begun to fall apart and jobs remain unfilled even as the various companies try to keep up good appearancesits here that players will visit one of several contained locales including the smaller settlements of edgewater inside the emerald vale and roseway the town first shown in early videos for the outer worlds terra is also home to byzantium the gilded city of the welltodo where every halcyon colonist wishes they could live byzantium is closed off to those without the means to be appropriate residents its a literal gated community with secrets that lesser company workers will simply never learnwhile terra and monarch are the two largest and most involved environments that players will encounter they are not the only places that players will visit several other smaller destinations play important roles in the unfolding game especially the ship that brought that first group of colonists to the system the groundbreaker is the original colony ship parked in the lagrange point of terra cain explains this station acts as a main port for the system as ships come and go freighters that come from out of the colony unload their stuff there and go from there to be delivered around the colony boyarsky says theres some people there who live a bit outside the lawin addition to rubbing elbows with the criminal element aboard the station players will also rocket off to some of the other lessfriendly planetary bodies around the system theres an asteroid called scylla which contains some laboratories and transmitting stations theres a lot of abandoned stuff there theres no town on scylla boyarsky sayswe also have tartarus which is kind venusian but its even worse cain says its just a nasty planet its where the maximum security prison is run by united defense logistics spacers choice is a wholly owned subsidiary we dont know much about tartarus or what business the players might have on a prison planet but one of its chief exports does make for an amusing aside theres a product sold called tartarus sauce for dipping saltuna fish sticks cain says with a smile what they do is they take mayonnaise and they expose it the caustic environment of tartarus for just a few seconds and then put the lid back on and they sell it it makes the mayo really tangy because it introduces a lot of very lowlevel toxins theres not a lot of restrictions on corporate food productssome of the other outer worlds of halcyon are less likely to be onfoot destinations in the game but may play a role in an understanding of the full setting there the iceplanet of typhon around which the hope has been parked until the companys governing board can figure out what to do with it obsidian also shared that eridanos is a gas giant currently being mined for resources and another celestial body is named hephaestus a small mineralrich planet near the sunthe idea is to create a believable space for players to explore as they adventure across space and that means that not every site can be visited but even the places you do visit arent likely to offer the standard space opera fantasy that the plasma rifles and rocket ships of this universe might at first suggestthe outer worlds is first and foremost a rollicking outer space adventure but like the original fallout that cain and boyarsky helped create one of the magic ingredients is a healthy dose of social commentary often couched in absurdist humor any understanding of the games setting is incomplete without grasping the ways in which this alternate history attempts to drive home some uncomfortable truths about capitalism bureaucracy and the people who blissfully buy the company line without questionit adds something interesting with the juxtaposition of this grand space adventure even as we are going from corporate town to corporate town boyarsky says theres hopefully enough space adventure and heroics in there to satisfy people and we dont want people to think this a trip through bureaucracy but there is that aspect to iteverywhere a player visits theyre reminded not just of a company culture that is governing the entirety of this society but equally important the people who buy into that system the colonists are terrified of unemployed people as much as they are of monsters what could be worse than not having a job with the company they blithely quote company slogans like theyre maxims for good living even the religion the order of scientific inquiry instills the mindset that everyone is right where theyre meant to be and straying from your job or place in life is tantamount to heresy whats good for the corporation is good for the workers and even good for humanity boyarsky says theres no greater good than serving the corporationif you go into obsidians kitchen theres this thing listing employee rights cain notes in our fictional world you go into the kitchen and theres a list of employer rights individuals are trained from birth to put the company first and recognize that they are more replaceable than the machines on which they work people love their company like its the local sports team the player is forced to contend with that mindset and its seeming insanity and then accept the ways in which it echoes elements of corporate loyalty and tribalism in our own very real societythe result is a setting that makes us uncomfortable even while it offers an escape into world of ray guns and spaceships behind the adventure the outer worlds pokes fun at the absurdity of such a society while making it just believable enough to make you think we like to subvert peoples expectations boyarsky says were drawn to deeper social commentary even though were not pretending were profound or anything we like to play around in that arenawere not making colony simulator cain adds were just trying to make this a really fun environment and if we can do some social commentary along the way so be itfor more on the

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/03/12/arkane-talks-going-from-dishonored-to-deathloop,Arkane Talks Going From Dishonored To Deathloop,over the last two generations arkane studios has made a name for itself with the dishonored franchise dishonored dishonored and dishonored death of the outsider garnered critical and fan acclaim for their unique empowering gameplay that made you think through every move and approach each situation with care deathloop is a different experience altogether but the dishonored dna is undeniably there and the lessons arkane took from the development of those three beloved titles have served them well in the development of the studio new ipbefore the team at arkane studios starts each project game director dinga bakaba says they go through a discovery process to ensure the team is only carrying forward the elements that work while simultaneously auditing what has previously worked to ensure those elements are still we always try to ask ourselves the same questions to be sure that we are still happy with the answers bakaba says in some ways it an excruciating process because you need to be constantly in doubt but at the same time i think it healthy like don rush to a solution because it worked in the last gameone of the biggest lessons arkane carried from dishonored into deathloop is the way it approaches player agency we entrust the player with a lot of ownership of their own enjoyment bakaba says that our philosophy we really hand the games over to the players that something we still wanted to do definitely i think that part of our dna sometimes we like the odd solution to a problem even the solution that we didn think about to a problem is something that we really love that our drive really in this industrythat approach was absolutely exemplified in the critically acclaimed dishonored franchise and arkane hopes to recapture that magic through deathloop we learned a lot from dishonored both in its successes and its failures we are very proud of it but we are perfectionists so we are actually harsh on everything we do bakaba says one of the things that we very proud of in the dishonored series is our approach to level design that is both designcentric around the player but at the same time there is a view at making things that make sense architecturally and are artistically pleasing so we really tried to retrain the balancethe team even learned a smaller lesson from the creation of dishonored through the results screen to hammer home the philosophy of playing the game how you wantin dishonored we see the game as play the way you want but there something small that in hindsight i wouldn do again bakaba says at the end of the results screen when you never detected it a green check and if you were detected it a red cross it a small subtle thing but it kind of means for players there is one right way to go about it and you weren able to do it it sounds like criticism whereas what we really wanted to do was report on what you didarkane stellar world design allows for those situations where you canapproach the same objectives in myriad ways that tradition is carried forward in deathloop but arkane knew it could take a different approach in some regards when designing the districts of its newest title thanks to the time loop mechanic we don have a checklist of have an entrance for every power or something like that it more that we try to make those spaces believable bakaba says in dishonored where you were traversing the districts in a certain way and because we had a story to tell we put a chokepoint to make sure that you see that cutscene or make sure you see this situation here we don really care if players miss something because they can come back the next day and witness it it is actually more open in terms of approaches and opportunities to completely circumvent combat or confrontation we actually provided ways to circulate in those maps without engaging at all with the npcs because we think it should be especially with the time loop we think it should be a choicein addition to multiple ways to approach any situation deathloop also allows you to play through the main campaign as colt or attempt to disrupt someone else playthrough as julianna while the first dishonored put you in the shoes of a silent protagonist named corvo dishonored expanded the playable character roster to not only give a voice to corvo but also introduce emily as a second playable character a character that brought an entirely different feel to the play experience as you might expect this progression allowed arkane to learn valuable lessons it carried into deathloopbakaba acknowledges that the transition to two playable protagonists gave the team insight into creating an experience for two distinct characters but it approached it in a different way through deathloop in terms of gameplay it really rich to be able to explore two different sets of powers and it nice narratively to get the outlook of the character of the events he says with deathloop we ended up making different choices one is that we ended up going back to the voiced protagonists so definitely something that we felt was important but this time yes there are two playable characters but it very asymmetrical both in who they are and what they do but also in their gameplay style they are both a completely different way to approach the game it more or less the opposite approach compared to dishonored where it was two characters going through the same adventure playing through the same thing but with different outlooks and different toolsperhaps the clearest connection between dishonored and deathloop from a gameplay perspective is in how certain powers in deathloop bear a striking resemblance to abilities in the dishonored games deathloop shift is undeniably similar to dishonored blink while dishonored players may see similarities between that game domino ability and deathloop nexusthe biggest difference between shift and blink which allow you to rapidly phase in one directionis that shift doesn stop time opening up unique combat opportunities in deathloop gameplayin a gameplay demo with bakaba i see this in action as he holds the trigger to stay in the air then continues shooting enemies below in that same demo bakaba also demonstrates the biggest difference between dishonored domino and deathloop nexus both link the fates of multiple npcs meaning that if you kill one the linked characters topple as well in dishonored you target the characters you wish to link while in deathloop it a projectile that links characters within the radiuswhile it might seem weird to have similar powers between the studio biggest franchise and its newest game bakaba insists it was very much intentional that was a creative choice to say for some of those things we want to experiment and go completely crazy campaign structure nothing like we done before multiplayer that entirely new the world is completely new the narrative tools we are using some of them are really new he says because of all this novelty we wanted to have a sure footing in something we knew how to do and some familiarity this is something where if you go completely out of your way you might lose yourself so we wanted to have some things to grab on and say is something we know and we can improve and tweak a little bit as a studio we wanted to keep some familiarity with what we done before but also for our players to have some features or gameplay style that they are used to so it a way to carry a little bit of familiarity into the unknownwhile dishonored is the closest comparison you can make to deathloop when it comes to arkane past projects you can trace other games from the studio past in deathloop whether you talking the freedomfacing design and simulationdriven gameplay of the studio debut title arx fatalis or the spellheavy gameplay styleof dark messiah of might and magic longtime arkane fans will notice tiny pieces of games outside of the dishonored series carried over into deathloop as bakaba describes it the team is always making a chimera with every passing project but sometimes the lion head is large and other times it smallwe are testing how far we can go retaining our dna bakaba says it been a very challenging exercise and process but it also very fun very refreshing and exactly what we wanted going inif you as intrigued by the world of deathloop as we are deathloop arrives onplaystation and pc onmay for more indepth looks at the

To Compete,fighting games can be tough to get into mostare multiplayerfocused affairs which can be a dealbreakers for many singleplayer fans even among multiplayer offerings they require a degree ofdedication tomemorizecombos time to brushup on things like frame data and mixups that can be intimidating at first not everyone is interested in diving into training mode for hours just to make a game fun outside of casual button mashing but netherrealm studios has long beendoing its best to turn those casual players into competitorsas the team behind one of the most popular fightinggame series around netherrealm is wellaware of the impediments some players have to getting into them we know there a barrier where anything that competitive is automatically a barrier for some people says lead designer john edwards and fighting games in particular are kind of daunting because they seem so scary and mechanically difficult to get into and there all these terms that are thrown around it just seems superdaunting just even thinking approaching trying to learn how to play a fighting gamewhile they can seem intimidating at first designer derek kirtzic is confident that once players decide to dive into them theyre likely to find learning fighting games easier than they think anybody can be really good at fighting games he says the secret to fighting games is it a lot slower than you actually think it is he says a lot of people think the faster i press buttons the more that going to happen but actually it taking the time and just inputting combos like don play the piano like this derek says jutting his fingers up and down on the table rapidly they do it very slow it very similar to fighting gamesas developers its netherrealms job teach playershow its games work but the shift in mindset has to come from the player it up to the player to break out of that thought of faster i press buttons the more things that are going to happen that end kirtzic tells me mortal kombat will run players through the basics letting players know all the tools at their disposal offer a few tips on how to use all of its attacks and techniques then let players loose to play the game however they want netherrealm wants players to have a decent grasp of the game before they get there howeverwhile the extensiveness of tutorials in fighting games can vary lead designer john edwards says the effectof tutorialson their own isoften overestimated having good tutorials definitely helps but i don think that helps to the degree that a lot of people think it does he tells mewhile much of the appeal of fighting games comes from learning to play them many people just want to have fun as quickly as possible and simply dont want to spend an hour or two doing what can often feel like homework according to designer derek kirtzic we cannot force players to do a tutorial he says in our games we always go hey you never played this game before would you like to play a tutorial and most people are like nah dog let me just go straight to story mode edwards and kirtzic aren alone on this fronttekken producer katsuhiro harada also pointed to a lack of player interest which is why bandai namco opted to only include a barebones tutorial in tekken we not going to sit there and stalk the player and be like we noticed you haven done training still kirtzic says it up to the player what time they going to invest in itinstead edwards points to the other ways netherrealm gets players to invest in fighting games by giving them lots of content that just happens to involve playing and improving at the game itselfby playing through the story mode players get an early feel for how fighting works and then according to edwardsslowly learn some of the instincts the genre requires by playing singleplayer modes such as mortal kombat towers of time which has players tackle singleplayer objectives tough bosses unlock items and invest in creating their own rendition of their favorite character using the games custom variation systemthis creates an attachment to fighting games that doesnt rely solely on being able to play them well and then once you kind of got them hooked on fighting games in general it much easier to transition them into the more competitive scene says edwardsthat transition is easier said than done however as there is a major difference between enjoying a fighting game by beating up computer opponents and playing online against other learned players edwards acknowledges the transition can be tough you going to be playing against people who may have been playing for their entire lives he says but its a transitionnetherrealm is keen on making since learning to play satisfying matches against other players is the best way to keep players hookedover the years netherrealm has experimented with different ways to do this and many of the incentives for players to play against others are back in mortal kombat once again kirtiz says the team is hoping to keep players engaged online by being more upfront about how their opponent is matched against them in casual matches as shown in the recent online beta both players can see their opponents winloss record as well as their chances to win a particular match if a player sees they have an edge or that theyre at least evenlymatched they might be more inclined to play this isn too different from most games that match players against each other but the way netherrealm surfaces this data more readily makes the expectations the game has of your more clearon the other hand netherrealm wants players to challenge themselves and improve so that on the occasion they come across a lopsided matchup they may choose to decline but may just as likely face their opponent knowing they probably wont win but could stand to learn a thing or two from their opponent hopefully it gets to an extent that the casual player will see progress in their online skill kirtzic says we want to make sure that when we match more casual players up that they actually seeing that yeah actually i can beat these guys and i getting better and better and i seeing my rank is getting higher and things like that we want to give positive encouragement to the players that are usually kind of standoffish when it comes to a ranked systemanother way to keep players coming back to multiplayer is to offer them something besides a higher matchmaking rank for playing edwards wants to incentivizecasual players by letting them earn koins to unlock stuff in the krypt and levelup their profile through experience it also

followup to its openworld superhero adventure is just around the corner in this adventure peter parker takes backstage giving miles a chance to shine as the lead in the release insomniac put a focus on narrative and told an incredibly human story about loss and standing up for whats right miles game doesnt look any different here is everything you need to know about miles morales story before playing the new game spoiler warning for insomniac gameif you havent played marvels spiderman you should probably play through that game before jumping into miles morales for one its a great game moreover it introduces players to miles an afrolatino teenager who befriends peter parker and eventually gets bitten by a genetically modified spider which grants miles superhuman powers the events of the game dont focus heavily on miles but they do show us how he gained his powers and covers several important personal moments such as the death of miles father which are bound to have lasting ramificationsthose who played the release know that insomniac isnt trying to retell wellworn comic stories the company is excited to put its own twist on popular characters and comic moments we always start with the comics says insomniac creative director brian horton that is sort of home base to go back to the comics go back to where it started vp and head of creative at marvel games bill roseman always says try stuff find ways to take these characters in new directions as long as they don break you can stretch them and twist them and then it becomes interesting so there is an insomniac flavor to this storyone big example of how insomniac changed miles backstory has to do with miles father in insomniac universe miles father is an nypd officer named jefferson davis who briefly teams up with spiderman peter to investigate the criminal organization lead by mister negative unfortunately davis is later killed during a political rally this never happened in the comics but insomniac wants to continue to explore the repercussions of this event and show how miles has pressed forward after the death of his fatherthat changed the whole trajectory of miles life but miles isnt motivated by that death horton says he motivated by different things his mentor peter parker he looks up to him and he has his mom who is running for city council that he looks up to he has a different sort of motivation to be a spidermanin the comics miles was born and raised in the new york borough of brooklyn insomniac is aware of this history but for this game the studio wanted to move the hero onto the island of manhattan at the beginning of miles morales game we learn that miles mother rio has transplanted them both to east harlem which is actually where rio is from insomniac wanted to pay respect to the cultures in that area of the city and took a research trip to new york to survey several families in the neighborhood and gain a better understanding of the culturemoving miles to harlem was very deliberate horton says we wanted to give miles a bit of a fishoutofwater story where he learning how to be a spiderman on his own in a new place miles journey to learn harlem also parallels the players journey of learning harlem we wanted to build that foundation of why harlem is a great place for this story it rio childhood home so she very familiar with it and it is a blend of cultures there a strong puerto rican population there we wanted to show that mix of cultures the vibe of that place is alive and we wanted to make sure to represent that in the gamemoving to harlem has made miles feel a little out of place but his biggest stressor might be from the fact that he will soon be new yorks only spiderman early in the game peter parker decides to accompany mary jane on a reporting trip to symkaria a small eastern european country within the balkans youll only find it on marvel maps this leaves miles as new yorks only spiderman for a few weeksultimately miles feels the weight of responsibility on his shoulders horton says he understands what it means for the past year he had training wheels on he been with peter he done stuff with peter but now he on his own he doesn have peter to lean on that is his challenge how can i do this alone and will i need peters support this journey miles steps up and is tested as a hero players also have a chance to learn more about miles during our time with the game we learned that miles is a music enthusiast and that he has a love of sneakers those details will supposedly come through more as the story progresses ultimately players will learn how miles is different from peter and how he tackles problems a little differently from his mentora hero is nothing without a great villain traditionally spiderman has some of the most iconic villains in the comic world but miles is still a young hero and his rogue gallery is still growing one of the most iconic villains is probably miles uncle aaron davis aka the prowler however insomniac remained incredibly tightlipped about whether or not the prowler would appear in the game but the studio acknowledged that the villainous organizations of roxxon and the scoundrel known as the tinkerer will both play important roles in this storyroxxon serves as a primary antagonist and they a threat to harlem horton says at first they present themselves as this clean energy company coming in with a modern clean energy called nuform they going to revitalize harlem and it all sounds great through a pr lens but there an insidious truth behind all of that and that what this story covers what is the truth what is it all really about meanwhile the underground is an organization lead by the tinkerer who is actively seeking to take roxxon down so there is this twosided war and harlem is in the middlein the comics the tinker has taken a few different forms but he is probably best remembered as an old man who is skilled with building machines in insomniac universe the tinkerer is now a woman who dons neoninfused techno armor we dont know much more about the tinkerer at this time but as an aside in the comics miles uncle aaron actually stole his technology to become the prowler from that version of the tinkerer again this doesnt mean the prowler will be in the game but it seems likelyat the core of the story miles is trying to figure out what to do with his powers horton says what kind of hero am i what does it mean to be a hero this is miles journey of discovering himself and embracing what unique about himself it a coming of age story when you go from youth to adulthood youre always trying to figure out who you are thats what this is about we call it our coming of age superhero storyinsomniac impressed comic fans and newcomers alike with its first outing into the marvel universe and we cant wait to see how miles morales game comes together when it releases for the playstation and playstation on november miles is a very different hero from peter but he is no less deserving of the spotlight and his personal story has the potential to be incredibly powerfulmarvel spiderman miles morales releases on november for the

Velkhana,over the past couple of days weve taken a look at barrioth and banbaro two of the monsters from monster hunter world iceborne were going out with a bang with an examination of the expansions flagship monster the elder dragon velkhanaicebornes frosty new setting of hoarfrost reach gave the monster hunter team an obvious creative direction when it came time to design its flagship monster we wanted to make sure that the elder dragon associated with this area made sense so naturally it went to an elder dragon with the theme of ice says kaname fujioka the games executive director and art director one of the defining features with elder dragons in general is we feel they have a much higher affinity to the element that theyre associated withfortunately we didnt have an elder dragon that focused on ice so we felt that this was a natural transition to creating an elder dragon with a high affinity toward ice in other words while you may have fended off some icy attacks from legiana in monster hunter world velkhana is an entirely different experience altogethernow that we know that the general motif of velkhana is ice we wanted to make sure that we put all of the different details into making sure that the player is able to see that motif fujioka says the design team put particular emphasis in carving out a distinct silhouette for velkhana so players could tell at a glance what element its associated with it looks distinctly different from the elder dragons you may have seen in monster hunter world which generally have more of a beefier brutish look in contrast velkhana is almost sveltein the beginning we wanted to envision an elegant monster and kind of envisioned it having a bird wingspan so to speak as kind of the initial imagery fujioka says the wingspan idea was a cool idea but we wanted to make sure that the general shape and silhouette of the elder dragon this time around was very different from previous elder dragons because it has a high affinity toward ice we wanted to sharpen up the edges and make sure thats much more well defined as well as it having more of a whiplike tail thats something you didnt see in previous elder dragonsit took several iterations and false starts before the team came up with a general shape then they ran into another problem how does it use the ice to make matters more complicated the monster hunter team tries to work within the realm of plausibility as farfetched as these monsters may seem the designers agonize over coming up with explanations for their various abilities beyond shrugging and invoking the supernatural the same goes for velkhanawe didnt want it to be defined as oh its able to use these ice attacks by performing magic fujioka says we didnt want that kind of characteristic we wanted it to be grounded in some level of believability that was kind of a starting point there we bounced a bunch of different ideas amongst ourselves and what we ultimately chanced upon was the idea of supercooling where liquid immediately turns to a solid under certain conditions we felt that would be a very interesting concept to base an elder dragon on so we went in that specific directionwhen you first encounter velkhana it isnt aggressive you can walk around it and admire its iridescent sheen without having to worry about being attacked it doesnt view you as a threat or much of anything really that is until you attack once you start the battle it darts into the air and covers itself in a layer of icy shards it also blasts ice at hunters whats the inuniverse explanationwhen it shoots an icy breath its liquid while its still breathing but the moment that it hits the ground that liquid immediately turns to ice fujioka says at the same time if its interacting with the air around it theres kind of a more dense fog that breath is able to interact with that fog and create ice in midair between velkhanas scales are ducts that excrete the liquid that it can freeze to armor itself up when necessary again its grounded a little more in the believability but executing these almost magiclike attackssince velkhana is an elder dragon the gear you can craft from it has to be impactful the team didnt scrimp when it came to this aspect of velkhanas design we went through multiple concepts and ultimately landed on the idea that you would wear something that is almost like a suit of armor in combination with a dress fujioka says this is the final version of the velkhana armor set really showcasing that elegance of wearing a dress and seeing the intricacies of if you were to actually put on different components of ice the whole idea is that the visuals are a suit of armor but the silhouette is like a dress and kind of having that elegance in both dimensionsfor the weapons the designers incorporated elements of velkhanas form including its wingspan motif and its whiplike tail similar to other elderdragon armor sets those armor sets have unique skills associated with them fujioka says we have that same thing happening with velkhana as well so please look forward to that,en,332.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/06/08/the-metroid-and-dark-souls-inspirations-of-star-wars-jedi-fallen-order,The Metroid And Dark Souls Inspirations Of Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order,to gain the best understanding of the experience respawn entertainment is building for star wars jedi fallen order you basically need to forget about past star wars games kill them if you have to certain elements that have become gameplay standards for jedifocused games still remain like timing a button press to send a laser blast back at the stormtrooper that fired it but the flow of combat and exploration are quite different than weve seen in a star wars title and in fact have more in common with metroid and dark soulsthe metroid connection is exactly what you would expect when protagonist cal kestis and his droid friend explore a world they may see areas that are out of reach or blocked by something as the game unfolds and cal and bd learn new abilities or are upgraded they use new powers to open up previously unreachable zonesjedi fallen order is a rarity among modern games in that it wont feature an onscreen waypoint system for the player to follow this means you wont see a box or arrow that is always on screen leading you to your next objective respawn wants players to embrace the adventuring mindset and find their own way to the destination can help by bringing up a holographic map that shows a threedimensional recreation of the surrounding area along with highlighted destinations of interest unexplored terrain will be hidden in a fog of warwe looked at the structure of metroid prime closely says stig asmussen jedi fallen orders director early on i looked at the cadence of getting upgrades in metorid and we mapped that out ours in jedi fallen order is nothing like that but it was a good exercise to go through i think jedi fallen orders approach will feel fresh its not exactly like metroidvania we also looked at games like bloodborne and dark souls that have the same types of methodology we studied those games and they inspired us to find an experience that works well for our gamewe saw the metroid inspiration first hand in a gameplay sequence in which cal upgrades with an overcharge ability bd uses it on a powerless machine to bring it back to life interestingly the player tells bd when to set off the charge asmussen says having this power be interactive opens the door for timed puzzles and other gameplay typesthe dark souls connection is a little looser but anyone who has played one of from softwares games should feel comfortable in combat respawn didnt want to make a buttonmashing game or one that was overly acrobatic yes the jedi are capable of impressive physical feats and cal probably is too but they are also strategists on the battlefield and deal with threats as quickly and methodically as they can if they can make an enemy stumble and expose a weakness for a onehit kill thats what they will do rather than unleashing a comboas a result the combat feels a little slower than other star wars titles but ends up being more intense as some of the best strategies are letting the enemy crowd your locationwe look at all genres and all action games says jason de heras combat designer dark souls obviously because its a very whatyouseeiswhatyouget kind of combat system the main character has a simple tool kit but its the enemies and world around them that makes it dangerous its all about the player trying to read each enemy figure out what the challenge is what the different timings are and react to that and have some strategywhen a trooper swings an electroblade at cal he can block it time this block perfectly and it turns into a parry if you don want the attack to land in any way you can side step out of the way or dive roll clear of it and hopefully reposition cal behind his attacker cal can also swing his saber freely at the enemy with the hope of breaking his defensive meter but must be mindful of both his stamina and force power meters the combat dance is similar to any of from softwares souls titles yet ends up taking on a life of its own through the force which allows for sabers to be thrown or enemies to be force pushed off of cliffs cal also wields a somewhat unique force power called slow that temporarily freezes an enemy or its laser blast in healing canisters are basically the equivalent of dark souls estus flasks which gives cal a quick shot of life when his health is low when the canisters are used up thats all you get until you can refill them at a save point the save points which give cal an opportunity to mediate also reset the enemies of the world throughout the game bd will find materials that allow for additional canisters to be made if the player takes the time to explore the number of canisters can grow quite high although you start the game with only two of themthe big difference between the souls games and jedi fallen order is the difficulty respawn wants its game to be challenging and intense but not crushing or unforgiving that means enemies wont seem impossible or cheap you may die against them but not before giving them a good runthe blending of ideas from metroid and dark souls appears to work well all of the game informer staffers who played the game at respawns studio walked away impressed and wanting to jump right back in much like insomniacs work on spiderman last year respawn is in a position to give the star wars license the video game jolt it needs a jolt that unifies almost everything we love about star wars from the cinematics and soundtrack to the action and adventure into a unique framework that blends elements from the best of yesteryear and today,en,453.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/03/11/how-controls-gameplay-differs-from-past-remedy-games,How Control's Gameplay Differs From Past Remedy Games,remedy often brings a signature gameplay element to its games like fighting the darkness with light in alan wake timewarping gunplay in quantum break or slowing down zooming bullets in max payne instead of stopping time or bullets remedy upcoming action game control lets you bend the supernatural to your will with several abilitieshaving a slew of powers at your disposal may sound similar to quantum break which also has abilitiesbased combat but with several new iterations such as revamping the ai and having highly destructible environments control weaves an identity of its ownprevious remedy games tended to be quite linear game director mikael kasurinen says here we have shifted our goal so that we have more complex scenarios with our different abilities and you choose the way you want to fightduring our handson with the game we found that control has some of the most fluid and dynamic combat we seen yet from remedy button mapping is intuitive such as pressing the right stick to slam down onto enemies after levitating or quickly switching between forms for your service weapon a transforming firearm with the press of a button so you can adapt on the fly levitating is the most fun giving off the feeling of swimming through the air seamlessly evading which allows you to strafe while in flight feels great too if players don like the controls they can remap them to better fit their playstyleone of the most interesting approaches to control gameplay is its nonlinear progression which remedy likens to the metroidvania style jesse the protagonist has the potential to unlock new abilities each time she comes in contact with objects of power found across the world abilities are added to your arsenal in a nonlinear way as you find them and some areas are not accessible until you have certain prerequisitesthrough the main campaign you upgrade your security clearancethrough this world kasurinen says and to do that you can actually unlock more different kind of doors and gateways early in the game you will face certain doors you can access yet as you go through the campaign and through the world you get a higher clearance and you can go back to these areas that you had to skip initially on top of that we have also areas that are limited by the ability you have for instance levitationremedy wants to give players more freedom and creativity in how they approach combat with a wide variety of perks and modifiers that can be given to jesse or attributed to abilities facing off against foes requires tactical planning in terms of which enemies you facing considering some are weaker to specific abilities or gun variantsit means that the combination of what abilities you have how you have upgraded them what weapon mods and character mods you have actually affects the way you fight your way through these scenarios kasurinen sayscombat can become especially challenging as you face different kinds of enemies we came across foes restricted to ground combat heavy enemies with shotguns and others that flyaround you some aren human or even vaguely human such as hiss clusters which are large glowing red spheres that continuously heal enemies to stop groups of foes it best to take out the hiss clusters first we also encountered an astral spike a strange entity from another dimension appearing as a giant ball made of spikes that is unpredictable like a glitchbecause of the variety of enemy types and control sandbox gameplay remedy felt it was necessary to rebuild the ai completely from the ground upwe have basically a sandbox environment and looking at previous games they were more linear kasurinen says let say more static more predefined we scripted every single enemy where they appearedand howand so on in this game it all proceduralthe enemies are spawned by a system and all of these things can support this world that is openendedthis development system is called the encounter director remedy ai program that brings the right pacing to gameplay when it comes to the size of enemy encounters and what the hiss have been doing in the world at that time factors like which area you in and which level you reached change enemy encounters entirely especially since each sector of the bureau has certain sets of enemiesoutside of how the ai works one of the most satisfying parts of control is how you can wreak havoc across its different environments remedy built each area with this in mind and it partly why the oldest house the setting of control has a brutalist architectural structurewe chose that style also because it gives us this kind of simplicity of form and all these materials that we can take and use that work really well for destruction kasurinen says like we have concrete wood steel glass things that you can understand and recognize and you can predict how they will behaveto lift and launch objects with telekinesis all you have to do is point the camera in its general direction until a faint highlight appears around the item you wish to select while you can pick up large things like lift trucks and desks you can also throw parts of objects like only a tripod or its camera this lets you be prettyselective in exactly what gets thrown around kasurinen notes that certain materials were more difficult than others to portray realistically in their destructionglass is always hard to get the right with how it behaves and how it shatters kasurinen says it easy to do bullet holes but if you try to throw a lift truck through glass it might not work exactly how you want itstill the destruction that possible from one environment to the next was impressive from what we saw even objects hanging on walls like extinguishers can be pulled off and thrown towards foes seeing its contents splatter on the walls and floors is satisfying too we excited to see how all these gameplay elements tie together in the full game when it releases this summerfor more on control click the banner below to be transported to our hub with

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/07/08/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-bestiary-day-1-the-saber-toothed-barioth,Monster Hunter World: Iceborne Bestiary Day 1 – The Saber-Toothed Barioth,monster hunter world icebornes menagerie comprises a wide assortment of monsters both new and returning today were looking at barioth one of the returning beasts its no surprise that this guys a fanfavorite whats not to love about a dragoncat hybrid we spoke with the team at capcom about what it took to bring the monster into monster hunter world how it fits into hoarfrost reachs larger ecosystem and much morethe iceborne expansion unsurprisingly is set in a frigid new land that setting gave the monster hunter team the chance to introduce new monsters as well as give familiar monsters who werent able to carve out a home in monster hunter worlds main setting a place to thrive after talking to the team it seems fairly obvious that barioth was an easypick for a repeat engagement the monster was introduced in monster hunter tri but tech has advanced in the decade since that wii installment before we get into all of that lets get a quick refresher on bariothbarioth inhabits the icy midtier area of hoarfrost reach sayskaname fujioka the games executive director and art director saying that he inhabits that area might be underselling it a bit he dominates the areathanks to his agility and arsenal of offensive capabilitiesjust from the visuals it has a lot of spikes and nails on the exterior and that allows it to be very mobile even on icy surfaces one of the most striking parts of its design are its two protruding fangs which resemble those of a sabertoothed tiger imagine fighting something thats as strong and agile as a pouncing tiger only one thats several magnitudes larger and it can flythose tusks are great against penetrating armor but they serve a logical purpose in its daytoday survival hoarfrost reach is home to mammothlike grazers called popo which serve as barioths main source of food popo have a lot of fur so its difficult for other carnivores to bite down on them but naturally the barioth doesnt have that problem whatsoever fujioka says these huge tusks allow it to tear into animals like that with no problemin addition to those tusks hes covered in a variety of spikes and talons again those arent just cosmetic because he uses the spikes in a way that allows it to retain its agility we incorporated that into the game design itself fujioka says so when youre hunting the barioth if youre able to use various tactics to break away those thorns and spikes it doesnt have that toolset to be as agile as possible it is one of those monsters where in the beginning its very fast and intimidating and its difficult for the player to figure out how you chase this monster down as youre able to break those spikes and slow its movements down it opens up a lot more situations to have the hunter perform a lot of bigdamage attacks thats the way the experience progresses forwardsince barioth is a returning monster the team didnt have to start from scratch when bringing it into iceborne the team started with the original concept art from tri which you can see above and went from there in the previous appearance of barioth we obviously had limitations in technology in terms of the level of detail that we could show fujioka says for example the talons or the fingers we werent able to showcase the detail previously but this time around we wanted to showcase that if it was going to be gripping onto a surface what kind of details would be in the joints and the claws and talons and spikes thats the kind of level of detail that we were able to implement this time around aside from just the spikes its important understanding the structure the skeletal structure and the skin and tonality of the monster again paying attention to a lot of the detail of the visualization of the monsteronce you defeat barioth you can break its body down into a variety of crafting components to make new weapons and armor once again the team didnt have to start completely fresh when designing the visual look for this new gear the key is to find the distinctive elements from a particular monster and incorporate those elements into the gear so other players can immediately see it and think that came from a barioththis is the armor set that appeared for barioth in monster hunter tri fujioka says this was very popular amongst fans in japan so we wanted to use this as a basis in creating an armor set in iceborne one of its big motifs was how the armor sets incorporated various sharp edges and its distinctive white hide we also wanted to make sure in seeing the different details in the armor you can kind of envision this very specific component of the monster was used in this armor set allowing again the player to figure out how this was transformed from the monster to the armor that theming extends to the functionality of an armor set too because barioth is a very agile monster we put skills into the armor set that help with both evasion and stamina consumptionthe same overall philosophy extends to the weapon design too we felt that one of the defining features and one of the most aggressive features of the barioth are the large tusks so we felt like weapons that utilize and showcase those aspects have a lot of power and strength so we wanted to go off that motif as wellif you like the look of those weapons and armor know that getting the parts to make them isnt going to be easy barioth is fast and hits hard taking full advantage of his surroundings our hunting party was eventually able to take it down but it was a protracted battle just keeping up with it was a challenge as it pounced along the ice walls and dropped down with devastating effect the expansions new clutch claw grappling hook made it slightly easier to go toetotoe with it but this isnt a monster thats going to lie down and

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/02/13/the-wildest-weapons-in-the-outer-worlds,The Wildest Weapons In The Outer Worlds,the outer worlds isnt exactly a serious or believable game but it generally adheres to its own internal logic except when it comes to science weapons these unique items are difficult to find but thorough explorers who amass a collection of them are treated to a variety of outlandish and entertaining effects during our time at obsidian entertainment we talked to the team in detail about one of these weapons the shrink ray and about how the science weapons in general are implemented in the outer worldsthe shrink rayaccording to codirector tim cain science weapons are designed to have inexplicable effects that we thought would be funny and we didnt care in any way if they were realistic the shrink ray is a perfect example of this philosophy it collapses the space between atoms causing creatures hit by its continuous beam to grow smallerand stay that way as long as the beam remainsfocused on themthe concept came from an unexpected place huge monsters out in the wilderness of the outer worlds you may encounter megafauna which are especially large versions of specific creature types visually these beasts are scaled up from their regular counterparts but the technology that produces that effect goes in both directionsthe scaling can be used for a lot more than what the artists were using it for cain says the artists didnt want to use extreme values on it because then things cant move around then cant get through doors so what happens when you experiment with those extreme values in the form of a handheld gun a shrink rayin addition to making enemies very small the shrink ray also increases the pitch of their sound effects and deals a small amount of damage but the more practical benefit comes from reducing their damage threshold in other words enemies that are normally resistant to damage are much more susceptible to it the smaller they getit changes effectiveness based on your science skill says lead designer charles staples as you gain a higher science skill it shrinks them more it reduces their damage threshold moreyou might assume that an effect that powerful will not work on more powerful foes that they might have immunities to shrink ray that assumption is incorrect if you want to use it on one of the formidable megafauna go for it you get what cain refers to as a minimega but what about the final boss right now yes staples says but then it will just be a matter of making it balanced enough where it still feels like a meaningful end to the game for most playerswhat can other science weapons dothe team at obsidian isnt currently sharing any specific of science weapons beyond the shrink ray however we do know that one of the melee options is internally referred to as the ugly stick so that hints at some interesting effects we also know that the threshold for craziness is pretty high you cant just add some goofy ammo and make the cut we had one science weapon that didnt go far enough and now its a regular weapon in the game cain says the force ultimatum it was originally going to be a science weapon because it shot out bouncing fireballs its fun but its not crazy enoughhow do you get themexplore finish optional tasks go looking for trouble some science weapons are easier to find than others but most of them arent handed to you through the course of the main campaign theyre a little rarer says lead designer charles staples theyre off the beaten path sometimes but if youre exploring these are some pretty big rewards for finding those side questswho should use themnormally a weapons effectiveness is based on your characters proficiency with its category handguns for example but because science weapons draw from your science skill instead traditionally combatfocused builds wont get the most out them these are designed by scientists for scientists cain says because we were worried like are they going to be able to hold their own in combat with science engineering and medical skills what are they going to do in combat well they find weapons like thisalternately you can give science weapons to your companions in that case you have less control because you at the mercy of your allies in terms whenhow they actually use the weapons but if your own science skill is abysmal this might be a more efficient way to deploy themwhere do they come fromcorporations are powerful in the outer worlds and they like to put their logos andor slogans on almost anything everything else is branded but the science weapons not so much staples says theyre sort of oneoffs and theyre not branded theres a single exception to this one weapon was made by a currently unspecified company as a prototype but it proved too expensive to massproduce so it was hidden insteadcan you improve themyes in addition to increasing your science skill to improve effects you can also tinker with the science weapons and other things every item has a level and if you tinker with it you can make that level go up and it makes its damage slightly increase cain says so scientists will almost certainly want to tinker with theirs and raise the level these are just designed to make that sort of character super fun so if you want to play spaceman spiff weve got everything set up for youhow many are therecurrent plans include five science weapons one for each category of weapon those categories are light melee heavy melee handgun this one is the shrink ray long gun and heavy gun however players may see more down the line if these turn out to be popular we could easily put additional ones out as dlc so instead of one ofevery category maybe wed have two or three cain says but at release be on the lookout for those core fivefor more on the outer worlds click on the banner below for more exclusive features during our month of

Bosses Are A Little Different,in from software games bosses are the main event from ornstein and smough in dark souls to the nameless king in dark souls iii the developer has crafted incredibly rewarding enemy encounters over the last few years with sekiro shadows die twice from is changing their approach to combat which means how they design bosses has to follow suit although the boss we faced in our time with the game definitely captured the feel of a from software boss fight we did notice and were able to talk to from about how sekiros new combat and traversal options could alter the way we approach their bossesalthough the dark souls series let players tweak their characters towards archetypes like warriors archers or mages this meant having to keep these archetypes in mind when designing bosses we have to restrict ourselves and how far we can take that balance and that tuning in order to cater to all these playstyles says from software marketing and community manager yasuhiro kitao sekrio with a fixed protagonist allows us to hone in on that singleplayer experience and tweak the boss battles and the encounters to accomodate for all of these tools at the shinobis disposal so we want players to eventually use every aspect of their arsenal and really use their cunning and use every aspect of their skillset to take on these really challenging foesfrom wants to tweak every combat and boss encounter around the wolfs specific set of tools exploring how they can create new challenges with them with the exception of swimming this includes some of the new traversal and combat options such as the grappling hook as well as stealth the traversal options allow much more dynamic movement within the boss arena both for yourself and the boss character themselves says director hidetaka miyazaki previously you would have just had to run around a huge boss feet and hack away at his ankles but now you have all these movement options you can both fully use the extent of that arenanot every boss will let you use every kind of approach however there are boss fights that through design didnt fit that staple miyazaki says if we made every boss one where you were able to use the grappling hook to zip everywhere or stealth kill every boss it would just get monotonous and boring in order to keep players on their toes miyazaki wants to make sure players think about how to approach every boss differently so there may be boss fights where youre up against a huge creature and you need to use the full arena and get around very quickly and use that dynamism but there may also be fights where you just need to go toetotoe and use every piece of kit in your arsenal he saysthe boss we faced off against in our demo lady butterfly showcased some of these differences in action far from the hulking beasts weve come to expect in from games lady butterfly is a smaller nimbler opponent in the vein of father gascoigne from bloodborne or the abyss watchers in dark souls iii wielding a pair of extralong kunai in each hand shes incredibly agile and aggressive she weaves in and out of our effective ranges on a dime and covers her retreat by chucking kunai then hopping among razorthin wires to keep herself airborne making her difficult to nail down she also has an uncounterable throw move marked by a glowing icon which we have to dodgethe new posture system also changes up how we think about the fight lady butterfly isnt invulnerable to attacks and will still take damage from our blows but its minimal enough that we know were not going to win this fight by attrition in order to break her posture and line up a death blow we need to keep up our pressure which makes retreating riskier than it has been in the past since itll slow down our progress if we take too longalthough its hard to keep up with her onfoot we have a couple of tools at our disposal that make the fight a little easier for one weve upgraded our shuriken prosthetic so we can follow it up with a dash attack which lets us maintain our pressure even after shes retreated additionally we have the shinobi firecracker prosthetic which disorients her long enough for us to get a few extra attacks ineventually after reading her attacks and attacking her enough were able to break her posture and land the death blow but after losing her first life enemies can have life pips just like sekiro that must be expended before truly dying shes got another surprise for us when she gets back up shes joined by a number of illusions all of which are all eager to cut us down with their hoes and knivesmiyazaki tells us most bosses have similar midfight surprises in store it has varying degrees depending on the boss but yeah you wont just see the same fight from start to finish he says they will change up even the battle tempo or some sort of newer element to the battle in various degreesluckily we have a way to dispatch the ghosts as you explore sekiros take on sengoku japan you can find hints about how to defeat certain bosses before we headed into lady butterflys chamber we ran into a dying soldier who told us that wed be doomed without snap seeds we happen to have a few and realize their use to dispel illusions popping a few of them emits small wave of energy that wipes out the closest of the illusions this clears a path for us to approach her again letting us zero in on her any illusions we dont deal with lady butterfly is able to turn into numerous highlylethal butterfly projectiles which can hard to dodge and slow down our approachas we start chipping away at her posture she summons a few more and we quickly retreat to dispel them once again with after a few healing gourds quick movements and welltimed strikes were able to finally take her down while this encounter isnt exactly unheralded in the world of from games it does speak to how sekiro hopes to change up some of the established rhythms of how the developer approaches both combat and bossesand according to miyazaki shes just one of many surprises from has in store when asked about his favorite boss in the game miyazaki points to the apelike boss we saw towards the end of the trailer shown off at last years tokyo game show he also hints at another boss though he wouldnt offer too many specific details you dont often see this in boss fights they use really dirty tricks theyre real devious real underhanded techniques he says hopefully youll know that one when you see it there will also be optional bosses to find and defeat as well and miyazaki once assures us theyll be as tough as we hopein previous from games taking down a boss meant having your humanity restored or getting a boss soul you could use to create a powerful weapon since neither of those bonuses are an option in sekiro from has other rewards in mind we cant say what we got from defeating lady butterfly but players are going to want and need what these bosses end up dropping according to kitao we do want people to feel like yes ive beaten this boss ive gotten something from it im able to improve he says it depends on the boss but for instance with one of the very early bosses in the game you acquire the item that allows you to begin restructuring your prosthetic tools so this opens up this whole new line of customizationfor more on sekiro shadows die twice make sure to check

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/10/14/meet-the-new-wall-crawler-in-marvels-spider-man-miles-morales,Meet The New Wall Crawler In Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales,few comic characters have the opportunity to break as big as miles morales peter parker the spectacular spiderman is one of the biggest characters in pop culture so there was a real chance the miles would get overshadowed by peters lasting legacy instead in less than ten years miles has risen to become a defining character in his own right and an important piece of the marvel universe however if youre still relatively unfamiliar with miles we put together this handy overview here is everything you need to know about miles morales before playing insomniac upcoming openworld superhero rompmiles morales was created by brian michael bendis and sara pichelli in in the comic ultimate fallout in interviews bendis has stated that he was inspired to create miles when he saw donald glover in a spiderman outfit on an episode of nbcs sitcomcommunity which in turn was a nod to the online campaign to secure glover an audition for the filmthe amazing spiderman for miles new look pichelli designed a black and red consume which paid homage to peter parkers original design while still feeling freshmiles debuted in marvels ultimate line of comics which was an alternate reality version of marvels main continuity in that version of the marvel universe peter parker had just died and miles was positioned to take over the mantel of spiderman miles critical reception was largely positive and fan enthusiasm for the new character was huge in fact miles proved to be so popular that when marvel ended the ultimate imprint in and killed off that entire universe it spared miles and transferred him over to mainline marvel continuity where he has settled in as an important member of the spiderman familymorales was born and raised in brooklyn new york the son of an african american father named jefferson davis and a puerto rican mother named rio morales when miles was young jefferson was a police officer and rio worked as a nurse like peter miles is very smart and miles was selected in a lottery to attend brooklyn visions academy where he became best friends with a young korean american named ganke lee after miles gained his spider powers ganke was the first person who miles toldduring miles junior year of high school he was bitten by a geneticallymodified spider created by oscorp in an attempt to replicate peter parkers extraordinary abelites hey this is comics this spider bite grated miles superhuman abilities similar and yet slightly different from those of peter parker see powers sidebar belowi feel like miles is an avatar of teenage experience in a way that has advanced so much more than when peter parker was a teenager says insomniac writer evan narcisse my shorthand for this basically is saying that i personally believe that miles as a teenager is cooler than peter parker as a teenager he dresses better than peter did he got friends he got game maybe its not good game but he can at least talk to someone hes attracted to whereas peter could barely manage that i think he more connected to the world that surrounds him peter parker early on was a very reactive kind of character that part of how we understood teenagers back then and i think we understand teenagers differently now they their own people with their own concerns and ways of moving through the worldunfortunately miles family has a dark and troubled history miles father and uncle were once career criminals jefferson eventually reformed and married miles mother rio unfortunately miles uncle aaron remained on a dark path and eventually became the supervillain known as the prowler miles and his uncle aaron fought a number of times as spiderman and prowler before they two learned of their secret identitiesmiles has a spider physiology which gives him the proportionate abilities of a spider these powers are similar to peter parkers spider abilities but also different in a few notable waysmiles comic history is too long to recount here which is impressive given the fact that miles was created less than ten years ago there are comic characters who were created decades ago who havent had the same cultural impact miles star bloomed even larger after the release of the filmspiderman into the spiderverse which some consider the best superhero film ever madethe same year as into the spiderverse insomniac released its hit game based on spiderman while that game focused on peters adventures the team at insomniac was also excited by miles and eager to work with the character now the studio is on the cusp of making miles the star of his very own game spiderman miles morales picks up the story after miles has been training with peter for several months however when peter tells miles that hell be leaving town for a few weeks miles understands that hell be new yorks only spiderman which is no small task we cant wait to see how miles rises to this challenge just like hes risen to assume all of the responsibilities that come with the name spiderman in the comics miles story has tugged on the heartstrings for years and we cant wait to see what the next decade bringsmarvel spiderman miles morales releases on november for the playstation and playstation

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/09/06/the-tragedy-of-hawke-dragon-age-2s-schrodingers-hero,"The Tragedy Of Hawke, Dragon Age 2's Schrodinger's Hero",dragon age did many things right and many things wrong but one thing that stands out the most to me is the tragedy that is hawke in many stories where there is a hero at the heart of the tale that hero goes through hell and back to become a shining beacon of triumph and prosperity for hawke however each win came with ten losses behind it ultimately leaving them to be one of the most heartbreaking protagonists in gaming to datewhen we first meet hawke in dragon age they are a humble farmer from lothering whose life is suddenly upended due to the ravaging blight seen in dragon age origins escaping a simple life alongside their mother leandra amell a former noble that left the good life behind to find love with her apostate husband malcolm and their two siblings twins named bethany and carver the first loss ends up being one of many when escaping the hordes of monsters thirsting for destruction hawke and their family experience their second loss following the death of malcolm some years before depending on which playable class the player chooses either bethany or carver will be crushed to death by a vicious ogre it a startling way to begin any game but what worse is this is one of the easier horrors that this family will facewhen escaping to kirkwall a location suddenly overrun by refugees seeking safety and housing following the blight hawke finds themselves in an unfamiliar place with no food no money and no place to call home luckily for them leandra hails from kirkwall and while she is no longer the noble daughter she was in the past her brother gamlem still resides within the city unluckily gamlem lives in the slums squandering away the wealth the amell line accrued following their parents death in order to gain sponsorship to be allowed into kirkwall hawke and their family must pay their way with blood sweat and tears suddenly thrust into indentured servitude the hawke line eventually claws their way out of poverty by killing and stealing while also taking up some odd jobs here and there to ultimately raise the coin for a risky venture down into the deep roads the risk gruesome death the reward untold richesbut as with everything in hawke path this too goes wrong this escape from the squanders of lowtown comes with a price though hawke solidifies a lifetime friendship with varric the bestdamned character in the franchise they must also be faced with another loss this is another instance where there are several outcomes depending on player choice all of which result in another hit to the heart if carver is the surviving sibling he can either come into the deep roads or stay behind if he stays behind hawke returns to find that their brother has joined the templar order to forge his own path a decision that rips him away from the family and is made even more difficult if the playable hawke is an apostate mage themself because the templars in kirkwall aren just wardens of mages to keep them safe and others safe from them many of the templars in kirkwall are jailers abusers and rapists under the paranoid rule of knightcommander meredith stannard a ruler known for her heavy hand an outcome from the deep roads drives her to the point of insanity something we don see until the very end of the game but for now now there is the deep roadsif carver comes with the party into the deep roads there are two outcomes one if anders is not present in the deep roads as one of the chosen party members carver will die following the discovery that he has been infected with the blight when battling the darkspawn that haunts the winding caverns if anders is present there is a small warden camp that can be found effectively saving carver life by having him perform the dangerous joining ritual to become a grey warden either way death has marked the younger sibling with the latter decision giving him additional borrowed time allowing him to spend the rest of his days battling out darkspawn with his newfound brothers and sistersif bethany is the surviving relative then the same can happen to her the only difference is that if she is left behind hawke returns to see her imprisoned in the circle under the templar order careful watchfollowing a betrayal by varric brother the party eventually makes it out of the deep roads with the riches promised allowing hawke and crew to escape gamlem decrepit home to reclaim nobility status within kirkwall hightown at the sacrifice of one of the siblings one way or another a victory to be sure but one that pales in comparison to the losses aheadnow secure as one of the wealthy elite in kirkwall hawke is once more at the epicenter of danger and ruin as the qunari occupation boils over the apex of this conflict revolves around two scenarios either betray a close friend isabella by giving her back to the qun alongside the tome or side with her and battle the leader known as the arishock in a duel to the death this of course follows a tumultuous battle that left many citizens dead including the viscount with his head kicked down the stairs within the keep as a symbol of the qunari total conquest following hawke victory they are offered yet another title that of the champion little did hawke realize at this time that this new title would come with the love and respect of kirkwall as well as the watchful eye of meredith and those that mean harm beneath the belly of the citya part of hawke tragedy is separate from themself found within their companionsfenris an escaped slave from tevinter tortured to the point where his memory is erased leaving him fearful and filled with hate regarding magesanders first met in dragon age awakening is an escaped apostate and former grey warden that harbors a spirit of justice within him a spirit that changes him irrevocably and leads to the final act of dragon age a sweet dalish elf with an obsession of preserving her people history no matter the cost we eventually learn what that cost is when her blood magic leads to the death of those she holds dearisabella the freespirited pirate first met in dragon age origins comes from a harrowing past where she was treated as stolen goods only to escape and find herself and what it means to be loved within this circle of misfit friendsvarric the rogue storyteller dwarf that defies stereotypes and loves a good drink but behind his goodnatured humor lies a past filled with betrayal loss and feeling unworthy of lovesebastian a starkhaven prince who lost his entire family and wandered to kirkwall to avenge their death leaving the crown for a place at the maker side as a brother he basically one walking contradiction when looking for his place in lifeaveline a guardsman whom hawke bonded with when escaping to kirkwall after she was forced to kill her thenhusband wesley when he became infected with the blight a crisis of identity aveline eventually becomes one of the strongest characters in the franchiseas kirkwall resettles from the qunari invasion hawke must then contend with their new role as champion as meredith declines into chaos anders conspires to make a stand for mage rights and the rest of the companions fall into their own personal tragedies events that hawke weighs upon their shoulders as if the burdens are their own during these events hawke also suffers what is arguably their greatest loss the murder of their mother by a serial killer blood mage obsessed with lost love when they finally find leandra after a trail of dead ends it too late they find her soul trapped within a dead body that is made up of several murdered women as they cradle her during her final momentsseeing this as yet another failure hawke fades into a depression and it here where they are forever changed a change we see later in dragon age inquisitionwhat makes hawke tale so tragic is that their heart is so open especially so when playing the blue diplomatic path they are always willing to help those around them no matter the cost and are just looking to keep those they love safe following so much loss unfortunately those around them have their own tragedies tragedies that unfold after asking for hawke help which feels to lay those failures at hawke feet whether merrill clan survives her thirst for elven preservation or not whether sebastian finds peace under the chantry roof whether varric comes to terms with his brother madness whether isabella can escape the memories of her past the story of dragon age while flawed with the gameplay mechanics of the game itself and short in nature was one that was drenched with heartbreak and real human relation themes so easily relatable can be found within this fantastical tale of dragons magic and the journey of selfdiscovery but even beyond dragon age hawke tragedy follows them into inquisition with a choice that can lead to their entrapment within the fade with the nightmare of all nightmares or a survival that will plague them for the rest of their livesthere is no happy ending for hawke there is peace if chosen correctly that finds them back in kirkwall with their best friend varric or there is certain death there is a trail paved with death murder accusations feelings of did i do enough and how did i not see this coming when looking at anders final actions at the end of the third act an act that resulted in the mage vs templar war that saw thousands killed and millions affectedwhat makes hawke so special to me which is something i talked about previously when exploring the hidden perfection within dragon age is that their story is far from perfect they are flawed confused fearful determined even with all of the support they find even with all of the determination to do what is right and to be there for those they care about it is

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/01/25/our-full-hidetaka-miyazaki-sekiro-shadows-die-twice-interview,Our Full Hidetaka Miyazaki Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice Interview,as part of our trip to see sekiro shadows die twice at from softwares offices in tokyo japan we got to chat with the games director and company president hidetaka miyazaki while youll see quotes from him weve used in our past coverage of sekiro there are some interesting and fun bits of insight throughout our entire conversationthis interview was conducted with a translator onsite and then transcribed by jill grodt and jp gemborysgame informer we had a chance to see sekiro and take on the lady butterfly is she some sort of shadowy gang of assassins from his past that he was a part of or something like that because it seemed like they knew each other whats the story between sekiro and this memoryhidetaka miyazaki so as you know this is a scene set in the past and we talked about this character called the owl who you brought up earlier he sort of plays a fosterfather role to the protagonist this character picked up sekiro on the battlefield and raised him as a shinobi and one of his old acquaintances or part of that shinobi system of allies was this lady butterfly character so while owl was training the protagonist and teaching him techniques maybe he got to spar with this character or had some sort of menial relationship with her through the fosterfather figureare we going to be meeting any other characters from this shinobi clanso we will save the actual names and number of these characters for the game itself but in general having this key protagonist allows us to build a cast of characters around him and his personality and his history we feel like these core characters that are central to his presence in the world and his story are going to be playing a lot of that role of the story in the gameplay so we feel like youll be able to experience both his past in that sense and the hereandnow of where the game takes placeare we going to be going back into his past multiple times over the course of the gameits mainly focused on the present so youll be obviously playing through the present of the shinobis story throughout the game in that sense its not a game where youre going back and forth from present to past to piece together the puzzle but this is a oneoff flashback to a portion of his past and that allows you to piece more bits together of the story so you get some extra detail and you can flesh things out for yourself in that wayare we going to be able to get the moonlight greatsword in the gamelaughs not this timeare any of the other things in the souls games going to make an appearance sort of as a nod like the crows or anything like that to trade items withfirst of all we want to make it clear that we have this reputation for featuring the moonlight greatsword and things like that in our games we dont want this to feel like too much of a bind were creating this new ip and this new world we dont want to feel like were beating a dead horse or just going to put it out for the sake of it or just going to cram it into the lore in some way it kind of puts restrictions on us so we are not featuring the moonlight greatsword this timeas to creating these kinds of odes or references to our other games within sekiro were actually being a little bit careful because working with other publishers means you have to be careful with how you treat this material and this content so if its dark souls to dark souls iii its easy to put in odes and references here or there since its the same publisher for instance with dracin that was released recently for vr we had an ode to bloodborne in there both titles are published by sony actually that reference that nod itself caused a much greater stir than we expected way more than we expected when we were given that idea like why dont you just put a little nod in there itd be great and we tried it and it blew up so we just want to tread a little bit more carefully around that frontare people reading to much into that little nod in dracinyou know it wasnt so much that they read too much into it it was just supposed to be a little homage but people kind of expected bloodborne and it kind of got a little bit crazy so we feel like we caused a great inconvenience to sony and that was really not our intentionit got a lot of attention for the game thoughpersonally yesone more about dark souls and then well move on is there going to be a zone filled with poison and giants and just a terrible zone to go through like blighttown vibesso the simple answer is yes we do have areas where the environment plays as the enemy to the player however one of the core concepts of sekiro was to create this greater freedom of movement and freedom of traversal and so we dont want to squash that by creating these really restrictive game spaces so yeah you will find somewhere like that similar to that that is a pinpoint location in the game but we dont try to restrict the user in ways previous ones doare there going to be extradifficult optional bosses like the nameless king in dark souls iiiyeah i mean this is a staple for us and we hope to meet expectations there with the optional bosses and we feel like theyre going to be pretty tough this time as wellwith all the giant monsters and crazy creatures and stuff like that are we going to see a midgame bloodborne plot twist where everything goes crazy and its a totally new gamehypothetically speaking if this was a bloodborne interview we wouldnt go hey guess what happens in the second half but if you can think of the opening of the game as a more traditional japanese ninja fantasy then its not going to continue along that same exact track the whole way through i think its safe to say that much and i think more would be a spoilerwhy the decision to go with a skill tree system over the stat systemthe idea of a parameter system a statsleveling system is that you are catering to different peoples builds so you have things that a mage can use you have things that a strength user can use you know the greatswords or these different sorceries and pyromancies and this means that not all users have to use everything they can specialize or they can focus on their build the idea of this game and the multifaceted ninja means you have to use everything in your arsenal everything at your disposal to overcome these challengesthe introduction of a skill system meant that we could allow people to unlock every facet of this multitalented ninja having this locked behind parameters or having to boost certain parameters over others meant that if you came across a tough enemy with a specific strategical grammar to him like a specific weakness they would have to go back and retrace their steps and uncover this boost these parameters and what have you having these as skills and items that you can gradually acquire allows them to specialize in everything to a degree and to really become that really multitalented multifaceted shinobiis it designed to be more accessible than bloodborne or dark souls gamesim not sure if saying its more accessible is the best answer but we have tried to make it easier for people to access every part of this shinobis arsenal in a previous title you had an area or a boss that could only be defeated by magic that would be an issue because people are specializing in their build and weve created this unnecessary wall for them this way of building the game it gives us greater freedom and it gives the player greater freedom to decide how they want to tackle this or to encourage them to try to find something else and to keep adding to their arsenal and to use every little bit of it to defeat these challengesare all bosses in the game going to feature the heat up system where they change moves based on the phase that they are inyes we do intend to do that it has varying degrees depending on the boss but yeah you wont just see the same fight from start to finish they will change up even the battle tempo or some sort of newer element to the battle in various degreesthe shinobi death blow how did that come to be were you just really excited about visceral attacks from bloodborne and the backstab attacks in dark souls and you just wanted to do that to everythingits not like we just love to do these critical attacks on everything its an evolution of the elements the death blow the idea itself is one of the things we got a hint of from tenchu from the original publications of that series also death blows are not just kind of a oneoff onetime critical attack like a backstab or a riposte or the visceral attack its something that can be initiated from stealth as you saw yesterday allowing you a way in its also something that is a result of trying to find or trying to make a momentary weakness in your opponentso the battle you experienced yesterday with the swordplay its kind like a climax to that to each and every one of those battles we feel in that sense that its different the concept and the way weve created and the way weve molded it is different from a straight up riposte or a straight up visceral attack the shinobi has the kind of elements of both offense and defensive that he has to use simultaneously the death blow is sort of like a result of that i use the word climax its kind of like a treat or reward for the player at the end of that struggle that clash of swordswith some of the changes to movement the way that you have the grappling system and the walljumping stuff and swimming how has that changed certain approaches to boss design have they gone back to the drawing board on heres a boss we can do with these options that you felt you wouldnt be able to do beforeyou mention the swimming this is not present in boss fights as such this is something that caters more to exploration and general traversal just to add a little bit of change of pace something a little bit different just to cool things down but boss design definitely these new traversal options and stealth definitely play into it the traversal options allow much more dynamic movement within the boss arena both for yourself and the boss character themselves it really increases the dynamism in how the player and the boss player play off each otherpreviously you would have just had to run around a huge boss feet and hack away at his ankles but now you have all these movement options you can both use fully use the extent of that arena stealth in midboss and boss fights it does depend on the situation but again its meant as another added level of spice its not going to be present in all boss fights but here and there it might add to the experience in some clever or subtle wayis there a particular kind of boss that youve found doesnt work well for the new movement options or is there something you wanted to do but maybe didnt work as wellyeah definitely there are boss fights that through design didnt fit that staple they dont fit the new movement options or stealth if we made every boss you were able to use the grappling hook to zip everywhere or stealth kill every boss it would just get monotonous and boring so we try to cater to each bosss characteristics and each characters unique traits and build a boss fight around those and whats going to be most fun and what we want the player to experience in that one encounter so there may be boss fights where youre up against a huge creature and you need to use the full arena and get around very quickly and use that dynamism but there may also be fights where you just need to go toetotoe and use every piece of kit in your arsenal the prosthetic tool the katana and really go headtohead on these oneonone duels so theres something well cater to on each occasion and to each bosss unique idiosyncrasieswe really enjoyed the movement of the butterfly lady that we fought yesterday do you want to talk about the initial design but the inspiration was the texture and personality you were conveying to designers you wanted for that characteryeah actually when designing this boss i had a very clear idea of what i wanted i suggested initially this is a boss thats going to use illusionary techniques its going to use these razorthin wires to hop around and move around the map i had a very clear idea and i conveyed that to the designers another thing is i love these kind of old japanese ninja stories created by the likes of yamada futaro who kind of have this depiction of a strong old japanese ninja grandma and if youre familiar with basilisk for instance yamada futaro is the original creator of the basilisk series and i had a super strong ninja granny character and really just wanted to have one of those in my gameare there anyother animes that you were inspired by for sekiroif i had to pick one a small inspiration would have been hiroaki samuras blade of the immortal thats another manga blade of the immortal was actually a small source of inspiration for parts of bloodborne as well its something i enjoy the weapons are so cool in thatits probably conveniently forgotten if there is somethingwho is your favorite boss in the game you dont have to go in to detail just sort of the broad strokesthats a tough question actually one of them that i really like you saw in the tgs trailer is just the glimpse at the end the giant ape i hope you look forward to that one another you dont often see it in boss fights they use really dirty tricks theyre real devious real underhanded techniques hopefully youll know that one when you see itokay im sure we will have you ever considered adding a boss rush mode to one of the from action gamesboss rush mode is not actually something that ive considered we havent had any particularly strong requests from publishers to include something like this either so its not really been a factoris this more of an openworld kind of situation where you can go in many different directions at many different times or are you going to be sort of gated by stuff youve killed or like do you need to get an item from over here in order to go over here or is it if you can beat the big guy then you can go this way but if you cant you go do these other things and then you can go through therewe feel like sekiros probably on the higher end of the spectrum in terms of the freedom the player has to explore the world if were to compare it to our previous games particularly from the midgame onward the world really opens up and you have a great deal of choice and freedom about which order and way you choose to explorewhat was behind the decision to get rid of the corpse runthe reason theres no corpse run as is is first of all we dont really want to keep doing the same thing over and over again with our games we want to try different approaches and different switching up the systems speaking of death penalties we do want to incorporate a new sense of demerit or a disadvantage to death we want the player to fear death in the same way they did before but this will take on a different shape this time if we were to just add in corpserunning or having to go retrieve something on top of that it would have felt too messy or too desperate or a little too much like theres too much at stakewe want to concentrate on the new systems such as the resurrection system as well speaking of resurrection this time were taking this into elements of story as well so theres a reason for coming back to life and theres more general themes and concepts around death and rebirth so this is something we wanted to explore on the gameplay side as wellyouve got these poisonous lizards and monstrous roostersrunning around with these other humans do they not attack each other or is it theyre just cool with each other how does that work worldwiseyep sometimes they will and youre a shinobi so you can create these situations in some way there will be ways to just imagine this battle between a soldier and a roosterwith this game youre taking a little bit of a step back in the writing process and not on the ground floor as much this time im just wondering whats the advantage of stepping back from your point of view what does that allow for within the studioas to what im getting personally i feel my own writing is very quirky and has got a lot of idiosyncrasies itself as someone whos written the dark souls and bloodborne games to have that again here would feel like a repeat i feel like users are going to get bored or tired of this approach so we wanted a fresh approach therealso this ability to more easily share the narrative internally with other staff and have them give their take on it and have them arrange this information this overwhelming amount of information between characters and different plots and what have you is also very refreshing and it allows us to get a better bead on the story as a company and not trying to compare this with titles from other studios or the way other studios do things but just internally we havent really tried this before so its very like again its very refreshing to have a take from other staff and to be able to piece that together in a much more coherent waybefore i didnt have that need to fully communicate to the division of the story it was all just in my head and i could just write it however i wanted and let people piece it together but by sharing it with the other staff it allows me to see it in a clearer light and potentially give us a fresh and interesting look on that contentis it a challenge personally to step back from that or has it just allowed for more sleepits pretty tough actually to step back it doesnt necessarily give me more time to focus on other things i have to divide my time in different ways of course but previously i could have just written some stuff down as part of the text or dialog at home nowadays for sekiro i have to communicate this to staff and be really quite forthcoming about it thats quite tough in itself but then to see them reinterpret this into their idea of what that means or that implies this is enlightening for me and it allows me to see this different interpretation and then to have this collaborative story building togetherwith you having to see the results of other people working that way what do you think has been the difference that has emerged in terms of tone or any differences beyond the more personal storyregardless of whether or not im writing the dialog or text myself for other games or for sekiro im still open to receive suggestions and ideas from any and all member of staff as long as these are good ideas and easy to digest then im willing to incorporate them this isnt something that just applies to sekiro this is the way ive been working with the story and the narrative throughout the games ive producedcongratulations recently on the lifetime achievement award very exciting for people out there do you have any tips for how to lead a successful life what are the keys to leading a successful lifethats very difficult im not in a position to tell people how to lead their lives theyve got to do whats best for them personally ive worked in the games industry just over ten years and ive just enjoyed making these games when im asked what especially has been good about that or what do i put value in there then theres nothing particular to say its just the fact that whether or not they succeed its just the fact that im making these games and i enjoy that processits so difficult i just want to say lets all just love one another and make world peace but its not as easy as that especially when im making games like dark souls and sekiro but as long as ive contributed something thats had an impact on someones life thats enough for me receiving this award i was very humbled now that you bring it up it reminded me to appreciate the people who are playing the games and who were giving us these great vibes because theyre the ones whove kind of cultivated us and our way of life and our culture and the way we make games and what we want to give back to them so again receiving that award i was like wow this is something ive got to tell them i have to be more appreciative of this im not one of those people who goes on amazon and writes reviews for games and stuff like that but i might be turning into one of those people ive got to show a little bit of love here and therefor the players amazon for the playersfor the developers as welleverybody in the worldyou know just as a private user not miyazaki just to add to the good vibes ill do my best to give that positive vibeget a nice little message at the end of the credits just sekiro go out and love each other and make world peaceno ones going to buy thatany chance of a demons souls remaster after we had the dark souls remasteredi dont think the possibility is zero but personally its not something that id be interested in doing personally its like when you write when youre younger you look back on it and you think oh goodness what was i thinking its not that im embarrassed i just dont like to look at my previous works its the same with dark souls remastered this wasnt my own idea so youd have to ask sony but i dont think that the possibility is zero youd have to see what theyre thinking about it but details i have nothingjust for you guys to bring it up makes me really happy because that was the first action fantasy game that i created or i directed i have fond memories of it but its definitely not my place to say theyll remasteryoud be comfortable with another studio working on it in theory if somebody were to remaster ityou know if it was a studio that really loved the original work and really put their heart and soul into realizing it again then thats something i would enjoy but its really complicated because i have these fond memories but thinking about the idea of a remaster gives me kind of butterflies in my stomach and makes me a little nervous so its complicated but i understand there are many users and many players and fans out there who really love demons so if thats something they could accomplish with a studio that loved the work then yeah id be okay with thatfor more on sekiro shadows die

Storytelling For Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice,set in the waning years of sengokuera japan sekiro shadows die twice features a brighter more colorful world than weve seen out of from software this lets them create environments with a different air about them than either bloodborne or dark souls as the developer tries to both elicit and play with the beauty of japan during the warring states period the change in locale has also prompted from software to make some key changes to how it tells stories but its not shying away from the key methods fans have come to lovefor starters dont let the brighter environments in sekiro fool you into thinking this will be a cheerier tale of course this being a from title theres beauty and theres death and decay to contrast that says from manager of marketing and communications yasuhiro kitao when choosing a time period for sekiro from chose the earlier sengoku era over the more modern edo period as its setting specifically because it fit the studios style edo is more like japan coming back from the brink and really kind of revitalizing itself and everythings a lot more earlymodern stuff kitao says sengoku is much like dark souls and such more medieval japan and allows us to play with those medieval concepts and those more mystical conceptsthe company has taken inspiration from history before the company looked to victorian london when making bloodborne and you can expect a similar approach to japan in sekiro we decided to take inspiration from the architecture and the vegetation but there are no actual historical people or locations featured in the game kitao says this is a from game were talking about its a miyazaki game were talking about you can probably expect a lot of weirdness to occur and to begin to unravel as you progress through the gamewith its move away from rpg builds and progression from is also leaning into telling the story of a set character rather than letting players create their own previous from games told the story of their worlds moreso than any individual character delving into the history of the locations you traversed and telling stories of characters whose footsteps you were following while your character in those games set important events in motion you were only one small part of a grander tale this time we have a fixed protagonist and we have a cast of characters who were trying to build that story around kitao says were trying to tell more of a drama if you will of these charactersthe story of sekiro begins with the young lord a child the wolf is in charge of protecting early in the game the wolf and the young lord are assaulted by a group of enemies led by the ashina commander who defeats the wolf chops off his arm and kidnaps the young lord after finding himself restored to health after the battle and wearing a prosthetic limb the wolfs goal at the start of shadows die twice is to find and retrieve the young lord and exact revenge on his assailantone nice thing about basing the story around these characters is we get to play with the relationship between these characters between the wolf and the young lord and how their relationship kind of evolves throughout the game kitao says the young lord and the wolf will meet up several times throughout the story and the story will place a large emphasis on their relationship there is one point in the early game where he is by your side but this is not a kind of escort mission in the typical sense and it only happens the one timethe wolf is also a more fleshedout character than the player characters in other from games raised on the battlefield by a character named the owl the wolf will speak to other characters as he encounters them lending his own character to the story having this key protagonist allows us to build a cast of characters around him and his personality and his history says director hidetaka miyazaki we feel like you know not the typical npcs that you run into during the game but these kind of central these core characters that are central to his presence in the world and his story are going to be playing a lot of that role of the story in the gameplay so we feel like youll be able to experience both his past in that sense and the hereandnow of where the game takes placethe main area we played through the hirata estates was couched in the story as a flashback in which the wolf fights against lady butterfly an acquaintance of the owl he sort of plays a foster father role to the protagonist miyazaki says this owl character picked up sekiro on the battlefield and raised him as a shinobi and one of his old acquaintances or part of that shinobi system of allies was this lady butterfly character so while owl was training the protagonist and teaching him techniques maybe he got to spar with this character or had some sort of menial relationship with her through the fosterfather figurefrom isnt going to lean too heavily on flashbacks to tell its story however its mainly focused on the present miyazaki says its not a game where youre going back and forth from present to past to piece together the puzzle but this is a oneoff flash back if you will to a portion of his past and that allows you to piece a little more bits together of the story so you get some extra detail and you can flesh things out for yourself in that waywhile this more character and narrativecentric approach is atypical for from kitao is confident with how the change in direction is taking shape it actually a very way of doing a protagonist and the way he conducts himself and the way this character kind of evolves is very kind of fromesque he says although hell have a central role in the story dont expect sekiro to be a chatterbox he say a few things here and there but yeah he won bore you to tears with constant monologues kitao saysat first this characterdriven approach seems to clash with one of froms signature storytelling techniques foregoing a traditional narrative in favor of having players build their own narrative out of vague hints from characters and item descriptions from is well aware of fans love of that technique and wants to assure them what while the story theyre telling is angled differently the methodology isnt changing too much that is very much intact in sekiro were trying to maintain that kitao says we don want to rob the experience of that kind of fragmented storytelling we want it to be a userdriven story a playdriven experience rather than something directed by us we don want to feed the user every little bit of information we don want to tell them straightup the answers or how something is we like them to experience and explore that for themselveswe found plenty of items during our time with sekiro and of course the descriptions for these items were more than just functional the description for the fistful of ash item for example states it can be thrown to distract enemies but also mentions that doing exactly that was a hobby of boys growing up in ashina the locale in which the wolf was raised as we approached a particular area we also saw a scene of the young lord chatting with emma one of the characters who helps you in sekiros hub area play out through ghostly figures in the environment itself similar to how certain flashbacks in games like bioshock occur however kitao says the number of cutscenes in sekiro wont be out of line with the companys past work and that they wont have huge info dumps either we want users to pick up on these subtle hints through the cutscenes through the dialogue as wellthat said from is making some changes to this storytelling approach namely whos doing the telling although miyazaki is handling the overall story he wont be doing the bulk of the writing for the dialogue and item descriptions delegating the job to other members of the staff to create a fresh experience and something that we hope users have never seen before kitao says miyazaki himself doesnt want to fall back into his old writing tricks either something he feels fans wouldnt be as excited about as they have been in the pastwhile miyazaki finds the change refreshing in some ways its meant getting used to a change in the overall narrative workflow previously i could have just written some stuff down as part of the text or dialog at home miyazaki says nowadays for sekiro i have to communicate this to staff and be really quite forthcoming about it thats quite tough in itself but then to see them reinterpret this into their idea of what that means or that implies this is enlightening for me and it allows me to see this different interpretation and then to have this collaborative story building together this in turn gives miyazaki the ability to see the story from is building from a new perspective and for the first time get a read on how coherent it might be to an outside readersekiro shadows die twice makes a number of tweaks to how from software tells stories but from the time weve spent with it it looks to stay true to the companys mantra of letting players engage with their stories in various engaging ways even as it aims to tell a more personal talefor

making a number of changes to the way it thinks about combat level design storytelling and more although fans expect plenty of surprises when they sit down with a from game for the first time certain aspects of the developers formula having been trained into players minds and it might be these players who have the hardest time getting used to sekiros changesto get a taste of how sekiro might differ from froms previous output we sat down with lead game planner masaru yamamura to get his insight on what learned players may want to rethink most when they jump into sengokuera japan for the first timefor years fans of from games have learned an invaluable instinct if you see your opponent wind up an attack get out of the way that will only get you so far in sekiro and yamamura predicts some players are going to think the game is harder than it actually is if they dodge at the first sign of movement we feel like the initial impression is going to be wow these enemies are really tough they have a strong defense he sayscombat works a little differently this time around when you see an attack come your way thats your time to strike when the enemys attacking you you can deal damage to them you can wear down their posture by deflecting their momentum and their attacks yamamura says most attacks enemies dish out can be can be countered by your own sword swings dealing damage but more importantly increase their posture meter when this meter maxes out theyre vulnerable to death blows which will deal severe damage usually killing themits not simply a matter of mashing the attack button instead of the roll button though the window for properly deflecting an attack is fairly thin so youll have to study an opponents attacks and learn the proper timing to counter them once users have mastered the deflect technique theyll be dealing not only damage through their own attacks but when theyre being attacked by the enemies turning that to their advantage yamamura saysbefore you engage in combat at all however youll want to do your research the wolfs grappling hook lets him move to high places and get a view of where hes fighting this lets you survey your opponents before you fight them make it a point to seek out vantage points where youll be able to see what youre up against and plan accordinglyon the ground youll want to be sneaky though past from games let you get the jump on enemies from time to time sekiro has a bona fide stealth option letting you move slowly and hide in tall grass to avoid detection this serves two functions first if you can take out a few of the more isolated enemies before youre spotted youll have an easier time once you go loud second if enemies dont know youre there they might be a little chattier and have conversations that might be of use to you it also helps to talk to anyone else you meet along the way the eavesdropping mechanic conversations with npcs overhearing enemy conversations these are ways you can learn about the world and gain hints about combat as well yamamura says if you overhear enemy conversations before you kill them you might learn a particular enemy is weak to fire giving you an advantage when you finally face themin sekiro every player plays by the same rules by giving every player the same toolset from can create encounters that may require a specific approach attack or tool and trust that players will have that solution at the ready the game is designed in a way that wed like users to experience all these options yamamura says and to incorporate them all into their toolset and to take on challenges by thinking what could i take from my repertoire in this situation how could i apply that hereif youre finding a particular encounter or boss too difficult think about all of the tools at your disposal between your katana prosthetic limb weapons and tools and stealth or traversal options you probably have an answer for your problem if not it might be time to go look for it as some options are hidden around the world either way youre never locked out of a certain strategy simply because you didnt build for itsekiro isnt as malleable a game when it comes to creating different character builds that means some dedicated from players are going to have their gameplans pulled out from underneath them but are there ways to make the wolf your own that let you adapt to different encountersyamamura says the biggest way players most comfortable with heavy weapons bows or magic will find some comfort in sekiros combat arts equippable skills that offer new abilities if a user wants to use a particularly heavy slow attack then theyll find something in the combat arts he says meanwhile the prosthetic tools have a variety of more i suppose martial arts or ninjutsubased attacks that could be perceived as magic as wellso while you wont be able to turn yourself into an unstoppable heavyroller or keepaway mage players with different tastes should look into how they can create their own comfortable build through the combat arts rather than having to return to a particular character to respect their stat pointsfor more on sekiro shadows die twice make sure to check

cars for newcomers too let break down everything show in itthis is the main hub of gran turismo and it where you access the game cars racing locations and layouts yamauchi says more cars and layouts will be added in future online updates too the world map is essentially a birdseye view of the smaller hubs within such as the used car dealer the cafe legendary cars and morewhen you begin the game

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/02/gran-turismo-7-preview-drivin-solo,Gran Turismo 7 Preview – Drivin’ Solo,gran turismo sport was released in and although some aspects earned praise it left fans wanting more while also exciting them about whats to come in the next game the dna of sport which was mostly focused on competitive multiplayer seems to be present in but after previewing the game its clear that this sequel offers so much moreand thats exciting for someone like me who has never really made it beyond a few hours into a gran turismo game i went into this preview looking for reasons to be excited for polyphony digitals latest love letter to cars and came away with enough to feel like is worth checking outlet me get this out of the way right up front if youre a gt fan you are in for a treat with it features more than cars locations layouts more than racing events over aerodynamic parts types of wheels colors of measured paint data and so much more all the bells and whistles are here and of course theyve never looked better thanks to the playstation plus the haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are sure to make races through trial mountain deep forest and daytona more immersive than ever before producer kazunori yamauchi says these additions will make it feel like youre holding a car in your hands with the track beneath youhowever this preview revealed to me that is more than just the real driving simulator its a love letter to car culture and a set of welcoming arms for newcomers like mebeyond classic gt showcase features like replay and showrooms for new used and legendary cars alike features multiple museumlike functions that have me intrigued when you go to the brand central hub which is found on the new world map youll discover more than cars from and later from over different worldwide brands like ford nissan suzuki and othersthis is standard fare for a gt game but whats new is that each car manufacturer has a detailed history available for viewing here youll learn about the brands creator its history through time some of its most standout vehicles and where the company stands in the industry today as someone whos always admired the culture surrounding cars but has never dabbled in it im excited to catch up on the automobile history fans of gt likely already knowtheres also the new cafe here youll view a cafe menu but instead of espresso drinks and pastries youll find a variety of cars each is essentially a mission where you must complete all of the races and events for a particular cars menu yamauchi says there are over to complete and that doing so will get the credits rolling the cafe is your guide through campaign although yamauchi says rolling credits is just the beginning as someone looking to give their first gt game a real go having easytounderstand objectives like this to reach the credits excites me sure i can tinker with hundreds of settings and tunings and race realworld players but if im looking for something more focused and straightforward the cafe seems to scratch that itchthe other new exciting feature in that promises to onboard newcomers is the music rally yamauchi described this mode as one not for driving but for enjoying music ive always admired gran turismo soundtracks and seeing a mode that prioritizes polyphony digitals excellent taste in music is a welcome addition in music rally you begin with a set number of beats when the race begins the beats decrease and when they run out the race ends however if you go through the tracks checkpoints youll earn more points ideally you do well enough to finish the song and the race it looks decidedly slower than a standard gt race too and the focus is more about enjoying the ride rather than beating this driver or that onewith a soundtrack boasting popular hits from genres ranging from jazz to lounge to hiphop to rock i have a feeling music rally is going to be my goto mode when im looking to relax behind a steering wheel at the end of my day driving around and listening to music is already one of my favorite things to do in real life and it seems im not alone if music rallys inclusion in is any impressive photo mode looks to be the most advanced ever in a firstparty playstation game it has dozens of settings to tinker with and a scrapes mode that allows you to place any of your cars within one of over different backdrops as someone who spends at least of any play session they have in a given games photo mode i already know im going to lose plenty of hours in scrapes moreover the game features a raytracing mode for scrapes photo mode and replay making the prospect of what my digital screenshot library will be all the more excitingi left the preview more amped to check out gran turismo in march than i ever felt possible yamauchi placed a particular emphasis on polyphony digitals desire to welcome newcomers to the franchise with open arms in which spoke directly to me modes like cafe and music rally ensure ill be checking it out at launch still im nervous that after a dozen or so hours with the game the fun and easygoing nature of these modes will grow stale forcing me to dive further into the more hardcore madeforfans modes that require a keen eye for vehicle tunings and other nuances its then that might lose me but who knows perhaps the likes of cafe music rally and the games museum features will entice me enough that when its time to dive into gran turismo more competitive destinations ill be ready to trade out my training wheels for a

Goblins,ghosts n goblins resurrection is out soon giving fans of capcoms toughasnails platformer an excuse to suit up again its not a remake of the arcade original its sequel or various console ports instead its a greathomage to those classics drawing heavily from what made them so memorable while providing an allnew experience in other words youre getting a new experience whether youre a hardcore fan or someone whos completely new to the series on the eve of its release we spoke with series director tokuro fujiwara and chief producer yoshiaki hirabayashi about the original games and their notorious difficulty what it was like to revisit the series and what players can expect from resurrectionmany of us remember playing ghosts n goblins at home on our nes consoles but it was released a year before in arcades arcade games could certainly be mastered but lets be honest those cabinets werent installed from a place of charity if you could design a game that maintained player interest while also threading the needle in terms of difficulty you could have something that would get players reaching into their pockets after a game over instead of looking around for something else to play its easy to assume that ghosts n goblins was designed to drain quarters from players particularly since it required two complete playthroughs to see the true ending fujiwara says that isnt the case howeverwhen developing the original ghosts n goblins i struggled to figure out how players could enjoy this game as an arcade title he says i never wanted to intentionally make it difficult or give a long journey in the form of a second playthrough just to get players to drop more coins my aim was to determine how to deliver the sense of accomplishment and satisfaction within the play time from one coin the was merely the end result regardless of what generation or platform this is for i think most people including myself feel that a challenge that leads to a sense of accomplishment is fun and worth taking onwhen capcom ported the game to the nes they didnt hold back either i think most people believe the arcade and nes versions have the same difficulty but in reality they are different fujiwara says the arcade version had a reputation for being difficult but there was a demand to make the nes version even harder since it was thought the game would be too easy for those who already played it at the arcade we thought ok lets make it a little harder but as we made further and further adjustments it ended up becoming the hardest game in the series to this day i dont even have the confidence to beat the nes version of ghosts n goblins but if you have the chance please give it a shot and experience the ultimate difficultyghosts n goblins resurrection posed a different kind of challenge so to speak the developers wanted to respect the original games that were created years ago but also were eager to give fans something new that leads to a larger question of what the hallmark elements were that made a ghost n goblins game a ghost n goblins gamefirstly i wanted to present the hallmarks that have been important throughout the ghosts n goblins series fujiwara says the first is the sense of achievement players feel taking on a new challenge and the second is a horror theme park aesthetic that inspired the stages and visuals in the game these two concepts have always been essential to the series and weve incorporated new ideas in order to achieve this in ghosts n goblins resurrection i didnt start off thinking that i had to incorporate something new and novel because its a new title instead i looked for ways to cherish and simultaneously renew the essence of this ipthat meant infusing the platformer with elements that have become more commonplace in contemporary games updates include a new magic system where players can collect umbral bees in the world and unlock spells that turn enemies into frogs tear into foes with lightning and other powerful abilities considering how easy it is to get your armor knocked off and turn into a pile of skeletonized remains any help is welcomethe task of updating the franchise was daunting hirabayashi says getting handed the baton for an ip that has such a rich beloved history of years was both an honor and simultaneously intimidating in order for me to deliver this title i truly had to understand the history and the love fans have toward this series this made me realize i had to ensure this title would respect the memories fans have of this ip which made me even more nervous hahathe inclusion of magic spells is certainly a flashy change from older games but its not the most meaningful because of the original games difficulty reaching the true ending was an achievement for those who were able to meet the challenge it was a testament to their perseverance and skill and for everyone else it was probably a disappointment and a reminder of their gaming mortality with resurrection the team wanted as many people as possible to be able to fully appreciate their hard work that meant revisiting the concept of difficultyfujiwarasan suggested having multiple difficulty modes early on in the development phase and i immediately agreed to this hirabayashi says he explained his vision on what this would look like and i was able to think about it and see how this would fit within the ghosts n goblins series since the level of proficiency is so different between players and because everyone has their unique relationship to the ip we decided to incorporate multiple difficulty modes so that each person can achieve their own sense of accomplishmentour intention wasnt to simply provide an easier experience of something difficult rather we wanted to provide an experience that matches each players proficiency to allow them to reach that sense of accomplishment that has been the core of the ghosts n goblins series since its origins it would make us happy if youre able to find the optimal difficulty mode that fits your playstyle in order for you to find this weve provided short messages that appear when selecting between difficulty modes for hardcore fans and experienced players we

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/15/how-a-community-creator-helped-completely-revamp-fortnites-gyro-aiming-controls,How A Community Creator Helped Completely Revamp Fortnite's Gyro Aiming Controls,shoot your shot is something you hear often and doing it can be pretty scary still for julian jibb smart a video game input specialist it helped him land the project of a lifetime develop an entirely new gyro aiming control system for one of the biggest games in the world fortnite simply put smart shot his shot he emailed epic games and essentially said your gyro systems are great but they can be better and i know howit was a bold statement you see epic games created the most famous battle royale in recent memory further augmented by a highly successful online storefront moreover the company developed unreal engine one of the world mostused video game engines but when you know something well and you can back it up a shot like this is worth the effort and perhaps to smarts surprise epic responded positively saying lets do itso smart began implementing a new and improved gyro aiming system for fortnite on playstation consoles switch pc and android and added officiallysanctioned controls for his creation flick stick features that are now live in the game as of today we spoke to smart about how development went what its like for him to see his passion project in fortnite and why gyro aiming and additional options like flick stick are not just a win for advancedlevel fortnite players but a triumph for accessibility initiatives toothis has been super exciting smart says it feels like its been this fouryear journey and this is just the biggest step in it one thing we talk about in the gyro communityis whats it going to take for this stuff to take hold across video games for there to be an impact and its going to be a huge game its going to be a game where controls really matter to playersthat game needed to be something as big as fortnite it doesnt hurt that fortnite is where smarts gyro goals landed and now the oneperson developer is beyond excited to see if gyros like this take off in other massive titles introducing additional controls and options in a game is never a bad idea because it makes playing games more accessible for everyonesmarts interest in gyro input took off following the release of nintendos splatoon a thirdperson shooter whose primary aim mechanic uses gyro controls back then smart was dying to get his hands on splatoon because it was unique for a developer as prominent as nintendo to default to gyro aiming he always knew that adding gyro to a players toolset increased precision and accuracy splatoon was a perfect proof of conceptsmart would begin developing new input controls and options as a side gighobby after splatoons release he eventually fell in love with the gyro communityi will learn how to do gyro controls well smart recalls telling himself and then i can create resources i can tell other developers and players with authority this is how easy or hard it is this is what you need to do lets just do it so i made an opensource input called joyshockmapperfrom there smart created a youtube channel to show people how to do what he was doing he also made a website called gyrowiki a trove of resources on how to implement good gyro controls things took off from there and soon smart became a wellknown figure in the gyro input communityfast forward a couple of years and today things are finally official smartsgyro input system is currently available in fortnite smart recognizes that many developers are doing their best to put gyro controls in their games but like with most anything you can end up with a halfbaked version without a specialists helptheyre doing the best they can to give other people the controls they want but theyre not as good as they could be smart says there are a few different things that almost every game fumbles on and one of those thats really important to me is a player having the ability to turn off the gyro controls at any momentlast week that wasnt possible in fortnite today it is a quick glance through the latest blog post about fortnites new gyro options reveals just how much more customizable gyro controls are in the battle royalewith fortnite what ive really appreciated is the understanding that if these controls benefit people we should make sure people know about it and if people dont know yet that theyll benefit from our controls we should make sure they know about doing it smart says leading up to the release of this update i see epic really getting behind this feature and going how are we going to make sure as many people experience this as possible how are we doing to make sure people see the potential and just give it a good go and if its not for them its not for them i wont speak on behalf of everyone but i think most players will benefit from gyro controlssmart says that it can take some time to get used to it though its a brand new way to handle aiming in a fastpaced battle royale after all but he also says that some players pick up on it quickly and once you get used to it going back can feel like losing a good chunk of precision from your playstyle that extra precision is why gyro aiming is such a boon to professional players or even those who simply want to take their gameplay to the next levelexperienced players obviously benefit from that precise directness of control smart says there are far better players than i am who are able to pull off moves where people watching go that must be a mouse and keyboard player but its not thanks to gyro control precision mimics the same high level of precision seen on mouse and keyboard to raise that skill ceiling to have that precision that means we do away with aim assist thoughif you have gyro controls disabled aim assist will remain if you have gyro enabled aim assist is disabled and smart says that makes things fair gyro aiming plus aim assist would be unfair especially for highskilled playersbeyond offering additional options for professionallevel players smarts new gyro options also greatly benefit the accessibility of fortniteits been really cool to work with players who whether its due to injuries or a temporary disability or whether its a more longterm disability cannot play games with a standard controller smart says these gyro options might allow them to play i have received a lot of feedback in that regard and its been really encouraging to get into accessibility its not one size fits all and so the only way to meet everyones needs is to supply the options to cover everyones needssmart believes new options like this are a step in that direction the push for accessibility in gaming especially over the last couple of years has been encouraging inspiring him to continue advocating for gyro input in games hell also continue to support the flick stick which allows players to make quick movements and turnarounds too as it helps both prolevel players and enriches the overall accessibility of fortniteits so awesome smart says when asked what its like seeing his own flick stick as an official option in fortnite its so cool its been my hope from the beginning to share this information with the world and see that games can run away with it now im paid to do this stuff in one of the biggest games in the world and to see that feature i came up with even just as a nameits unreal and thats super lame because its a pun epic develops unreal engine but its totally spoton this really is a dreamlike experience seeing my feature come to the world in this waynow that these features are live in fortnite smart would like to give a massive shout out to the entire gyro gaming communitytheyve been incredibly helpful along the way with feedback contributing code to joyshockmapper and other opensource projects helping folks out and motivating me to keep pushing to change how games are playedhe also wants to give a hearty shout out to epic games for the opportunity and the help in developing these new options alongside himfor more about these new gyro options in fortnite

six years after its launch but thats not the only ubisoft title still pulling back players in for more for honor recently celebrated its fourth birthday and the company revealed whats ahead for the game as part of its year update shovel knight cosmetics i havent played much of the melee fighter since i reviewed it back in which made me wonder what its like to jump back in after all new heroes and maps have been released over the years along with balance changes and tweaks to the overall meta the bottom line its still fun but get used to dyingubisoft was kind enough to loan me three members of the for honor team to get me back up to speed before i joined the session i went back through the tutorials and reacclimated myself to the combat basics if you havent played for honor its simultaneously simple and complex characters hold their weapons in three different stances up left and right if your stance matches that of an incoming attack youll block it if you attack in a direction that an opponent hasnt picked surprise your attack will land there are combos to master unblockable moves to learn special attacks weapon and armor unlocks strategies that vary depending on maps and game modes its a lotfor honors strength is its very unique gameplay experience and even though its quite simple to get used to the art of battle understanding all the intricacies of each hero and match ups can take a bit more time says game director nicolas bombray on the upside though the community has put up a lot of useful videos and tutorials online about many aspects of the game so if you want to get serious about for honor you should definitely check that material outi selected warmonger one of the characters introduced since i last played shes a visually intimidating member of the knight faction who wields a twohanded flamberge she has great range and her combos include poking attacks and sweeping strikes she also has a cool guardbreak variation that is a nice departure from the other heroes if you charge it in the middle of several different combos she lashes out with a clawed gauntlet based on aesthetics alone i was all inright off the bat players are going to notice the hero roster has expanded greatly says lead game designer stefan jewinski when for honor first launched it had heroes now we have and more coming in year year heroes the warmonger and gryphon are built with accessible gameplay in mind if you are a new or returning player these are effective heroes that are easy to pick up and be able to start playing well with at the same time because of hero reworks core combat updates and various improvements over the years the general hero balance across the board is better than ever so whoever you pick youre going to be able to wreak some havoc on the battlefieldwe played three matches of dominion which is essentially a zonebased mode where two teams of four players try to control several strategic points in an arena you score by capturing control points killing enemy heroes and killing fodder ai that typically gathers in the center of each map when you reach points the other team breaks preventing them from respawning kill all four heroes at that point and you win its basically for honors flagship mode and it seemed like as good a place as any to dip my toes inif youre a person who gets frustrated easily in multiplayer games you may want to practice your deepbreathing exercises before playing for honor i dont know if it was a matter of luck or lack thereof matchmaking or just my waning muscle memory but my return to the battlefield was a brutal reminder that a lot of players havent stopped playing the game i found myself easily outclassed in oneonone battles and in the rare moments where it seemed as though i was gaining the upper hand my opponents teammate would materialize from nowhere and gank me my death usually displayed with a gruesome demoralizing executionof course the most experienced players are masters these days but our skillbased matchmaking should ensure that all players get generally fair matchups and generally keep those masters away from players who are working their way up the skill curve jewinsky says i may have been a victim of ubisofts generosity i didnt look too closely at my teammates stats but theres a distinct possibility that their presence tipped the scales against a novice like me i tried a few matches later in solo queue and sure enough it didnt feel like i was battling superhuman opponentseven though i died often and reliably there were some changes to the ui designed to help coordinate team play i didnt notice it at first but i appreciated the team id overlay that helps you differentiate teammates from enemies while on the battlefield this makes it easy to see at a glance where everyone is and more importantly where they need to bedespite some of the veinbursting frustration that came with my short lifespans i had a pretty good time getting back into the action its satisfying to land a combo particularly when youre able to skewer an opponent who was bashing your head in mere moments ago and the inclusion of a battle pass gives players who like cosmetics something to shoot for or of course to spend money on if they so desire i didnt get on board with the cosmetics side of for honor in the beginning and i dont know that i ever will year collaboration with yacht club has led to some shovel knightthemed outfits and something called a shovel drop emote but i cant imagine a world where i drop any cash on itwould i recommend getting back into for honor if youre looking for weaponsbased fighting on console its among the best options ive played even with my rusty skills when it was released i spent a lot of time playing it for review and got into a nice groove the combat was satisfying and victories as hardfought as they were felt earned im certainly nowhere near that place right now but im tentatively putting it back on my rotation i imagine that getting proficient at it again has to feel great even if the path to get there is paved with whiffed attacks dead heroes and a demoralizing string of losses with mastery comes the possibility of earning a little cash toofor our more competitive audience last year we introduced the dominion series our official competitive program for pc top players with a total cash prize of jewinsky says we will keep running the dominion series during year and will communicate all the details in the near future we also have intentions to introduce more casual tournaments within the year to give a chance to less experienced players to participate here again more details will follow as the year unfoldsubisoft remains bullish on for honor even if it isnt grabbing as much mainstream attention as it did closer to its initial launch its clear that it still has a healthy fanbase the bulk of the matches i played filled up with live players in short order with only a few bots filling up vacancies when necessaryfor honors in the best shape its ever been bombray says we have heroes a more offensive meta and a booming competitive scene for the combat fans for those more attracted to the fantasy we have a lively platform that evolves every season and advances our narrative journey after the events of year we are now introducing the concept of covenants which will add a new spin to our classic factionsas far as the futures concerned weve recently added the ability for nextgen compatibility on playstation and xbox which is a great signal that we intend to keep for honor running long term playing the game at fps on console was a dream of ours for a long time and now its possible on nextgen consoles the future of for honor is constantly on our mind and we feel that even though theres never been a better time to play the game next season next year should be even better this is the reason why this team goes to work every morning this is a unique game defined by its very special core experience and we want to push it further using our competitive scene to keep learning improving the gameplay and promoting it to new players to keep growing this amazing community of

allstars crashed into public consciousness last june during sonys playstation event at the time of its bombastic reveal the carcombat title was set for a retail release around the thenupcoming consoles launch in october sony pumped the brakes announcing that the title was getting delayed to february to mitigate the sting the company said the game would be available at no extra charge for playstation plus subscribers hours from its worldwide launch we spoke with destruction allstars senior producer and director to learn about its oldschool roots onfoot action and how its treating cars like gunswhen we spoke the game was slowly coming to life on the other side of the globe players in new zealand were the first to be able to check out the game which has been an interesting experience for colin berry director at lucid games this is the first time ive launched a game and now theres somebody playing it live on twitch he says which is cool and exciting but ive described it as being a bit unnervingberry has been developing games for decades working on the wipeout series sonic allstars racing transformed and more he says geometry wars was the last game hes worked on that most people have heard of adding it was only maybe five or six years ago but the world was a different place back then he says the launch of the playstation portable game wipeout pure went well for example but that it essentially occurred in a vacuum i never actually got to see anyone playing it outside of because once its out you dont see people play your game only now you do and thats new to me youre more connected to the people who are playing your gameif things go according to plan there are going to be a lot of people playing destruction allstars its competitive nature was the impetus for the move away from a fullpriced retail game to a playstation plus release the reason for that was quite simply online multiplayer games need an audience says john mclaughlin senior producer at sony and to give the game the best audience possible was to put it into playstation plus playstation plus decisions are made way in advance so the earliest we could come out was february its a move that helped give titles like rocket league and fall guys an early boost and sony is hoping for a similar effect with destruction allstarsthe delay gave the developers time to ensure that its online tech was up to snuff theres a difference between launching when theres no consoles out there and having a very small audience and then coming a few months later when you have potentially millions of players on mclaughlin says we spent a lot of time on the back end working hard and making sure that everything goes as smoothly as it possibly canback in the playstation era carcombat games were fairly common in fact the original demo disc for the console featured playable demos for destruction derby and twisted metal there used to be a lot of these games of this type and then they just kind of seemed to dry up berry says its similar not just with the car arenacombat games but even with actionarcade racing games like the playstation playstation era of burnout and splitsecond and blur and thosearcade racers still come out from time to time but players who just want to smash cars together until they explode have fewer options and as berry points out those games dont stop being fun just because theyre not being made much anymorei can remember early on in our project i wont namecheck the guy because he wouldnt be happy but we have a concept artist who joined us fresh out of school a really good guy a really talented guy berry says he must be now so he was back when we first sort of started the project one of the references for one of the things that we were looking at i mentioned burnout and he was like ive ever played burnout i was like what it came out blah blah blah this year and he was like yeah i was four right that explains that berry says that exchange made him appreciate that his team would be bringing a genre to players who may not have had a chance to experience the satisfaction of crashing virtual cars togetherthe twist with destruction allstars is that you dont lose when your car is wrecked instead your character can continue on foot which is about as dangerous as it sounds in this game even though its car combat and its about smashing into each other and the cars are a really heavy focus the way we sort of think about it for our mentality is you are the character and the cars are your weapons berry says theyre disposable youre supposed to wreck them and cause damage youre supposed to get wrecked in years gone by its always been that thing of oh if i get wrecked ive lost or thats game over but its not you get wrecked and you come flying out of the car in an explosion of metal and wheels and bits of car and your character comes out and lands on the floor and bang they go and theyre offdestruction is obviously a huge part of the game as cars degrade and take damage they begin to perform more poorly as it turns out finding the balance for that aspect of the driving was a little tricky its mostly cosmetic and this was something that we deliberately tuned because we could have gone either way berry says because you can get out of the car at any point it became a question early on if we gimp your handling as soon as you get impacted youre just going to get out of that car and go and get another one and that means we end up with an arena littered with abandoned cars that are of no use to anybody and it means that wed probably get less spectacular wrecks because you take a bit of damage lose a wheel and then get out because the car feels really really gimpedon the flipside if we never reflect the damage in the handling and in the cars performance thats not going to feel completely right either because its going to feel like a little disconnect we tailor it so that as the car has taken quite extreme damage and its on its last legs say its last of health you can start to feel it pull to one side if its taken damage to one side or lost a wheel and you start to feel the bite on the accelerator on the adaptive triggers and also the brake they start to rattle and you can feel that your car has taken damage its going a little bit slower but not massively slower it was a conscious choice of wanting to reflect damage in the vehicle performance but we dont want to do it to a level where it becomes too much and the players just leave the car behinddestruction allstars is available february on

releases this week youd be forgiven if you missed young souls heres why you probably havent given it the time of day the game is a timed stadia exclusive don close thistabthegame is coming to other platforms this falli cant wait for that day to come because im several chapters into the game and having so much fun that im upset you can only play it on stadia right nowat its core young souls is a twoplayer beat em up in the vein of streets of rage or scott pilgrim vs the world its also got rpgstyle progression and a dungeoncrawling structure as two orphaned twins jen and tristan youre living a mundane life with your adopted father a kooky scientist in a small town what isn boring is that your father figure has been abducted by gobbons basically goblins and taken to a fantastical underground world since jen and tristan are rebellious teens theyre more than happy to pick up a sword and battle through floors of dungeons to rescue himyoung souls slick presentation was the first thing to win me over its animated construction paperish art looks awesome and i especially love its dramatic camera angles during cinematics its definitely one of those games that looks better in motion im also digging the writing due to their parentless upbringing jen and tristan have some issuesand have earned a reputation around town as known troublemakers their us against the world attitudes could have easily been grating but i find them endearing so far their conversations with other characters especially the gobbons have been lighthearted goofy and fun when theyre not ripping on the world or each other theyre pondering relatable issues like whether they feel comfortable calling the scientist their dad the grander story about the relationship between the human world and the goblin realm has also kept my interestas a brawler youre mashing light and heavy attacks that feel quite good to execute thanks to the satisfying weight behind them that doesn mean it deliberate action is fastpaced fluid and combofriendly but you also have to manage to dodge thanks to a stamina bar the twins are equipped with a shield used to block and parry attacks the latter of which opens up foes for a counterattack or better yet to be picked up and tossed into their allies young souls combat isnt breaking any new ground but its well designed and very fun smaller grunts and large bosses can be tougher than youd expect and that keeps the game from feeling too mindless as you have to stay on point in regards to knowing when to attack defend or tag outyes there are times when enemies arent lined up with your attacks in that beat em up sort of way but thats a legacy issue that i as a fan of the genre can tolerateso far young soulsplays like a dream is shaping up to be one of my favorite brawlers in recent memorythe game supports two players but im playing alone and still having a good time you can swap between each twin on the fly in solo play effectively giving you two health bars the partner thats tagged out gradually recovers health and when a twin goes down you can revive that sibling using the other jen and tristan each have a limited number of lives so its important to keep an eye on their health and implement constant tags during hectic situationsjen and tristan perform identically but you can differentiate them by upgrading their stats and equipping armor and weaponsin between nightly dungeon runs youll spend the day exploring the town to buy swanky outfits selling trinkets for cash and upgrading your base attributes by hitting the gym provided you have a special token completing simple exercise minigames like bench pressingor cycling can increase each twin strength endurance and stamina if youd rather have jen be faster and tristan be the heavy hitter you can do that or you can upgrade them equally do what works for youi have a long way to go and the game could always take a nosedive but i can confidently say that right now young souls is well worth a look thanks to its tightgameplay sharp writing and eyecatching presentation it much more than your standard beat upwhile its timed exclusivity is a good get for stadia it presents an unfortunate dilemma most people will likely pass on the game simply because stadia is well stadia when it does come to playstation xbox one switch and pc sometime this fall it may get lost in the shuffle of the big holiday releases right now is the perfect time for something like this to drop which makes it frustrating that its on a platform many people seem at best apathetic to and understandably so so if youre a stadia user or willing to give it a shot so far young souls has been one of the best reasons to fire it up in a long timeif comments are still showing as disabled a

Designer,dying light stay human was released on february to largely positive reviews and massiveplayer countnumbers especially compared to that of the first dying light it remains one of the highestscoring games game informer has reviewed this year receiving a out of and in less than hours after release dying light pc player count peak surpassed dying lights alltime high peakby all accounts dying light was a massive success for techland which had been working on the sequel for years getting to that success wasnt easy though after its indefinite delay back in the gamer released a new report that painted a picture of a lack of leadership a lack of direction and a demoralizing atmosphere at the studio less than a year prior the studio released a statement announcing it had parted ways with narrative designer chris avellone after allegations of sexual harassment surfacedwith the game now out and in the hands of players who will ideally for techland continue to play the game for at least the five years the studio has content planned for the zombie parkour title the team has crossed over from the nervous excitement and anticipation felt prelaunch into a state of elationi think everyone is really really happy that we were able to release the game dying light lead game designer tymon smektaatells game informer the game has been received very well we announced that during the first weekend it reached more than million players and that was an astonishing number as you can imagine the number is only growing and it has been a long journeysmektaa said dying light was a difficult project due to its sheer size and complexity not only was it a followup to the surprise hit dying light which has received support from techland for more than seven years but it needed to up the ante in every wayit really took the best of us but we are happy its out there and we are feeding on the positive feedback that the community is giving us smektaa sayshe said the team took its break following the launch but is now back to work on postlaunch content as mentioned above techland has a fiveyear postlaunch dlc plan for dying light but smektaa tells game informer that the team already has plans to create and add more content to that timeline than whats been announced it was never a question for techland to support this game for many years after its launch but the fiveyear number wasnt locked in until the end of last yearthere are a lot of reasons why we feel supporting the game extensively after launch is important smektaa says one of the reasons is that i think we have realized we have invented or maybe discovered a formula that actually being on good terms with your community and working with your community and supporting your communityis extremely beneficial to you as a game developer and as a publisher we are very lucky to be able to own dying light and develop dying light as our own intellectual property soboth sides of our organization are supported and get benefits from us supporting the game for so longwhen the team decided it would support dying light heavily after launch they felt frozen at times smektaa says but it was equally as encouraging because the team knew that if the content was there the community would show up just as they did with dying light it also encouraged techland to staff up which ultimately created a studio better prepared for the long viralridden road ahead of itwe have grown a lot as an organization and as a studio smektaa says we understand our craft better as a result but we have also invited a lot of new people to join our ranks people with expertise in experiences from different studios and different projects so i think we were and are better prepared to handle a bigger project like thiswith launch day behind them smektaa says the biggest surprise for techland was how quickly some players were able to put in and even hours of time into the game perhaps just as surprising were the requests for new content from those that played so much of dying light so quickly some of the biggest requests the team has heard include a new game plus mode a photo mode and additional tiers of difficultythose are definitely things that are on the table currently and that are being worked on he says i dont want to go into too many specifics herebut very soon people will start seeing those things being added in one form or another into the gameone challenge techland and ultimately every studio that finds success is facing with postlaunch plans is finding a way to satisfy not just this section of the player base or that but ideally every part of it smektaa says you have to think of everything and types of content that will satisfy the different needs of the entire very varied community thats what the next five years of dying light are about but right now techland is very focused on year onewe have already revealed a very highlevel roadmap for the first year but as players will soon discover we will add more to that firstyear roadmapand we will invite them to actually discover more content that will drop within the first year smektaa saysspeaking in broad strokes he says the first year of content will include some focus on online play some focus on singleplayer content and some on the games narrative other drops will be related to the games platforming elements like the new parkour trials recently added to the game in an update while others will be about the meleefocused combat smektaa hopes all of this and everything else planned for dying light is above all else surprising he likens the teams hopes for dlc to forrest gumps famous box of chocolates line in that ideally with dying light dlc you never know what youre going to getwe dont want to fall into this repeating pattern where players will kind of know what to expect from us he says having said that for example the first story dlc that we have promised ive seen a lot of speculation online about what it will be and i can say confidently that theywerent close to the markanyone thats completed dying light knows that its story concludes with some definitive choices those choices are up to the player of course but it leaves protagonist aiden and his allies and enemies in some interesting places especially when you consider where to go with story dlc the team is sidestepping that challenge for now by developing narrative content that happens sideways to the main eventsat some point we will actually start adding to the events that happened at the end of the game smektaa says we have some ideas on paper as they are implemented right now it seems promising but definitely this will be a challengedespite the challenges facing the team smektaa says the word hed use to describe what everyones feeling is excitement excitement that the game is out excitement that its resonated with fans and excitement about whats to come in dying light really just cant wait to see people that are interacting with this stuff and some of the ideas that we have because some of the things we are adding is simply put quite unique smektaa says some of it is us betting on ideas that are maybe a little out of the box well see what the community thinks but im feeling really positive about it all of this will unfold within the next as i said few weeks and will be in player hands within the next one to three months,en,475.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/10/where-is-our-lost-ark-review,Where Is Our Lost Ark Review?,lost ark launches for western audiences this week with its threeday early access event starting today amazon games the publisher bringing tripod studios and smilegate rpg to the west has been kind enough to let some of the press in a little early to play on a private server so i had my hands on the actionrpg mmo for a few weeks now much of the game was in place when i played although i was missing a very big aspect of itthe broader social component because of the small sample size of players all of my time in the world of arkesia was by my lonesome so for now i not comfortable dropping my final assessment on lost ark instead here are some of mythoughts on this impressive freetoplay title after playing prereleaseat launch lost ark features five broader class archetypes warrior martial artist gunner mage and assassin with total subclasses to choose from some only accessible depending on if you chose the male or female version of a class i spent my time split between the berserker and the sorceress both give a great first impression decked out with a handful of skills that showcasethe flavor of that class the berserker is a hulking warrior that carries a massive greatsword into battle to decimate everything in sight this class features a lot of upcloseandpersonal attacks like a shoulder charge leaping sword slashes whirlwind spins and a groundexploding aoemy sorceress a mage subclass utilizes the elements of water fire and ice among others to wash away torrents of foes in bloody heaps instead of having a dodge roll like the warrior the mage blinks a few feet in the desired direction adding a nice little touch to the class fantasy even after playing a class for hours on end seeing a crowd of thieves or monsters explode into gory gibs using what supposed to be an early game attack is surprising and fun unlocking more skills for both of my characters is always exciting and i can wait to check out even more classes when i start fresh with the upcoming launchclasses have plenty of customization in their sets of skills most fundamental is the configuration of your eight hotkey abilities these are selected from a pool of attacks and skills you learn as your character levels up stacked on top of that are skill points granted on level ups that you can feed into each skill unlocking perks that can modify that given skill these perks can tack on additional burn damage to a firebased attack change the mana cost of an ability or reduce cooldown times significantly you can really make each character your own and heavily tailor these moves to fit your preferred playstyle the system is super flexible and i loved toying with various builds to see how efficiently and stylishly i can wreak havoc on my enemies of course you also be swapping out sets of armor and weapons as you loot countless items throughout the adventure adding another layer to building your charactermovement and combat feel weighty and satisfying even when i on the receiving end of a strong enemy attackand sent tumbling to the ground there a need to be proactive about positioning and knowing where to approach from that not present in other arpgs you need to avoid attacks from stronger mobs to stay on your feet and knowing the tools you have at your disposal is key it crucial to pay attention to enemy signals and use a dodge roll to escape an aoe attack or crippling blow it fun knowing my character while super deadly is also venerable if i not paying attention to my surroundingslet get the cat out of the bag now lost ark is a freetoplay game supported mainly by a microtransaction model things you buy with real money include additional character slots pets mounts and cosmetics among other things some of these items have bonuses attached like the crystalline aura which doesn boost any character stats but reduces cooldowns on certain tasks and noncombat abilities pets purchased from the shop grant a very small chance to improve the rewards you get on specific kinds of quests is it pay to win not exactly i probably not going to spend money on items that speed up my progress but it doesn affect me if other people do still it good to keep in mind that these items exist and are for sale in the mtx shopi not enthralled in lost ark narrative which early on has me traveling from region to region across the lands of arkesia battling demonic forces and more to retrieve a magical item called an ark my relatively short time in search of this ark has taken me to quaint tutorial towns plagueriddled encampments and barren salt plains most characters are relegated to quest givers but some folks have relationship side quests you can build rapport with them by completing tasks giving gifts or playing music for them i haven seen a real payoff for this yet but i happy to have found some way to attach to the locals i come acrosseach map is unique and fun to quest through and explore my favorite parts have been hunting down hidden dungeons with treasure maps and elite monsters to score more powerful loot delving into bigger instanced dungeons provides the most significant challenge allowing for matchmaking with other adventurers and multiple difficulty options because i was never able to party up with anyone i took on these challenges solo i happy to report that even on a dungeon harder difficulty that garner sweeter rewardsi could complete them on my own though it does take more tact and skill dungeons are also where you find the most dynamic moments in lost ark events may cause the typically isometric camera to pan and sweep in cinematic ways allowing you to see more of the wondrous environmentsi was blown away by the submerged ruins the first real multibossed dungeon that felt like a proper adventure as i descended into its depths and faced the challenges inside i had to drain the flooded floors below to continue onward each encounter posed a significant challenge i was on hard mode so your mileagemay vary and the ratcheting tension had me on the edge of my seat until i defeated the final boss if more of the instanced encounters function this way i be in for a good timelost ark has a lot of collectibles to find and tons of boxes to check in every continent around the world every area has monsters to slay dungeons to find and world bosses to confront searching every nook and cranny is full of precious mokoko seeds giant hearts or parts of a stolen masterpiece progress made in these various collections and lists reward items like health potions cosmetics or cards those cards are also found by completing quests or are dropped from monsters in the wild and they can be equipped in a deck of up to six cards that add stat buffs and elemental resistances to your character luckily as far as i can tell all of these collectibles of which there are well over are shared accountwide making collecting a team effort with your other characterslike collectibles your roster level is shared across characters increasing stats like intelligence strength and dexterity for all of your characters little touches like these make me feel alright with having multiple alts in lost ark while i have to follow the same main story for each new class at least i have immediate benefits thanks to the work i done elsewhere it a small way to show that the game and devs respect my time and i appreciate not having to scour the lands for every mokoko seed every time i want to rerolli excited to see what lost ark offers when the servers are live and i can jump in and adventure with my friends there a lot of promise in this mmo but playing in a private setting felt like i was missing a key part of the experience although from what i have played i recommend trying lost ark out if you into actionheavy dungeon crawlers like diablo it certainly scratching that particular itch for me and there a ton of content in there that can be accessed without dropping any cash lost ark launches in full on pc on february but can be played starting today for those who purchase the founders pack or higher,en,374.0,Positive

Best Look Yet At What This Game Actually Is,nintendo and the pokmon company have released a new gameplay preview trailer for pokmon legends arceus and its a look at what well actually be doing in the game when it launches on january offers the best look yet at this new take on the pokmon formula which is especially exciting because as of late nintendo has been churning out trailer after trailer showcasing essentially the same content not to mention no official public handson previews have happened for this game so we dont even know what playing arceus feels like however todays gameplay preview video provides some answers to a lot of the questions we hadthe trailer doubles down on the openhub nature of the hisui region citing that each biome has different pokmon to catch terrain to traverse and raw materials to gather these raw materials can be used to craft items such as healing items lures smoke bombs pok balls and more and the narrator says your pokmon can help you find these materials toodifferent pokmon appear based on the time of the day and weather conditions plus different species have different temperaments some are skittish and might run away others are aggressiveif a pokmon detects you it will be in an alert state and it will deflect all pok balls you throw at it in order to catch an alert pokmon youll need to battle it with one of your ownyou candistract pokmon with things like food too also if you encounter aggressive pokmon they might immediately attack you and if you take too much damage youll blackout and lose some of the items you were carryingas part of the survey corps your job is to fill out the pokdex this doesnt just consist of catching pokmon that will only get some of the survey report filled out youll need to witness them doing certain moves or observe them at different parts of the day to learn more about the species and ultimately complete their pokdex entrybecause of how large the hisui region is youll have access to special blessed pokmon that you can ride on for example you can ride wyrdeer to navigate land faster but you can also immediately hop onto the back of a hisuian braviary to fly through the skies omega ruby and alpha sapphirestyle basculegion lets you skim through the rivers and seas of the hisui region toojubilife village is the center of operations for the galaxy expeditions team which is a group of people who have set up camp in the hisui region to learn about it and the pokmon within theyre made up of the survey corps security corps and medical corps jubilife is your home base and its here youll collect tasks and turn in completed ones you can also purchase crafted items and clothes here and trade pokmon with other players here toopart of the gameplay loop of arceus is completing missions and requests the latter are small tasks to help the people of hisui while the former is how you progress through arceus story you can use your arc phone in a very sheikah slateway to set waypoints map out the region and moreas wellas expected battling in pokmon legends arceus is turnbased like the traditional pokmon games however theres a twist in the form of different move styles if you use an agilestyle move it raises the users action speed which means their next move might happen sooner butthe move will be weaker strongstyle moves on the other hand cause your pokmon to sit out for a move and in return hit stronger the next time they attackalpha pokmon will be tough to battle but easily spotted thanks to their large size and glowing red eyes catching them will be tough but it will be worth ityou can customize your character with a variety of clothing items at the clothier in jubilife village as you progress through the journey of arceus youll unlock more and more items including hairstyles shirts pants and morenoble pokmon are special frenzied creatures that rampage across the hisui region theyre easy to spot too as they glow gold these are essentially boss battles depleting their health wont end the fight instead youll need to throw special balms at them made of their favorite food in between throwing balms youll need to dodge its attacks to surviveat some point during the fight the pokmon will reveal an opening and then you can attack now you have to actually defeat it in battle before you can finally catch it the narrator promises that these will be someof the toughest battles in the entire gameand thats where the video ends pokmon legends arceus will hit the switch on january while waiting for its release catch up on some of the recentlyreleased

an artist for its internal team clover studios that job meant a lot to her personally aside from being a fan capcoms games were something nakamura bonded over with her father which offered a personal connection to the workduring and since nakamuras had a hand in developing several cultfavorite video games including kami bayonetta and the evil within series working for platinum games and tango gameworks after capcom but for the majority of her career she was relatively unknown within and certainly outside the game industry that is until when her presentation for ghostwire tokyo thrust her into video game stardom thanks in no small part to her outgoing and offbeat personality nakamura has since become a social media favorite befriending prominent game developers such as sony santa monicas cory barlognakamura is more or less an overnight sensation and since leaving tango and ghostwire in september people have wondered what her newly founded studio is developing despite that much of her story remains unknown where she came from her career at capcom and platinum and her experiences at tango to remedy this we reached out to nakamura and talked to her for hours in one of her first big american interviews posttango about everything from her love of horror to her oncedaily nightmares while working on ghostwire to what she plans to do nextgrowing up nakamuras father kept one secret from her mother he was bonding with their daughter over a shared love of horror movies and video gamesnakamuras father raised her the same way he wouldve raised a boy and the two were both daredevils in their own ways where her father rode motorcycles nakamura climbed on the roof of her familys house and jumped off their staircases which to be fair is a dangerous activity for a little kid as evidenced by one of nakamuras childhood injuriesone day i fell from the stairs and lost the lower part of my face nakamura says laughing explaining she hit the ground face first the skin and the lower lip got dragged it was almost like i lost my lower lip my mom saw it and she passed out from the shock so no one could help me out at that timehorror media made the biggest impact on nakamura as a child nakamura and her father hid this from her mom who didnt approve and they spent a lot of time watching scary movies and playing horror and gothicinspired games togetherit cant be overstated how profound an influence horror had on nakamura its something she constantly brings up when talking about her early life growing up she says she watched horror movies every day such as american classics like return of the living dead she also loved staples of japans horror boom from the midtolate and such as pulse kairo in japan directed by kiyoshi kurosawaat the same time as she puts it japan was in a golden age of video game development and capcom was just one of many companies spearheading that charge nakamura spent a lot of time playing games in the resident evil and devil may cry series which coincidentally have been directed in the past by shinji mikami and hideki kamiya who nakamura would spend most of her career working alongsidenakamura went to art school in tokyo and later the amusement media academy to study game design however only a couple years into her education her life was turned on its head while out on his motorcycle her father was in an accident and passed away suddenly sending her life into total chaos she spent a lot of her early life acting reckless but nakamura says her fathers death changed her leaving her focused on protecting her familyafter his death i totally changed she saysbut one thing didnt change nakamuras dream of working at capcom if anything her fathers death reinforced her desire to join the company after her schooling he loved capcoms games and during his funeral nakamura made sure he was still able to play resident evilin his coffin i put a copy of the resident evil strategy book and a playstation controller she says so that he could play the game in another dimension but i forgot that japan is a cremation culture so his bones and the controller got stuck together i looked at it as he never gave up the game even when he was a bone i was impressednakamura had to apply twice but she joined capcom in coming on board its internal clover studio initially set up to develop viewtiful joe clover was a semiautonomous studio within capcoms osaka japan headquarters tasked with developing new intellectual properties in line with nakamuras influences mikami and kamiya worked as directors for the studio the former overseeing god hand and the latter helping make viewtiful joe and kami released in and respectivelynakamuras first project was kami she joined clover as a environment artist a job she says she was incompetent at despite her lack of experience and the fact that some people within the company werent treating her well nakamura applied herself and tried to learn as much as possible on the projecti was new i didnt know really how to work and was constantly told that i would be fired she says i was pushed around overloaded with tasks and challenges and so i went around to different sections to ask about how to work better and what i can help with helping with anything i could making animations or small stages or objectsat the time nakamura describes capcom as an oldschool developer full of behavior that wouldnt fly in a modern workplace for example it wasnt uncommon to see developers sleeping under their desks to save themselves a commute something presented to the public on television in both japan and the united states when she was a kid nakamura says that when she saw that footage it seemed like a dream job now that shes older not so much i felt like oh my god thats what i wanna do she recalls but then looking back like no that is totally wrongit also wasnt uncommon for capcom management to let their tempers get the best of them lashing out and yelling at employees or hitting desks and kicking trash cans they would just kind of hit everything around them nakamura says adding that it showed her the kind of company culture she doesnt want to create in the future for which shes thankfuloverall it wasnt effective she says people do get frustrated that happens but showing that physically or verbally that creates fear in the work environmentnow i know what not to do nakamura saysthe relationship between capcom and clover was an acrimonious one with constant clashes between management and kamiya over kamis direction according to nakamura her impression was that capcom saw clover as just the group of weirdos and a totally separate entity as an example she points to the wii port of kami developed by ready at dawn which didnt include the names of the original developers or the clover logo in the creditsin capcom issued a statement about the missing credits saying the removal was due to a prerendered cutscene containing the clover logo which the publisher did not have the legal right to use in a game the studio wasnt directly involved in we also didnt have the source to the credit movie itself so we couldnt just use it and remove the clover logo capcom saidim sure something happened politics nakamura says but its not a cool thing to do for the developers who actually spent hours and effort to create the gamedespite the issues nakamura isnt wholly negatively about her time with capcom in fact since kamis development wrapped shes been open about her desire to make sequels that deliver on the original vision of the first game as she puts it the game capcom released was probably onethird of what kamiya initially had in mind and now that nakamura has worked for other developers specifically ones partnered with publishers based in the states she admits to wondering whether or not she shouldve stayed at capcomwhat wouldve happened nakamura muses because out of all the companies i worked with capcom is a company that allowed artists to input their artistic sense in the game the mostwhen we point out we expected the opposite answer that capcom was the most restrictive nakamura adds maybe thats what japanese people who stayed in japan and didnt deal with other companies overseas they might say thatof course nakamura didnt stay when numerous people left capcom and clover to found their own studio nakamura went with them starting her journey at platinum gamesin retrospect nakamura says its probably for the best that her first project as director didnt get madeearly into her time at platinum nakamura submitted a proposal for a nintendo ds game that caught the eye of mikami who came over to platinum as a contract director and external board member the project as nakamura tells it was to be several small eerie games touching on taboo subjects the project was greenlit and despite her lack of experience nakamura got to lead her own team it didn go well and the game subject matter ended up being a point of contentioni even went to nintendo to give a presentation and they told me if platinum games released this through the ds not that it will be the end of platinum games but platinum games will have a really really bad reputation nakamura saysabout one year into development nakamuras project was canceled and she was moved to the team making the first bayonetta a stylish action game inline with director kamiyas earlier work on devil may cry she was a concept artist even if it was a partially selfappointed title i wanted to graduate from being an environmental artist so i took the liberty of calling myself a concept artist and started drawing designs nakamura says i think i acted strongly and felt that i should do what i wanted to do even if it was in an organizationat the time nakamura was playing a lot of games developed by american studios especially uncharted gears of war and dead space this influenced her approach to game design specifically when it came to bayonettas user interface based on the games female focus she also brought in influences from famous women throughout history fashioning bayonettas accessories after women such as cleopatra to accentuate the overthetop aspects nakamura suggested making buildings gigantic and the action outlandish all aspects that made bayonetta stand out when it was released in the same time nakamura began thinking about how to develop games that appealed to a global audience not just a japanese one her hope was to show players in other countries how cool asian cities and culture were though her specific vision wouldnt be heavily applied until later gamesfollowing bayonetta nakamura served as art director on platinums nowcanceled scalebound while microsoft signed on to publish it still never saw the light of day nakamura says her time with its troubled development left her with lasting lessons for future projectswhat i still think about is was i successful in creating what the director wanted to do she reflects the concept wasnt fixed it didnt have a strong vision what the publisher wanted what the director kamiyasan wanted and what the team wanted were all kind of not looking at the same direction so it didnt have the unity it was my job to create the unity and i dont think i was able to provide that so thats something i felt like i couldnt do back then what i learned is the director has to have a very clear strong vision from the beginningby the time scalebound was canceled nakamura had already moved on from platinum when mikami founded his own studio tango gameworks in nakamura was part of the group that joined him allowing her to move back to her home city tokyo it was not only the job shes held the longest thus far in game development but the one that thrust her into the spotlightjoining tango gave nakamura a chance to do something shed wanted to do her entire life make a survival horror game and it would be one directed by shinji mikami the director of the first resident evil no less but its complicatedthe evil within was tangos first official release and mikamis return to survival horror however the developer had previously experimented with an openworld sciencefiction survival game called noah as detailed in a polygon interview with mikami early in the companys history tango hit financial issues noah was canceled and tango was in trouble until later in when publisher bethesda purchased the companycompared to the image of a typical western game publisher bethesda is probably more like a typical japanese publisher mikami said at the time they dont force creative people to do stuff they give that creative freedom to developersnakamura tells the story a bit differently mikami really wanted to create new types of games not keep doing the same things hes done she says but people in the world wanted him to create expected him to create survival horrornakamura found herself on a project she had dreamed of making with the caveat that in her mind the director didnt want to make it rope in western publisher politics something nakamura up to that point wasnt familiar with and it became a complicated project the evil within released in was the last project mikami directed and the developer has since stepped into a producer role to allow younger developers to direct games nakamura was one of those developersafter some time on the evil within released in nakamura began leading development on what would become ghostwire tokyo her direction was to take a bunch of elements from her love of the occult supernatural and urban legends and combine them into a contemporary setting which in this case as the name implies is tokyoremember when we were talking about bayonetta that i wanted people from all over the world to think about how cool asian urban cities are she asks so i wanted to bring that back i was like finally i can make a video game that can express my vision that wayas of this writing ghostwire remains unreleased but nakamura filled us in on some initial ideas set in people throughout the world have started to disappear leaving those left behind to assume it might be a virus taking people out to combat this people begin wearing masks however in amid the crisis nakamura says shes glad that iteration of the story isnt being released however she still speaks proudly of the general setting atmosphere and supernatural directionnakamura had the chance to present ghostwire to the world for the first time at where she got on stage during bethesdas press conference to announce the game understandably the idea of getting on stage in front of thousands of people not to mention many more watching live was nervewracking as nakamura tells it the numerous rehearsals over three days didnt help nakamura isnt a native english speaker and she says she had trouble with her lines so she practiced them over and over while pacing around backstagehowever at the last second nakamura says the shows producer told her to forget her prerehearsed lines and to go out on stage and be herselfnakamuras presentation became one of the standout moments of that while debuting ghostwire her passion for the project endeared people to her and her use of humor to explain the games atmospheric world was a welcome change of pace compared to the numerous selfserious presentations usually filling overnight nakamura became a sensation a meme and in her own way a celebrityi was simply happy about all the responses because i was really passionate about presenting what i was passionate about nakamura says and also im a big fan of manga and anime so i love all those memes and that ended up leading to people focusing on game creators so i feel that was a successbut nakamuras time on ghostwire was about to end eventually the stress of developerpublisher politics and the publisher having control over the game affected her negatively nakamura began having nightmares about higherups within the company this went on for years she says starting with just talking in her sleep around once a week and then progressing to daily nightmaresthe nightmare i had was that when i came to work all the members of the development team had disappeared nakamura recalls then there was an altar in the middle of the room and when i looked at the picture it was of my boss which was a strange storyher health declined around this time as well and four years into development on ghostwire nakamura made the decision to leave both the project and tango getting to that point wasnt easy nakamura likens ghostwire to a child and herself as the mother four years is a long time to lead a project and walking away was a difficult calli was a creative director so this is literally my baby she says my fouryearold baby so to let that go ask any mother to let her baby go it was that gutrippingnakamura became a free agent but as she tells it she left without much of a plan and then something unexpected happened once news of her departure hit the internet she began getting offers from developers worldwide and she befriended some of the bigger names in film and game development including sony santa monicas cory barlog film director jj abrams and rainbow six siege creative director leroy athanassoff regaining her health nakamura even traveled around the world to visit studios learning from different creatorsbut there was one unexpected twist around this time nakamura became pregnant it made some studio visits difficulti had never wanted to have children myself nakamura says because i thought that my children would be a game in fact i became healthy and an alien came into my body i flew all over the world and visited many studios while being amazed and throwing up from the bad effects of morning sickness i feel like i have thrown up in every studio its a memorial for me dont worry i threw up without making a messin march nakamura announced she had designed a new set of skins for rainbow six siege the product of her new relationship with the developer more than usual the news was picked up by mainstream game press outlets cementing nakamuras stardom even when it came down to something as small as skins additionally nakamura conceptualized and directed her first music video for the japanese dance group dazaifu mahorobashu she also says shes consulted and done design work for other games but doesnt elaborate on which as they arent out at the time of this writingnakamura is at a new stage in life and shes taking advantage of it on top of her work consulting and designing as a freelancer she recently announced shes opened her own studio and while the company will initially be headquartered in tokyo nakamura says shes prioritizing diversity within her workforce and hopes to open other offices in countries such as the us and china all her current team members though working from home are scattered across the globe she tells usnakamura has also become a visible female japanese game developer while people such as mikami and kamiya are known by name and for their work its not as common for women to receive similar recognition nakamura is in a rare spot to inspire others to make similar impacts on the industry and its not an opportunity she plans to waste she says she plans to put other women developers in the spotlight and highlight individual creators when the time comesthere is a female creator who is like a big sister to me who takes care of me nakamura says she said to me i want you to sit on the throne someday because your success will encourage me and many other female developers at the time i didnt really understand what she meant by that but now i know what it meansit was purely a coincidence that i was known i became somewhat famous she says yes it was a coincidence but im going to make that into an opportunity and use it to work for methis article originally appeared in issue of game informerheader image kerri solaris ,en,540.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/04/shin-megami-tensei-v-review-in-progress,Shin Megami Tensei V – Review In Progress,the classic and punishing shin megami tensei franchise is back with a new mainline entry and its full of everything weve come to expect from the series challengingbattles intense demon negotiations and philosophical conundrums about the state of the world ive been playing shin megami tensei v already clocking close to but i havent reached the end to deliver my final verdict until then ill say shin megami tensei sticks close to its roots for better or worse this means common series complaints such as poor navigation and obtuse instructions remain but atlus has also enhanced certain aspects with more expansive areas more skill customization and stellar demon designs if youre an smt fan you should feel at home with the long hardfought journey that awaits if youre a newcomer some of the games more archaic and arduous ways might turn you offas a longtime fan ive enjoyed a good portion of my journey through smt v however id be remiss if i didnt admit ive also spent my fair share of time yelling at the screen due to infuriating bosses or searching for a needle in a haystack to find some wellhidden path sometimes it feels like the game does everything it can to prevent you from succeeding or progressing and thats always been part of the point things dont come easily in smt but overcoming the greatest obstacles does come with big rewards and satisfaction nothing beats having a boss wipe out your party with a single attack only to come back stronger with better skills to counter thati love the adrenaline rush of the doordie fights but ive been a bit disappointed in the story narrative has never been smts forte but i always looked forward to the interesting ways the series presents issues about the world that dont have clearcut answers i played smt v for hours before the story started offering meaningful choices about how i wanted to recreate the world just like in past entries you get to choose how you want to change the world with decisions representing the law and chaos ends of the spectrum the storysslow pacing hurts especially in making you care about this world youre supposed to save and recreate considering the big stakes i havent felt much for the characters or the worlds impending doom they all feel like background noise to get you out in the world and fighting some characters represent different philosophies on how you can reshape the world such as keeping the status quo or knocking down all the structures in place but it doesnt help that these characters are very onedimensional so far i havent gained much insight into their logic and what these paths mean for the world i hope that changes by the games finalethankfully the triedandtrue gameplay has entertained me enough to ignore the humdrum story beats my interest is primarily due to the demon recruitment and the fusion system which like past games remains the heart and soul of the experience in short you sway enemies to your side with dialogue options and then combine monsters together to create better ones to use in battle i continually try to upone my last creation and i love the freedom alongside increased customization on hand for both your demons and player character beyond the choice of deciding which skills to carry over when you fuse demons you can also infuse a demons essence to transfer their skills for the main character you can also gain a demons affinities using their essence for example if you find a demons essence that blocks multiple elements your main character can inherit those it seems like a small thing but it can make a big difference in difficult battles i used this to my advantage when i encountered bosses with deadly elemental attacks to ensure my main character stayed alive and blocked them for an extra turnthe turnbased combat is at its best in smt v and its reminiscent of iiis pressturn system it requires a lot of thought to optimize your turns which comes down to a mix of buffsdebuffs and exploiting elemental weaknesses watching your turn number increase by landing critical strikes or hitting an enemys weaknesses is a delight special magatsuhi skills which can be used once you fill a gauge by doing things like landing attacks only add to the fun as these can do everything from refilling your partys mp to makingtheir next attacks be criticals i experimented more than i ever have with finding complementary skills to increase damage and i loved coming up with new tactics based on my demons powersexploration is greatly expanded for this entry and i loved how i was compelled to scour every inch of every area i found great rewards in doing so as you can find statues that raise all your demons levels valuable items and special bossesquests hidden throughout the area and in hardtoreach places are creatures called miman collecting these little fellows and reaching certain milestones rewardyou with extremely useful items i liked stumbling upon these things and felt their rewards were worthwhilethe areas arent only bigger but theres a lot of verticality to the world this time around youll find yourself platforming to reach higher points and using height to your advantage to locate paths and items in the distance some of the platforming is punishing as missing a jump means going all the way around to the beginning of a long platforming sequence at times the world is frustrating to explore due to its sometimesconfusing layout design i didnt like constantly consulting the map just to find certain destinations having your head in a map kills the immersion and thrill of explorationmy time with shin megami tensei v has been full of highs and lows but thats what ive come to expect from the series i like a lot thats here even if it makes me curse sometimes for instance save points are pretty plentiful but they dont prevent the easy loss of progress from one battle gone terribly wrong which happens a lot in the world of smt i respect atlus for knowing what smt is and not trying to rewrite the formula and turn it into something its not i just hope there are some surprises left before i finish the game right now it lacks a certain something to make it truly memorable outside of its excellent demon designs,en,510.0,Positive

Master Duel Is A Great Exercise In Putting Yourself Out There,yugioh master duel reminded me that putting yourself out there is challenging whether you duel on the regular or are dusting off the deck for the first time in years pouring your heart and soul into constructing a deck and pitting it against a stranger online is surprisingly nervewracking what if my card synergy isnt any good is my opponent snickering at me because my cards arent up to the hottest meta what if i lose that fear can be surprisingly crippling and prevent you from enjoying the best aspect of the game testing your skills against fellow duelists even worse it keeps you from getting betterbattling this mindset is something ive continually coped with from to i was a competitive yugioh player i never strutted into the hallowed halls of a world championship tourney or anything but i was a regular at my local comictoy stores i remember how nervous i was testing my deck which i only played against a small friend circle i assumed strangers would obliterate me even though i was proud of what i created i couldnt afford all the toptier cards and having that exposed felt embarrassing the anxiety almost made me want to avoid public play in the early days but my friends support and my passion for the game got me over the edgeas i competed in more and more tournaments that fear of embarrassment and losing subsided for one i got spanked quite a bit so i quickly learned to enjoy swallowing spoonfuls of defeat more importantly i realized it didnt matter if i lost no one called me out for sucking i wasnt sent to the shadow realm a loved one didnt perish and my opponents were rarely jerks id get a gg and move on but i learned from those defeats and returned better prepared it also made me more willing to experiment with my strategies sure id get a raised eyebrow now and again for making an unorthodox play but i didnt mind as much because id given myself permission to failafter retiring from tournaments during my college years i got my yugioh kicks playing video games id been away from actively playing for a long time so i was content with dueling ai opponents my confidence to challenge strangers vanished and that nagging anxiety returned from tag force to duel links to legacy of the duelist i avoided online matches like the lion kings elephant graveyard i stayed in my comfort zone of dismantling jaden yukis predictable strategies time and again playing these games got me to speed on the current format but i hit a skill ceiling and wasnt getting betterwith yugioh master duel i challenged myself to step up to human players again and regain my confidence im glad i did not only is it a blast encountering so many types of duelists decks and strategies but its also a mental exercise putting my creations out in the world though necessary having people judge something i made can be exhausting after a while ive been a writer for over a decade now and believe it or not i still get jitters pitching feature ideas or hitting that publish button for the same reasons i was afraid to show off my dark magician deck all those years ago its scary but sticking your neck out accepting the possibility of failure and learning that messing up isnt the end of the world makes life a lot easier and more rewarding but you have to keep putting in the reps and dont allow yourself to slip back into your comfort zone for too long keep creating whether it be a duel deck or a wild potentially worldchanging idea and throw it out there to see if it sticks youll score a win sooner or later and nothing is more satisfying,en,330.0,Positive

Mindset Behind Developing With Early Access",in valve launched early access on steam while other titles had experimented with paid access to a work in progress such as minecraft in steams program brought the concept to the mainstream avenues such as indiegogo or kickstarter allowed for crowdfunded titles but there was no regulation as these options werent required to provide backers with playable versions of the games they supported steams budding program allowed developers to selfpublish games but required a playable product and allowed users to refund their purchases further down the line since then early access has exploded andtitles like the long dark dont starve and playerunknowns battlegrounds have gained massive popularity that they may not have achieved without this new method of development and deliveryearly access seemed like a dream come true for developers but there are many difficulties associated with development using the program according to gamesindustrybiz only twentyfive percent of early access titles make it to a full release why is it so difficult to launch a game out of early access i picked the brains of crytek motion twin system era and red hook studios about their experience with early access to help get a better picture of why the program is a worthy gamble for developers despite the number of games that didnt complete their development and why developers and players are more likely than ever to jump into itfeedback can lead to better iteration and fixes on a budding game in the case of dead cells entire systems have been reworked based on community engagement the skill system was originally a simple three stat system like skyrim revolving around health stamina and magic and sbastien bnard the games lead designerhad no plans to modify this system throughout development until a conversation on the steam forums changed his mind it was a debate between players bnard said they were talking about this build system and how it was actually kind of boring and not very profound they were right on the very core problem of this system bnard later went to the team with the idea to shut himself in for about four weeks and rework his entire skill system decisions like this are scary for teams but they are why early access can be such a boon in the first place he says having the ability to get player feedback that is thoughtful alongside having direct communication is why the system is so appealing players can feel like they have a real impact on development if teams are willing to take suggestions and implement thembuilding games as a group is the most appealing aspect of early access for many fans as well being part of the development process it really gives that sense of community said angela de castro product manager for hunt showdown it feels like you are working together with the team to accomplish something that you can make some sort of influence on the final productone of the main reasons studios enjoy the early access development model is the benefit of playtesting and creating alongside their communities chris auty the design director on cryteks hunt showdown a pve based free for all where five teams of two duke it out as they hunt monsters for bounties saidthis is the primary reason it entered the early access program what attracted us to early access in the beginning was that we knew that this game would be developed closely with the community we wanted to make sure that we could iterate quickly on it with the community alongside us this is especially helpful for games that require a lot of balancing and tweaking such as multiplayer titles and systemsbased roguelikes an example would be community feedback changing the speed at which crytek delivered content moving them into a model of adding content from as close to every two weeks to larger updates within fourdead cells developer motion twin felt its game was a tough sell on paper a roguelike infused with dark souls sensibilities and a progression system that requires players to fail getting it into players hands and allowing them to see why the game clicks was important producer steve filby said early access is a good way for us to sort of put something out there that is maybe not one hundred percent instead of taking three years and build a game and fail you can only take a year and then failfor many small development teams another major draw of early access is the financial safety net it provides many teams dip into their savings to make the games they love and early access is a huge leap of faith with system eras astroneer a wistful space exploration coop basebuilding game the situation started out dire the earliest version of astroneer was built alongside our day jobs said sound designer riley gravatt later we were able to work for about a year on astroneer fulltime with our savings but we knew we needed additional financesred hook studios had an incredibly successful kickstarter with darkest dungeon a lovecraftian turnbased roguelike featuring permadeath the studio raised with only a goal before going into early access but most of that money went directly into development and the team still had to survive early access is a friendly cashflow model to a struggling developer said tyler sigman studio copresident and design director for darkest dungeon being able to make sales while the game is still in development directly funds that continued development and can allow you to invest more in making a better game while still keeping food on your table at homefor many developers today early access is not the question mark it was in given the long string of success stories like darkest dungeons and dead cells players are more willing to jump into these titles titles built alongside a community can be appealing because they allow players to feel like they helped the development and have a sense of ownership over the final product early access has been around long enough now that its no longer a foreign idea gravatt said most players understand what it means they know what they are getting into and the risks of investing in an early access gamesigman echoes this sentiment i think we are safely out of the is early access dead phase where there was great debate about whether early access should be a thing there have been enough great games that have come out of early access that i think consumers understand that early access can be great there are of course failures but that true of game development as a whole tooplayers may be more willing to support early access titles but they also are more scrutinizing of the program sbastien bnardknows players are still hesitant and that developers have to be conscious of that i think it is quite a mixed feeling for the player because most of the timeplayers just don want to go into early access and have a fear that they may have a bad experience he said theyll say i think it is a cool game but it is still in early access most players will wait until it is released and not beforeearly access is designed for small developers to make games they couldnt otherwise but these teams take a big chance on the service the risks are the same any aaa developer faces but early access also poses a few unique challenges developers have to fund and produce their own titles work indefinitely depending on how long the game remains in development and ultimately serve as the arbiters of their own success or failure daily moderation of their forums weekly patches or developer blogs all are important to making sure players know what is happening with the studio and the game essentially forcing studios to serve as their own public relations marketing and community management teams as well there are no publishers or safety nets the program provides a way to fund and distribute a game but it is up to developers to market and push the game to playersclearly laying out a roadmap for development consistently telling players where progress is and being clear with delays and issues that arise is an important element to keeping communities happy most fans understand the challenges developers face but they definitely appreciate timely updates and expectation setting through communication sigman said going completely dark during early access is a big mistake if you behind just say it and people will know you haven abandoned the gamein early access there is a fine line to walk between creating the game you want and communicating with your fans learning along the way can cause struggles with the community and the developer for many a focus on community contact is incredibly important you really need someone dedicated to it gravatt said thats where that fulltime position comes in to play they really need to distill down all the feedback and concerns of our players and bring it to the development teamthe development roadmap is one of the most clearcut ways teams can communicate to players what to expect from their early access title updating the roadmap and making sure it is reasonable is important for developers despite only recently coming out of early access unknown worlds entertainments well thoughtout development and success with subnautica has inspired many we were introduced to the concept of the developer timeline by subnautica gravatt said they pretty much set the standard for what works for an early access title sigman shares the sentiment they made consistent updates and just kept making the game better and better and bigger and bigger as a fan that should be a good thing keep making this awesome game betterfor these studios updating the roadmap and having flexibility is key to progressing at motion twin dead cells ended up being more a community project than the team originally expected we thought we should have a precise roadmap and we should take leadonmaking the game the way we want bnard said quickly it was obvious we could adjust and modify the game in a profound way based on player feedback still following the roadmapearly access has its benefits but the style of development has created a whole new set of challenges even for veteran developers at crytek a studio known for big budget aaa games like crysis ryse and the original far cry the move to early access was not challenging in the ways they expected issues arose however when it came to workload the hardest part for us has been that you don really stop auty said in aaa development you work quite hard towards the end to get it done and then its over and you start figuring out the next thing that you going to work on with early access that is a lot more sustained over a longer time so that is a big difference from our perspective we have to be very careful to pace ourselvesin early access even singleplayer games require live team fixes games have their current builds that need to be maintained but also new builds that are being built for later in the roadmap running two builds is an issue that has cropped up for system era and many other developers in early access normally in game development things can break internally you can develop alongside lots of bugs or systems can be built from the ground up without worrying about supporting existing users gravatt said thats certainly not the case with early access you kind of have to build two games simultaneouslyone problem developers face is making sure their game is successful in its first iteration while simultaneously making sure improves enough product from the last build to ensure new players will want to jump in console ports and postgame addons can help stymie the possible dip in sales with darkest dungeon the dip in sales for the release was surprising the first hours of early access we sold three times what we sold in the first hours of sigman said early access was incredibly successful for us so we just grateful to have a good launch whenever it comeseach of the studios we spoke with were realistic about the possibility that wont see the same success as the early access release filby is aware of the challenges dead cells must overcome everyone tells you you don get two launches but i am going to try and buck that trend he said if we don do percent of what we did at early access that fine the main thing that we do differently to some developers is that is not really the end of the game we have already talked about another sort of dlc or major update that we will put out for free postreleaseearly access titles take a long time to develop and many are in the earliest stages of infancy when they launch on the platform it is up to the consumer whether they are going to make an informed purchase with an early access title sigman said players should not be preoccupied with when a game leaves early access the best way to protect yourself as a consumer is just make sure that at the moment you buy the game you feel that it worth the money i not saying don ever take a chance just be aware with what you are doing games are very hard to make and even harder to predict how long they will take this is doubly true in a scenario like early access where one of the main points is to collect feedback and act on it you don really know what you have until you let people play it darkest dungeon was in early access for just less than one full year which i think is pretty fast comparatively but i chuckledbarfed a little when i saw a few reviews talking about how dd finally exited a long early accessstill the reality of the situation is not lost on any of these developers their games have molded into something the community has built with them and they realize these games are becoming something much more than what they originally envisioned especially for gravatt astroneer is a system era game as much as it is a game owned by the community who plays it he said we share authorship of the game between us and our playersearly access has its roots based in delivery systems that have been around for years betas and closed alphas are ways that players have affected change on major titles through feedback these systems were primarily reserved for multiplayer games and only offered what amounted to a demo of the final game unlike early access with the advent of steams program major publishers have taken notice with microsoft adding a game preview feature that has many popular early access games that are exclusive to its console such as battlegrounds and astroneer despite this many aaa developers have yet to take the plunge with games like battlefield v and call of duty black ops still using typical testing models such as closed alphas or the always derided preorder beta hopefully more bigbudget studios will see the viability of early access as many could greatly benefit from it as many are moving to gamesasservice models that require longevity and online content delivery that is impossible to test without continued public feedbackearly access is a powerful tool one both players and developers need to research before jumping in risktaking is healthy for the industry and many games that wouldnt normally get made have been developed by inspired teams thanks to early access none of the titles mentioned would exist today without the program and while there is no perfect formula there are enough successes to show it is a great way for budding developers to create the games of their dreams the simplest advice for developers and players comes from dead cells filby just dont be an asshole laughs if developers continue to communicate and learn from peers and players remain empathetic and patient early access could continue to provide many more great titles in the futurefor more on early access check out

enthusiasm surrounding pokmon snaps release unlike other popular pokmon titles up to that point it offered the chance to catch creatures not with a pok ball but with a camera the game featured rushing rivers sunny beaches and dark caverns all stuffed with familiar specimens the most skilled players snapped to our young minds unbelievably realistic shots of these roving pokmon in their natural habitats while the evermoving vehicle pushed onward but it wasnt enough to capture wild pictures of our favorite creatures we needed to share these works of art with the worldshort of parading friends past the home console to admire our digital albums there didnt seem to be a good way to do so enter the pokmon snap station it tells you something about the games popularity that its developer went to the trouble of getting these bulky printing machines set up across north america fans of the game could now find the nearest pokmon snap station and print out physical copies of their photos to show off in real life though those magnificent machines and most of the rental stores housing them are long gone the impulse to share awesome ingame photos is not gran turismo introduced its limited photo mode in and though it didnt have all the bells and whistles were used to today it helped pave the path for other games to follow when new pokmon snap launched over years later video game photography was everywheretechnology played a significant role in that transformation wireless internet connections and the soaring popularity of social media meant developers no longer needed to find a way to bring physical printing methods to the gaming masses and of course graphics had come a long way since the betterlooking games meant more pictureworthy subjects mix all this in with the alreadypresent urge to share epic moments with fellow gamers and youve got a recipe for todays photo modefilled landscapenow its almost more surprising when a game doesnt include a picturetaking feature for some games developers insert this mode directly into the games world red dead redemption for example gives players a camera right out of the object sits in your inventory alongside your indispensable arsenal of weapons but lets you shoot the scenery rather than meddlesome lawmen theres no shortage of breathtaking vistas to commit to film either one of the most praised aspects of red dead redemption is its expansive and detailed environment which contains hazardous mountain passes alligatorinfestedswamps and windswept plains you can even turn the camera on protagonist arthur morgan if you are so inclinedsimilarly the legend of zelda breath of the wild leaned into diegetic photography when it was released in as link explores the stunning openworld he can pull out his trusty phonelike sheikah slate to pose for a quick selfie or memorialize his journey theres even an optional series of side quests challenging players to capture and relive special moments in the hopes of jogging links lost memoryanimal crossing new horizons also jumped on the ingame smartphone idea by giving the player a nook phone happily it comes bundled with the island getaway package and doesnt put you in any more debt to local moneybags tom nook nintendos hit slightly blends the ingame and nondiegetic picture modes while players can and did judging from the copious amounts of pictures invading social media feeds during the pandemic take fun selfies with the nook device the game also prompts players to take photos with the switchs capture button during more significant celebratory momentsbesides giving fans a way to share their ingame adventures or misadventures in some cases photo modes also allow them to experience their virtual sandboxes in slightly different ways than other players one virtual photographer might set up shots that establishdifferent relationships between characters or highlight their heros unique view of the world occasionally these pictures spark internetwide fan theories or launch viral memes that in turn influence the games legacymany recent games packing a photo mode take the nondiegetic approach perhaps finding gamers dont necessarily need the snapshots to have an ingame explanation god of war and ghost of tsushima are great examples after god of war launched santa monic studios reboot of the wellknown series introduced a photo mode feature it offered several options for the discerning artist including filters borders and an assortment of technical adjustments while some used these tools to enhance the dramatic tone of kratos journey with his son others delighted in slapping a smile on the greek heros usually stoic face with perhaps one of the most lauded photo modes ever ghost of tsushima invited players to craft the perfect shot with a dizzying amount of tools and the benefit of the games cinematic style and particle effectsit would have been hard for anyone with an online presence to avoid seeing images taken from these games which speaks to another aspect of the modern photo mode players showcasing their ingame pictures with these tools simultaneously share the game with everyone in their social media circles thats a big win for game makers wanting to get their creations in front of as many potential players as possible of course this is not intentional for most wouldbe virtual photographers like the kids huddled around pokmon snap stations in the late most gamers today just want to share cool pictures of their games with their friends,en,486.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2018/06/15/so-what-exactly-is-going-on-in-babylons-fall,So What Exactly Is Going On In Babylon's Fall?,all we know about platinum games new title babylons fall is a timeline the quick trailer shows a rapid chronology of events sprinkled with proper nouns like elder gods ephesian book and soul plague when watching the trailer in real time reading any of the text that flashes onscreen is almost impossible however a framebyframe look at this history reveals snippets of text that form a year backstory and hints at where the game may eventually take usin the first half of this article well try and sort out all the names places and events that whiz by during the trailer after that we can take all the info thrown at us and make some educated guesses about the characters and gameplay mechanics of babylons fallthe power of the oversoulthe early history of babylons fall is shaped by a mysterious energy source with the power to create weapons or even see the futurediscovered in ce the oversoul is a catalyst for humanitys advancement although the specific properties of the oversoul are mysterious different communities eventually figure out how to harness its potential and capture its energy for their own gainthe first group to do this is the helos empire one of the many kingdoms that make up the larger province of abenland the helos use the oversoul to build powerful weaponry but restrict the use of such arms to only the elite members of societyshortly after the creation of those weapons a group of seers from all across abenland come together and use the oversouls energy in another way predicting the future using crystallized fragments of the power source the seers compile their prophecies into a tome called the ephesian book unfortunately the book became known for its most dire prediction the seers foresaw an allconsuming darkness that threatened to wipe out humanityhumanitys first falldespite desperate attempts to avoid the darkness infighting and divine wrath doomed abenlandin an effort to avert this disaster the helos empire sent a person named waland to investigate a distant land this quest would bring him to a place the book predicted would be the location of mankinds revivalalthough what waland found is unknown abenland fell regardless fed up over the elites control of the oversoul the proletariat rose up against the ruling class in a fullblown war this conflict disgusted the previously unmentioned elder gods who wreaked unstoppable havoc on the humans of the worlda failed redemptionhumanity squanders its second chance but finally find the tools to challenge the godsjust before extinction a new god gaia rescued humanity by creating an entirely new world even this new land wasnt free from conflict however after an initial period of peace the ephesian book of prophecies was found and caused widespread panicseizing the opportunity fearmongering religious factions used the book and a mysterious plague to grow their ranks this new land fell into a conflict similar to what doomed abenland and just like abenland their war drew divine wrathgaia humanitys previous savior turned against them this time though humans wouldnt rely on another god to save them gaia faced a new threat of resistance a group of powerful and mysterious humans called the nomads led by the nomads humans finally turned to face their godso what does any of this mean here my interpretationcharactersgiven their appearance late in the timeline and apparent power im confident well probably be playing as one of the mysterious nomads the trailer shows a very brief fight between two beings and the winner of that fight is positioned alongside the nomad moniker it slices a giant suit of armor in half for petes sakeits very likely that one of the games antagonists will be divine the way the timeline describes it the nomads are largely defined by their opposition to gaia if were playing as one of them then our enemy is predeterminedwe also know of a number of human factions though the techsavvy helos the religious scholars of gaia the futuretelling seers any of these could be potential allies or enemies in babylons fallalso intriguing is the mention of waland although only in the timeline once and years before humanitys uprising heshe is the only human character mentioned by name could waland be the founder of the nomads or maybe even who we play asgameplaythere are hints at gameplay systems within the timeline it seems obvious that the oversoul will be the source of our weapons in the battle from the trailer the nomad has a sort of energy tendril that he uses to rip away the attacking foes weapon this tendril looks exactly like the ones that we see coming from the oversoul early in the trailer babylons fall has made it clear that the gods are major players in this fight regular swords or guns would be poorly suited to killing the divineim curious if there will be any use for the crystallized oversoul fragments mentioned in the timeline although theyre used in the fiction to tell the future crystal fragments also seem like a distinctly gamey collectable maybe theyll work as something that plays with the nature of time like a dynamic checkpoint system they might also just be shiny collectibles we really dont know much at this pointregardless this weird historyfilled timeline has me excited for babylons fall platinum may have an inconsistent track record but their best games are high water marks for the entire action genrethe backstory theyve laid out has serious potential this lore presents opportunities for hopping between both worlds and eras the studio has even explored timetraveling and clashes with divine beings in before in bayonetta as weird and new as babylons fall seems platinum is on their home turf,en,445.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/06/10/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodhunt-preview-battle-royale-meets-vampires-no-seriously,"Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodhunt Preview - Battle Royale Meets Vampires (No, Seriously)",when i think of the battle royale genre a few things come to mind pubg fortnite apex legends boredom it not a bad genre but not one i ever really felt super connected to what i do feel connected to however is vampire the masquerade so when sharkmob approached me with a new game that is literally battle royale with vampires i was too intrigued to say no surprisingly enough it works here my vampire the masquerade bloodhunt previewfor those that may not be the biggest of tabletop fans vampire the masquerade is a stunningly expansive rpg experience that has evolved so much through the years numerous adaptations have come and gone to expand upon this world including video game takes that breathe fresh life or unlife into the characters we know and those we can create i tanked years into this universe and used the very rules of the masquerade to build so many fancreations of my own so imagine my surprise when the latest game to be announced under this umbrella was a pvp battle royale adventure now take that surprise and imagine how that tripled when i found myself really enjoying my time with bloodhuntrightit turns out thatthis is actually the perfect pairing what are vampires if not incredibly cunning creatures with the means and desire to kill what is battle royale if not very much the same unlike other shooter genres battle royale consists of a blend of tactical waiting and rushing for the gold hurry up and wait if you will that strategy when placed up against a macabre backdrop of vampiric glory and you got yourself an innovative game that fills a niche that we didn even know needed fillingmy time with bloodhunt was a little rough around the edges which was expected given that the build i enjoyed was in the early alpha stage taking to the clans that i intimately familiar with through previous tabletop experience i was excited to explore how those skills would play out when going up against other players against the devs themselves evenbloodhunt is set in prague and where we started our bloodthirsty journey was in the heart of elysium those familiar with this property will recognize that as a neutral hotspot for clans to meet in the realm of battle royale however it anything but neutral in my first round i chose a muse mostly because they looked pretty and that was always a class i chose when rolling my own character i got smoked i think i was one of the first people to die because i kept just running in like a maniac the only upside was that a dev that worked on the game died immediately after me so i felt a little bit better the second time however i wizened up i chose based on skill not aesthetic and went vandal she still looked cute don worry and the tides of battle changed i think in my second match i ended up landing in the top spot which isn too shabby when you remember that i died first the previous roundfor centuries vampires have lived and thrived among humans maintaining the masquerade now a treacherous betrayal has stirred a war amongst the vampire sects exposing them to the secret society known as the entity with a holy mission to annihilate all vampires they take the hunt to the streets of pragueplayers will need to use their supernatural powers weapons and wit to survive the night and restore the masqueradethe skills definitely matter here there is one class that can heal themselves and allies there is another that just harambesmashes foes into the ground of the six classes shown there is a playstyle for everyone which helps when pairing with different gamers before diving into a match for the killjust like any battle royale game there are resources to be found all over the map including live victims to drain their blood to boost powers and regain health the standard weapons can also be found including sniper rifles smgs a bow and a sick pair of daggers that made mele so much funthe good thing about sharkmob making a game within the battle royale scope is that theycouldhave fun with it battle royale is pretty cut and dry you know what needs to be there to make it enjoyable and players know largely what to expect this was very evident when playing with the team because we were joking the entire time about how we couldn believe there is actually a battle royale game about vampires it was obvious this team had a lot of love for the lore and for the community that surrounds vampire the masquerade this isn a cheap shot it not a disrespectful parody it a standalone experience that newcomers to the staple can enjoy and veterans can relish it just a genuinely enjoyable online experience to dive into with friends and an experience i was pleasantly surprised to learn that i wanted to play more ofdid i mention you could also scale the tallest of buildings like you in assassin creed because you totally can and itprague provides a beautiful backdrop for this game each shop that was enterable had its own personality it had its own evidence of life there was a surprising amount of area to explore for being a contained battle royale map due to the verticality of the aforementioned assassin creedesque scaling this made playing a more tactical game easier to do especially if you landed yourself a sweet sniperthe character customization was also fun especially making my goth babe have silver hair like mine and winged eyeliner that could kill a man there are cosmetic options that players can choose from as well since this is a freetoplay game there are added cosmetic options such as outfits glasses makeup etc to purchase with real money but that not out of the norm for a game that is completely free none of the purchasable items are paytowin either they are purely cosmetic so you don have to worry about any bait and switch when it comes to what is free and what is freeat the end of the day vampire the masquerade looked rough but that was because of the alpha build despite the shorn edges of the gameplay experience i can see a real treasure buried beneath early development woes will this be earning game of the year anytime soon no and it not meant to it meant to purely be a fun competitive pvp experience set within a world that has a very dedicated community and you know what sharkmob nailed itfor those interested in checking out this weird dreammadeareality there is a closed beta kicking

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2020/06/09/bungie-details-the-coming-era-for-destiny-2,Bungie Details The Coming Era For Destiny 2,bungie has remained very quiet on the subject of whats coming next in destiny even with the impending arrival of a season that is scheduled to begin today in a live stream to kick off that new season the developer has at long last pulled back the curtain on the current content entitled the season of arrivals and also shared a much longer term plan for this autumns expansion which will be called destiny beyond light and if that wasnt enough we also got a tease for the longer term trajectory of the storyline and adventure with names for the expansions releasing in the witch queen and lightfallafter a preshow that highlighted bungie challenges in working remotely in recent months and the shifts that the team has made to its teamwork and charitable giving the timer ended and the stream got started but thatstream began on a somber note with bungie taking time to acknowledge the death of george floyd with a nearly minute period of silence in line with the period of time that floyd had a knee pressed into his neck leading to his deathafter the extended silent pause the stream shifted to its expected focus on the new aspects coming to destiny we got a trailer andan announcement of release date for destiny beyond light which will arrive on september in addition to revealing europa the new destination the big reveal was the return of the stranger a character not seen since the original core game of the first destinywe got a good bit ofdetail about the season that begins today season of arrivals the games eleventh season focuses on the longhinted arrival of the pyramid ships in our solar system and will see guardians fighting in the literal shadow of these ships with new public events on the moon of io players will also begin to discover messages of darkness on io over the course of the season which presumably begins to offer some clues into the nature of this force that has been teased since the launch of the franchise in players will also have the opportunity to dive into a new dungeon launching later today the prophecy dungeon launching today at pacific will offer up the new daito foundry armor as well as reprised versions of the armor sets from trials of the nine and the broader focus of the dungeon is on the fiction elements surrounding the mysterious group called the nine in a separate note to media bungie also detailed a new approach to rewards in season of arrivals players will be able to focus new engrams helping to choose and finetune the nature of their rewardson the subject of rewards we also learned the name and nature of one of this seasons new exotics which instantly unlocks for season pass owners witherhoard is an exotic grenade launcherwhile season of arrivals is clearly meant to be a transition season into the next major arc for destiny this falls destiny beyond light is a fullfledged expansion that aims to dramatically change the game today we learned that players will face a new enemy threat above and below jupiters frozen moon of europa europa will be an entirely new destination which includes glaciers a lost braytech facility and other mysteries as well as a new sixperson raid far beneath the surface called the deep stone cryptin keeping with the expansions name beyond light also introduces a new power source that is rooted in darkness stasis is a new elemental power in the same vein as the arc solar and void power sources that players have utilized thoughout the life of the franchise while we know that stasis will be used differently by warlocks titans and hunters bungie is holding off on additional details until later in the summerfinally beyond light also offersa big new development for one of the central enemies we already know the fallen as a new leader rises in their midst after numerous setbacks that guardians have inflicted on the fallen over the course of the destiny storyline the remnants of those scavengers will now unite under a kell named eramis as the fiction has long suggested eramis once wielded the light as guardians do before she was abandoned by the traveler we can only hope that well finally learn more about that previous dynamic and the earlier history of the traveler and what really led the fallen to acquire their namewe got a glimpse of some of the gameplay on europa including a look at the new stasis power source subsequently an extended video helped to chart the toplevel story points from the entire life cycle of the destiny franchise bungie luke smith and mark noseworthyspoke about some important changes planned for the game including a move away from some of the fomo and changes to the quest login todays stream bungie alsooffered next to no detail about later plans for destiny but simply by offering names and time frames we can draw some important conclusions first unlike destiny launch in after a threeyear lifecycle for the first game bungie has no immediate plans to move on to destiny instead destiny will remain the central platform for some time likely at least until the autumn season of bungie also committed to the idea that each of the expansions will feature a brandnew destination the names of the intervening expansions are also important the witch queen coming in isa reference to savathn the sister of oryx her manipulations and deceptions have been a big part of the lore in the last few years the name the witch queen echoes the taken king name when we fought and defeated her brother lightfall the expansion suggests dark times ahead for the guardians and the traveler at least if we take things at face value given that this fall will see our guardians already flirting with calling on powers of darkness its not hard to imagine that the storyline is going to be taking some bleak turns over the next few years of gameplaybeyond specific expansions we also garnered some intriguing details about broader aspects of the game including nextgen plans for destiny the nextgen version of the game will run in and at fps and if you have any existing destiny content including this falls beyond light expansion youll be able to take that with you for free to nextgen the game will feature intergenerational crossplay within console families so playstation players will be able to play with playstation players and xbox series x players will be able to play with xbox one playersand what about crossplay outside of console families bungie is remaining cagey but they are exploring the concept if it does come it will be after this yearand last but certainly not least bungie has some dramatic plans for how it handles its older destinations moving forward as destinations from earlier installments are reintroduced and existing destinations in destiny are shuffled out of circulation and put into what theyre calling the destiny content vault mercury io titan and mars are all scheduled to enter the vault in year while the new europa destination an enhanced version of the cosmodrome and some of its related strikes from destiny as well as the vault of glass will all come back into circulation in year a lot of content to digest but its clear that bungie has some big plans for how to shepherd the destiny franchise over the coming years in the meantime were eager to see how this current season plays and like all the rest of the guardians out there we will be checking that out over the coming days,en,508.0,Positive

since the oldsmobile company started the largescale manufacturing of cars in one of the dumbest things you can do with your free time is walk anywhere while you could easily argue cars have been abysmal for the environment and forced us all to deal with elon musk you can deny that getting behind the wheel to go anywhere is far easier and less strenuous than using your legs why on earth would you walk anywhere it dumb your little legs don have the power of a hemi and they definitely can hit milesperhour on the highway you can accessorize your legs either like you can a car try throwing truck nuts on anything other than an and you going to jailvideo games know this fact of life too since mario first punched yoshi in the back of his head to get going developers everywhere have experimented with new ways to allow players to traverse worlds in more convenient ways grand theft auto popularized the idea of driving around an open world using any vehicle you can get your hands on to quickly get from point a to b and people sure do love those games grand theft auto v is one of the most successful entertainment properties of all time it was such a hit in fact that it inspired developer rockstar to add horses to red dead redemption of this is to say cars rock lowriders motorcycles monster trucks ford pintos you name it bud cars are cool and one of the finest achievements in human engineering they made modern life bearable if i was born before i don know what i do with myself walk halfamile to the store to pick up a copy of usa today i would rather diefor my money one of the best games of the last years is death stranding a game that revolves around walking hideo kojima very expensive vanity project about the loss of human connection and the destruction of the environment like most games is a very political tale it tells a story about our current civilization and the dehumanization of automation how our search for convenience through companies like amazon has left deep scars on the earth and our personal lives it also kind of a breakup song about kojima former employer konami but that neither here nor theredeath stranding has cars and they suck for the vast majority of your playtime you are just walking from a to b from b to c and so on and so forth it takes a lot of time to get across the game truncated version of the united states which actually looks more like iceland as you guide protagonist sam porter bridges played by the walking dead norman reedus on his journey to deliver packages and reconnect the united states it an incredibly methodical and arduous journey full of hammy writing and metaphors not so much on the nose but rather hitting your nose with a brick over and over and it fantasticwhat i like most about death stranding is the walking i like the story too sure and i think the starstudded cast featuring mads mikkelsen margaret qualley lea seydoux and more do a great job but the appeal of death stranding and the reason i think about it far more than most really expensive triplea games always comes down to the time i spent walking from here to there to everywhere in fact even when i had unlocked all the various vehicles the game provides i rarely ever used them no matter the distance terrain or dangers along my footpath i was going to walkthe simplest way death stranding walking mechanics work are in the objectives and microobjectives that present themselves on any given trek because bridges is a porter you set on each journey carrying any number of packages you may need to deliver from one all the way to dozens depending on what you can fit on your person along the way you might find more packages discarded by other porters which you can pick up and deliver if you so choose delivering these packages feels good it an easy way to make the player feel accomplished even if the delivery is small because at the very least they still completed a number of tasks on their docketthis is exacerbated by the skill level of death stranding it a bit reductive to say you just walking from here to there in actuality you managing stamina balance and weirdly enough a baby with its own needs and emotions you doing all this on top of challenging terrain which at times has you crossing deep chasms rushing bodies of water and climbing snowcapped mountains occasionally you have to deal with antagonistic npcs either in the form of mules which try to steal your packages or bts ghosts of sorts that try to steal your lifethe delivery components of death stranding combined with the satisfaction of completing a tough journey creates a constant feeling of progression and satisfaction it rare to play death stranding and not be doing something that rewarding you in some way more often than not you stacking objectives on top of each other creating multiple avenues to complete tasks all at once that feels good it like a constant dripfeed of dopamine for my dumb little brain thank you mr kojima for curing my depression if only temporarilybut my favorite part of walking in death stranding is that it slow and often quiet video games especially triplea video games rarely give the player a second to think we are constantly bombarded with stimuli such as new things to shoot new explosions to run from or any number of other things the developer has inserted out of fear that we may get bored with their game even if only for a second while a lot is certainly going on in death stranding especially narratively it not afraid to be quiet to leave the player alone for upwards of an hour to just do their thing to just walk and complete their taskit these quiet moments that i often return to when thinking about death stranding the moments where i saw a big journey coming planned accordingly and then just walked my merry ass there in fact i got so into them i used to plan my afternoons around them knowing i have to take off with bridges on a walk that might take me an hour became exciting and i started to think about how i wanted to tackle my trek even when i wasn actively playing the game the quietness of that world the time to think and reflect combined with my dripfeed of dopamine was my reward i rarely ever took vehicles out with me in death stranding because they robbed me of those moments i didn want to get to my destination quicker i wanted to enjoy each footstep even when they got increasingly difficultsince wrapping the game in more so than almost any other game last generation death stranding is constantly on my mind and yet i never thinking about the things that ostensibly make it notable the celebrities bizarre stories or cultofpersonality around hideo kojima i just thinking about that walking in real life i don want to walk anywhere i drive around my house to save myself the hassle of walking between rooms if i could but in death stranding walking became the sole appeal of the experience because in a world with cars and

but everyone was really attached to the metal bending concept after we landed on that we just had to decide where rell came fromthe black rose who run noxus clandestine operations are interested in some horrible things to further the empires expansion and power explains narrative lead jared carnival knights rosen demon calling void magic resurrecting and controlling dead gods a little of this a little of that and one of the things this group of crappy aristocrats have discovered is sigil magic which has the ability to rip the magic out of living things and then forcibly put it into someone elsewith each foe taken down she grows stronger rell is the ultimate weapon something that the devs had a lot of fun withthe magic from the other kids is placed into rell with the sigil magic which empowers her own latent powers explains riot earp but the process is incredibly painful for both rell and the other students i focused a lot on adding the sigils to her armsespecially the one that holds her lanceto make sure its clear when playing her i wanted the pain that she underwent to be clear to players so they understood her pasti wanted to make rell the tankiest tank the world has ever seen i had this idea of a heavily armored character who sunders the ground she walks on making the earth beneath her collapse from her might says game designer stash riot stashu chelluck unfortunately thats hard to display in league and i still needed to make sure she thematically felt like she was manipulating metal i was looking for neat ways to map her ferromantic powers into her gameplay to really make her feel powerful and hard hitting without feeling like a magewith such a twisted backstory the reason behind her mount is actually a little more lightheartedthe first thing i thought of when i heard rell was a teenager and had a mount was a coinoperated horse ridelike the ones outside of grocery stores recalls davehelsby ive seen teenagers ride them a lot and its so interesting because you see a person on the cusp of being an adult but theres still a bit of kid in them i just feel like that made sense for rell she has a lot of adult responsibilities on her shoulders but shes still a kid and she deserves a little funrell will be joining the league of legends roster as the newest champion with patch ,en,483.0,Positive

games debuted its augmented realityfueled kpop group kda to the world back in league of legends fans were curious to say the least since the group debut song popstars the musical squad has been fairly quiet outside of a few staggering track releases but now that their full ep is out the world is theirs for the taking but how does a notsononfictional pop sensation take over the world beyond just the league of legends community we spoke with riot games to find outspeaking with riot music lead toa dunn and creative director of lol marketing patrick morales we learned a lot about the motivations behind taking on the music world in this fashion and where the next step should leadriot music group creates musicdriven experiences across numerous spaces in the riotverse including the games themselves entertainment mediumsoutside of working titles and in the esports scene when talking about the road leading up to kda success dunn tells us over the past few years we introduced various musicians from our music universe to our players this includes everything from pop kpop hip hop and more our teams have experimented with music and have explored different ways to bring music to life our music collectives and the individual artists as well as our league of legends champions that have been reimagined as modernday musicians and performers our hope is to one day have a thriving music universe that fans can interact and engage in unique ways and for us music is key all of this is in service of creating lasting memories and pop culture moments that resonate with players and fans alikethis creative approach to marketing saw a unique success with kda a success that has experienced a massive boom resulting in numerous media accounts to further the illusion of reality as well as a new ep that is available nowthe recently added seraphine sung her way into the game and into the pop group even having her own social media presence in startling detailmorales adds in many ways kdarepresents the natural progression of where we saw music headed as a creative medium within the company for much of league existence we cultivated this almost distinct musical identity in the ways that we supported the game from all the musical themes for each champion to all the cool worldanthems that we would put out for our players to energize each competitive event year over year but then we thought what else could music do in terms of really satisfying our players and possibly stand on its own as a creative experienceso back in the teams behind the riot music group and lead marketing came together thinking about the ways in which we could do this as a waybring the music experience to life outside of the game which inevitably became the founding pitch behind kda before all the skins all the music videos andall of the amazing things that we saw come out that year we really just had one simple goalcreate a true pop culture moment that would invite the outside world into what league was all aboutfollowing the debut of popstars as a single the group went quiet no new songs no appearancesnothing in that changed and a big reason for that reappearance according to riot games was because so many fans kept asking for more music the popstars song also was a huge hit in the vr game beat saber furthering interest for new contentwhile the stars of kda are rendered versions of real ingame champions the movements and inspiration behind the group is very real talent that being said the focus is on the characters themselves and making them feel integrated into our daily livesas real musicians we wanted players to be able to interact with them in the same way that they do with the kind of talent that you see in real life through social media something that we discovered especially recently through engagement events like spirit blossom festival is that our players are always really excited by the ways that we let them interact with our champions morales tells usso given the reality based nature of both the music universe and kda this is how we decided to do that this year in this massive multi month music launch campaign covering a breadth of different channels and tacticsseeing songs like popstars hit number one on music charts is exciting and was a huge surprise and a welcome one to fans everywhere the league of legends community is massive and it is showing no signs of slowing down now that riot games is earning that in its name with numerous titles many of which are spinoffs from league itself new eyes on the riot microcosm means more growth more interest and more reasons to keep pushing for better contentmorales adds that while success was expected the incredible magnetitude of it has been a wild ride kda moved from being an innovative concept into a space where this group became an unexpected spokesperson for league of legends as a whole we heard countless stories about music fans who got into league because of kda as well as those of league players who have discovered an entirely new genre of music because of it says dunni think the common thread that we saw was that you know there this unique connection that the music of league can fosterand that what we trying to do more of todaythe inspiration behind the music is very much fueled by the champions themselves and the events surrounding them kpop is a huge genre of music with an incredibly loyal fanbase but the blend of musical stylings is beyond just that niche it meant to be a celebration of these heroes a way to humanize them in an effort to connect the community even moreleague is much more than just the game it esports it online play it special events it an entire ecosystem built on community and the relationship between riot games and players kda is another bridge between the devs and the fans making the tightknit community even moreso while celebrating what brought everyone together in the first placedunn adds to that saying it really about creating meaningful content that delivers player value in new and exciting ways outside of the core game experience with the new ep and more content planned in the years to come the league of legends community is getting a highly desired breath of fresh airwith the new ep the future is brighter than ever with more music more collaborations and a continuously growing social media presence to lend to the realism kda is just getting started regarding what the group means to the league familywhile cartoonfacing groups isn exactly the newest concept think gorillaz having it be completely fictionalized is an innovative step taking that creative marketing concept to the next level using social media is smart if not unnerving at times when dealing with reallife concepts like depresson and anxiety and completely fleshed out speaking with the two riot games team members i wanted to know how they have handled making this fictitious group more human with reallife experiences and unique personas thus far how did the team evolve this concept beyond just the pop experienceone of the things that we really wanted to do this year was find ways for our players to connect with our champions because that level of interaction was always something that we found is pretty successful based off of experience that we provided responds moralesthis year we wanted to try something a little bit differently by actually giving them a voice through social media and that serves two purposes the level of interactionpreviously mentioned but also we wanted to tell a story league is very much an ip rich in storytelling in a variety of different mediums and we felt that this year would be a really interesting opportunity to explore what that would look like if players could actually have a hand in that storytellingultimately we looked at social media as an interesting platform for that we wanted to see where this could potentially lead the newest champion was one that we thought was really interesting we wanted to know how we could tell this sort of origin of a rising star who really got to discover herself and find a place amongst her idols so in terms of how we did thatwe followed a similar thought process to kda that philosophy was that we never really wanted to stray too far from the core truths of who these champions are a lot of the elements that people love about evelyn in terms of her being this kind of over the top diva are really just derived from her base characteristics as a champion within league she a demon that thrives off of attention and we wanted to create a lot of those same creative parallels with their kda personnas in much of the same way when we first heard that serophene was this musician who is really all about empathy at her core we wanted to create a story based off of that and really create a personality their core personalities created these personas and each social media profile is an extension off of thatit going to be interesting to see how kda continues to evolve and its influence felt within the league of legends community in the meantime the new ep absolutely slaps and you can listen to it for yourself in the

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/15/what-is-valheim-and-why-is-everyone-playing-it,What Is Valheim And Why Is Everyone Playing It?,over the weekend viking survival game valheim crested to a concurrent player peak of over players on steam while steam and other game storefronts are inundated with survival titles to choose from ranging from minecraft and its many assorted mods to ark to terraria to rust the new early access title from iron gate ab is barging its way onto the scene from a core list of features and mechanics valheim may not appear different at all from many other survival titles so what separates valheim from any of the other survival titles out there should you give it a try here are a few key takeaways that help explain valheims rise through the ranksyou can explore the world of valheim by yourself or with friends on dedicated servers or just by joining your friends world while the singleplayer experience is fundamentally the same game it plays much differently alone the game is more of a zen garden of sorts allowing you to take each day at your own pace enjoying every little piece of cooked grub and being the sole owner of every exploration every triumph and every discovery pacing as a solo player is much slower and becomes a sort of survival meditation as you plan each day and overprepare for every step outside your door after all theres no one to help you out should you get killed and need to perform a dreaded corpse run to get your gearmultiplayer is more traditional survival as players work together to craft multiple bases and take on the challenges of building gearing exploring and bossslaying together some players shy away from this style of play as not logging into the game for even a single day can have profound effects on what tier the server is at weve all started terraria worlds left for a day and come back to our friends zipping around in the sky with laser guns as we hold up our little baby wooden pickaxe but after around a week of diving into valheim the coop multiplayer is the best way to play meeting upwith your friends and bonding over a raft ride in a storm or just heading out to mine some copper together is a blastin fact you can resummon big bossesand they have multiple spawn locations per world so if you did want to play independently but still have a support group on a server that an option as wellif your crew is anything like mine players will naturally fill the archetypal buckets of builder explorer fighter and more making for a fun time whenever you log in if you choose to go the multiplayer route i highly recommend forking out the cash for a dedicated server so you and your friends can come and go as you please instead of having to wait for a friend to set up the world every time you want to play while i think the multiplayeris vastly superior and teamwork makes the dream work the solo game is an enjoyable albeit incredibly different activity in which youre sure to enjoyevery discovery yourselfof additional note the barebones pvp is entirely opt in and pretty much just for fun making the multiplayer aspect of valheim completely coop this almost eliminatesthe griefer vibe that can permeate some other survival games yes theoretically someone could come into your game and smash your house down if you open your world up to the public so try to play with people you knowvalheims structure is immediately discernible and understandable even for players far removed from the survival genre essentially each biome is a tier and ruled by a boss farm the zone for resources make new gear and recipes kill the boss rinse and repeat with tools to tackle the next zone via the boss drops the boss battles create servergathering events for you and your friends and if youre playing with a particularly inquisitive or adventurous group there are creative ways to sequence break the natural order of progression the key here really is that the game is understandable from the get go with a helpful crow giving players tutorial steps you dont need to worry about making fifty other items to craft a single item or complex multifaceted crafting schools its just get up and go and start making progress in your worldconquering the meadow is a breeze the black forest offers a significant bump up in exploration and challenges and things get considerably more intense in the swamp plains and mountains and valheim has optional secrets to discover as well that exist outside the biome hierarchy that can greatly enhance your options and progress like the merchant and a certain sea creature i wont spoil theres something to be said that you arent tasked with trying to cobble together thirty different types of resources just to get things going wood and stone is enough survival titlesare somewhat inherently intimidating by genre and valheim is surprisingly welcoming for a game where vikings battle werewolves in the snowyes valheim has some fairly hardcore consequences for death in that you need to run back to your body to recover your gear and items but you can prepare for it quite well outside of that though valheim rewards you for interacting with survival mechanics rather than punishing you for failing to do so eating food makes you much harder to kill providing hit point regeneration stamina and other bonuses but you wont die from not eating youre incentivized to find shelter and warmth from the cold and wet conditions but these things wont kill or damage you either from a gameplay standpoint this makes dealing with the world a lot easier you know that if youre going to be doing any difficult task like forging ahead into a new biome or taking on a boss youre going to want to be fully rested with hearty meals in your belly but you are not constantly nagged to death by hunger thirst or weather meters this design shift is highly significant for alleviating excess player frustration in a hostile worldmost survival games have meaningful discoveries and valheim puts an exclamation mark on them with sparse musical notes and wellutilized effects valheims world is surprisingly beautiful at times with impressive lighting and weather adding accents to the action rainstorms lightning blizzard whiteouts the first time redacted comes at you while you climb up the frozen slopes of the mountains your first journey on the sea where you run into the great redacted and summoning your first boss are just a few examples of momentous moments that youll have by yourself or with your viking crew while much of the fare in valheim is in fact featured in other survival games too valheim nails the discovery aspect filling players with equal parts trepidation and exhilaration as they wander into new areas for the first time finding some of the optional discoveries lends much to the standard biome boss biome recipe that might otherwise render the journeyrote and hearing the horn the first time you set sail on the sea is something you simply cant find anywhere elseyes there also the factor that is shining the spotlight on gaming experiencesboth solitary and social but it would be dismissive and wrong to attribute valheim success to that aspect aloneim happy that valheim is seeing a ton of early access success and i hope it means the team can eventually push out an amazing final product the realities of the situation are that because it is early access and only about half the content is there worldwise theres going to be an inevitable falloff as players hit the end of the current content offerings many will likely wait until the full version is available rather than tackling every patch on the roadmap while this is perfectly normal and expected expect plenty of cries from the peanut gallery that valheim is a twoweek game or lol dead game as the playerbase trickles out after the initial surge valheim is looking greatas an approachable intriguing and flavorful world you should probably take a look,en,602.0,Positive

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/02/14/how-to-defeat-the-bonemass-and-get-the-wishbone-in-valheim,How To Defeat The Bonemass And Get The Wishbone In Valheim,viking survival game valheim is full of dangerous encounters from errant skeletons and mosquitos to falling trees however the boss encounters like the bonemass are definitely much more difficultand deadly than other standard biome inhabitants the bonemass is the third world boss in valheim aftereikthyrnir and the elder so how do you beat itfirst you need to know where the boss is the bonemass can be found in swamp biomes so be on the lookout for runestones in swamp areas and in the sunken crypts your world will contain multiple spawn locations for each boss so if you are exploring multiple swamps or have multiple teams combing areas you may find more than one spawn point for bonemass if you have the option to tackle the bonemass in different locations pick the one that involves the least sailing and the least going through rough biomes like plainsthis next part is important for any boss except maybeeikthyrnirbut make sure that you construct a portal and a rough dwelling somewhere safe near the boss it entirely possible that you might die and you will want a quick way to get back to your body to recover your loot andor continue the fight trust me you do not want to be building a boat every time you want to get back after a mishap only to get slaughtered by some random blobs or leeches on the way back to your bodyyou going to need bones withered bones specifically you will need ten withered bones each time you want to summon up a bonemass these can be found in abundance in the sunken crypts dotted around the swamps so you should be able to collect plenty then you need to go to the point on the map where you identified the bonemass location look for a giant glowing green skull it hard to miss clear absolutely everything else around it to ensure that you have the least possible chances of getting attacked by some other enemies during the boss encounter bonemass spawns his own additional companion enemies so you really don want even a single other potential foe coming into the fighteverything was easy until now you going to want to take the best possible food you have into this battle as the bonemass can dish out incredible damage over time with poison and packs an incredibly powerful punch the bonemassalso summons poisonous blobs and annoying skeletons regularly during the fight and you will want to deal with them as soon as you can before you begin this fight you will absolutely want to stock up on consumables specifically antipoison mead and healing potions without poison resistance you are going to be playing a risky and doomed game here as his giant tidal wave of green goo is inevitably going to hit you at some point bring the best gear you have hopefully upgraded iron and a good blunt weaponutilizing one of the areaofeffect blunt weapons can be instrumental for controlling the tide of summoned enemies along the way don expect to be able to take out bonemass with ranged weaponry like the elder as it will shrug off ranged damage like it nothing so you are going to have to get in and get dirty at great risk to your own person for this reason i suggest that you amp your food potential with some lox meat from the plains biome the plains are not safe and filled with mosquitos goblins and the big lumbering loxes you can easily keep loxes at bay as they are very slow and you can cook their chunks for some high quality tier food also suggested are sausages or jam toget that hit point pool as high as possible if you are lucky a sunken crypt can be nearby the summoning location that you can pull the bonemass to if you and your team battle near the crypt you can duck into the safety of the dungeon if things get too hot to handle outside inside you can heal up and prepare to continue the fightthe bonemass drops a trophy and another important item that can change your interactions in all zones the wishbone the bonemass trophy unlocks a new special magical effect that you can activate at the ringed stones where you turn all the boss trophies in and gives you resistance that can help you in combat as an activated ability the other curious drop from bonemass is the wishbone which will let you discover silver ore as well as becoming a sort of treasure compasswith the wishbone active it takes up your belt slot you will hear chimes and see visual cues as you walk along through areas that function as a hotcold meter that can lead you to buried treasure sunken deposits of iron and more when you get to the apex of the magical pulsing and beeping bust out your pickaxe and start digging you can find all kinds of useful stuff underneath the earthif you exploring with a team only one of you needs to have the wishbone active and all other players can see it pulsing on that person if you handle the division of belt slots thisway your other team members can still have their mighty mighty belts equipped for maximum ore yields,en,388.0,Positive
gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/11/24/classic-wine-and-video-game-pairings,Classic Wine And Video Game Pairings,you probably seen a million lists online about pairing wine with food or wine with music hell even wine with movies but where are the wine pairings for video games to address this absence we talked with master sommelier morgan harris about what types of wines go best with which gamesbefore we start we should note that wine and game pairing isn an exact science pairing wine with food often results in chemical interactions that enhance or alter flavors this doesn happen with game pairings obviously fundamentally wine is a grocery which means it doesn really have a lot of structural overlaps with gaming which is a leisure activity harris says at their base they very different things but there is certainly some overlap and both of them are designed to give pleasure i would argue that much like games a lot of the joy of wine is in the discovery like exploring a world as you would in an openworld game the joy of wine is tasting the novel and trying new things with that caveat you can think about types of wine like genres of games to some degreetaking that into account here are several wines you might want to pair with a game for a solid night inclassic german riesling is really acidic but it also sweet i think it funny that we have a sort of bias against sweet wines as americans we don drink that and yet we love soda which is the exact same thing it really tart and kind of sweet sitting around drinking a glass of german riesling is a lot like that it like playing something that kind of mindless and fun something like stardew valley or in some ways like valheim where you just sitting around and relaxing and taking things at your own pacein northern italy a famous grape there is called nebbiolo and that goes into two wines one called barbaresco and one called barolo when they young the wines are really really tannic so that the drying astringent sensation you get and they high in acid they great in the context of red meat but they not really a lot of fun to sit around and just drink when they young because they so grippy and astringent but that kind of like something like dark souls right it really challenging but if you spend some time with it and you have the patience and like something fullflavored and intense it might be your thingchampagne in some ways is like storybased rpgs in that you can get lost in it as its own little world again with the caveat that wine is always kind of for sharing for me there something very relaxing about drinking champagne and also playing storybased singleplayer rpgs because you just do everything at your own pace okay there a bunch of quest icons everywhere but if people don want to do that side quest you don have to do that side quest no one hurrying you along no one rushing you you just do the whole game at your own pace no one else is depending on you to do anything else and so champagne for me is very relaxingsauvignon blanc is kind of like fighting games in that they are very particular in their flavor there a certain greenness that not going to be everybody thing some people love it they really love it but for a lot of people it too strange there a certain sweaty up up down down a b a quality or whatever we gonna call it that is appreciated by a particular set of people who find that sort of thing pleasurable i think sauvignon blanc is the same way you either love it or you hate it also there a lot of different expressions of it around the world there a lot of different like subgenres of fighting gameschardonnay doesn have a lot of flavor itself and very much takes on the personality of the place where it comes from so you have something like chablis which is from the northern portion of france and it very lean and low alcohol it grown in a cold place and they don really use any oak on it on the flip side of the spectrum you have something like california chardonnay which is very rich and oaky and buttery they both the same grape but they very much informed by the place they grown fps in some degree is the same way you have a looter shooter like destiny which is sort of bullet spongy the fps mechanics are there but it plays a little bit more like an rpg and then you have stuff like the whole cod series which has its own particular set of flavors which are some people thing and not others then you have games like valorant or counterstrike they all kind of interrelated to each other there a lot of different ways to look down a gunsight and shoot people even in one genre there a lot of different expressionsthere ubiquity to mmos as a genre that i think go sort of hand in hand with something like cabernet sauvignon because it an experience that almost everybody has had there are very few people at this point who haven played one or don know what one is so there a lot of parallels there i mean the number of gamers who have not played mmos and certainly thinking of world of warcraft as a principal part of the genre it dependable it reliable everybody can find something inside of it to lovepinot noir is kind of like a roguelike or roguelite pinot noir is really really hard to grow but when you do it well it is one of the most magical grapes out there it very much has a highest highs lowest low quality certainly you could think about something like spelunky or hades in the same way when you start on it you know there gonna be a lot of disappointment but as you pick up more and more of what you like when you do something like beat hades for the first time you feel really accomplished pinot noir is like that as well you kind of got to slog through a lot of what could be mediocre wines to find one that really exceptional because it really hard to grow and it not for everybody it takes a deft hand and fair amount of skill to producepairing wine with games is all about drawing structural similarities between genres and types of grapes but there are no onetoones ultimately if you pair a bottle of wine with a game you likely to have a good nightto some degree games are a competition says harris even if it you versus yourself wine was never really intended to be a competitive thing if you like drinking easygoing white wines it doesn matter how many points a napa valley cabernet gets it probably never really going to be your bag but they both leisure activities you meant to have fun with them i would argue that like with a lot of things sharing with friends is one of the best ways to both game and drink wine go over to their house buy a bottle of wine and talk about it engage with it just have funbut of course please remember to drink

Bungie's Recent Pivot To A More Raw, Honest Form Of Storytelling",much like the first destiny destiny fell into a rut at launch the game launched under the activision helm as its publisher and while the team did include a more indepth story as requested from fans of the first game the endgame content and most immediate subsequent expansions did little to connect with players between the controversies of paywalls convoluted narratives and a grind that didn seem to be going anywhere destiny future started out in a precarious place then bungie separated from activision and became its own studio once more and while unraveling influence on that scale takes time we first saw the teams gain their footing with the forsaken dlc which was preseparation but marked a significant turning point in how the storytelling evolved and then again with shadowkeep where bungie truly found its rhythm was with the season of the chosen and splicer weaving meaningful tales that go beyond what we seen before within the game bungie explored themes only briefly touched on in the past and that decision continues to pay offduring the recent witch queen showcase bungie confirmed that it has seen the positive reactions from the community regarding the last two seasons and that the team wants to lean into that eschewing the reliance on grimoires and making the story more available for all to enjoy season of the lost has only just begun but it has already shown promise for continuing on the powerful momentum gained with the previous two seasonsbeyond this point contains spoilers for an important scene in season of the lost if you do not wish to be spoileddo not read past this pointif you been following my coverage through the last two seasons then you know i been pretty adamant that i thought osiris was who savathun was masquerading as a fact we learned during season of the splicer following chosen heavily teasing her corruption throughout the city i have also been convinced that the takeover happened following osiris ghost death sagira so imagine my elation and trepidation when both theories turned out to be true what i loved about this confirmation however wasn that i was right buthowbungie told this particular story just as with chosen and splicer it clear that the various teams that work towards fulfilling the creative vision of destiny have found their cohesive stride and that flow radiates throughout the narrative it not just about the story anymore it about the tone and how it told and that has seen a drastic pivot in the past year when exploring the complexities of the human experience even if we aren all humanwhen savathun detailed all of the ways she helped the guardian and the city against various threats with the most recent aid against the vex and lakshmi influence she explained the moment when the osiris we know became something else season of the chosen explored zavala grief and the impact it had on his life his perception and his relationship with those around him season of the splicer explored saint selfactualization and growth as his own man while crow struggled to find his place in this new world season of the lost kicked off exploring the impact of osiris grief after losing his closest friend his ghost sagira sagira perished when she and osiris began investigating the cryptoliths at the hand of a high celebrant of xivu arath she died protecting osiris a fact that he couldn come to terms within his grief and guilt savathun found her in taking over the form of osiris the osiris that we grown closer to over the past seasons the osiris that guided crow into learning who he is following the death of uldren sov is not osiris at all the lover of is lost and we will need to find him through aiding mara sov in her quest to purge the dreaming city of its curse and recover the tech witches that have also been lost throughout the game events but it wasn just that she was able to secure him through his grief it was the way she explained his grief that truly made this arc hit home savathun is known as the queen of lies which means she has the power to shape our perceptions and shake up all that we know to be true with her garnering of the light and creation of hive guardians her silver tongue has already begun its influence in season of the lost tampering with the tapestry of truth that we thought up until this point the recounting of her takeover to the guardian balanced empathy while flirting with a condescending tone almost the way you talk to a child it was that blade edge that made me feel for osiris and hurt for saint but it also made me worried that another theory i had could possibly see fruition are we the bad guys are there bad guys at all or are we all just floating in a sea of greywe are only at the start of this season and our quest to help mara sov with mara comments about uldren death and his transformation into crow and with the trepidation felt at the thought of conspiring with savathun this season is already shaping up to be a wild ride i can wait to see what next especially with all of the new features on the horizon with witch queen arrival next year if you missed

Is A Perfect Picture Of Duality, Pain, And New Beginnings",destiny season of the splicer has finally reached its end and not only did it bring chills and tears but it also brings hope for the franchise future the latest season did more than bring new game aspects into the shooter such as the expunge and override events transmog and muchneeded stasis tweaks in pvp it also continued what season of the chosen beautifully laid out a story that transformed the online adventure weaknesses into strengths and provided guardians with a tale that has as many twists as it does heartbreakswarning massive spoilers lay ahead for the splicer epilogue so i recommend not reading past this point if you have not played it yetwe previously talked about the quiet strength of the crow in this season and the feelsheavy turning point in the current season narrative concerning a certain still the epilogue of splicer truly did the story justice while expertly teasing a tumultuous time ahead with the upcoming witch queen expansion but like in my earlier deep dive about saint awakening i can help but be in awe of where the game is now despite its rough launch and vaulting of half of its content on paper that should be a pretty massive nail in destiny coffin but instead it has been a rebirth that makes me more excited than i have ever been about what nextif you followed literally any of my news coverage about the game this season you know i been mad suspicious about osiris and the epilogue vindicated my suspicions but first let go back a little for some background informationfor those who are still here and haven worked their way through the latest season yet splicer centers around the fallen andhacking the vex networkwhen humans offered shelter to house light fallen within the last city the leader of future war cult couldn let go of prejudices and her own suspicions she thinks that bringing the fallen into the fold will result in disaster a calamitypurposefully perpetuated by the displaced fallen it been exciting hearing her back and forth the lover of osiris initially echoed her suspicion still osiris compassion and desire to do good in the world as well as saint own interaction within the last city offered a chance for him to open up his worldview and put him on the path of letting go of his ignorance after speaking with mithrax throughout the season and learning how guardians are monsters to them like the fallen are to the guardians the characters reached an understanding in a moment of honesty and vulnerability unfortunately fwc leader wasn swayed and she paid the ultimate priceearlier in the season minthrax spoke to osiris lover and told him the eliksni tale of the saint a guardian that killed swaths of fallen even children with no mercy and of the fear that the name brought to his people we saw a different side to our own people we saw the hidden nature that everyone has within them the potential to be the villain despite intentions the potential to bewrong honestly the way this entire interaction went down was incredibly raw and made my heart clench much in the same way that season of the chosen did seeing saint murder with abandon seeing how the fallen perceived that act of violence only further humanized this species within the destiny universe while saint himself did not respond immediately the scene sets up the story future in a breathtaking manner an evolution that when paired with the fact that many important npcs in the last city are hearing savathun song made me feel that we as guardians were screwed beyond compare after the epilogue i now convinced i was completely rightthe ending of splicer saw one more adventure into the override event this time following a broadcast where lakshmi declared that the future war cult herded the fallen in the city to take them out once and for all and plot twist osiris helped her the end of the broadcast cut off abruptly with saint cry out leading our guardians out into battle once more like the parallel witnessed at the end of season of the chosen another parallel can be seen here in the talk seen between minthrax and saint earlier in the season about saint past with the fallen he can be seen standing over an eliksni and readying the final kill shot in the epilogue the same positioning can be seen with and another fallen but instead of a weapon he offers his hand in help instead when minthrax tried to get saint to see it was a losing battle to get him to safety the titan proudly declared that you are my peopleand stood firmwhen i say this moment made me cry and gave me chills i not kidding as humans we all had those moments of gutpunching growth where it feels like our entire world has been ripped out from beneath our feet only to realize later that where we landed is a much better place than where we were before that growth that life seeing saint own growth his acceptance of change at becoming his higher self is inspiring it relatable the ongoing narrative of splicer much like chosen even spaced out the story in a way that fit the liveservice formula providing meaning to the grind and the new events and don even talk to me about the later expunge missions where savathun is directly talking tous not our guardian but us the player if you interested in my tinfoil hat conspiracy theories aboutthatone i dove into that hereas a bonus we got to see holiday zavala and ikora all kick all of the ass alongside one another once more and it was epic ikora smirk when she let out her inner fighter was nothing short of perfect and seeing holiday sight down her weapon with the skill that we all know she has beautifulthe epilogue wasn just a moment of growth and a heartwarming display of rediscovering compassion we know this is going nowhere good with savathun walking freely in the city that foreboding sense of what next increased tenfold whenosiris can be seen overlooking the battle even as saint fear is heard over not being able to find his partner when i saw the calm look on osiris face a character known for his kindness and benevolence my heart sank deep into my belly and i justknewi know my theory has to becorrect hehasto be who savathun is hiding within while that not confirmed at this time i can shake the feeling that this is what the next season will center on savathun disguise will be revealed but what happens then can we find the real osiris is he dead or am i wrong and it someone else entirely that remains to be seen but we know that bungie is hosting a

gameinformer,2022/05/04,https://www.gameinformer.com/2019/11/06/inside-the-bizarre-development-of-shenmue-iii,Inside The Bizarre Development Of Shenmue III,shenmue isnt like other openworld games in addition to the traditional fastpaced fistfights the series gamifies some of the most prosaic moments from everyday life while most games offer players a sense of freedom shenmues freedoms extend to opening silverware drawers feeding stray cats and collecting toys from capsule vending machinesshenmue is often derided for its plodding narrative goofy characters and unusual attention to detail and yet fans have been eagerly awaiting the next entry for almost two decades shenmue is weird but that weirdness has earned it a legion of fans who ponied up more than six million dollars through kickstarter to revive the brand in order to explore what makes this franchise tick we traveled to ys nets offices in japan for an exclusive demo and a peek into the mind of creator yu suzukishenmue was supposed to save sega by the sega was in decline the companys saturn console had failed to gain traction and the publisher had lost much of the mindshare it had gained during the genesis era sega was banking big on its new dreamcast console but it needed premium bigbudget software to drive players to the new hardware sega turned to yu suzuki and shenmuetoday suzuki is widely regarded as a legend of japanese game design as one of segas star developers for over years suzuki produced a string of arcade hits like hangon space harrier and after burner one of suzukis biggest successes virtua fighter helped pioneer graphics and briefly gave fightinggame giants like street fighter and mortal kombat a run for their moneyin after more than a quartercentury with sega suzuki left the company to form his own studio ys net this studios offices are a simple collection of rooms tucked into a nondescript building in the middle of tokyos urban jungle we arrived at ys nets front doors around noon two hours late for our appointment the day before a typhoon had torn through tokyo completely destroying the citys publictransportation timetables fortunately suzuki was three hours late when the designer finally arrived at his nearly empty office he offered a weak smile and a bow he was eager to get back on schedule but he was also excited to share his inspirations for the original shenmueback in the sega wanted suzuki to take virtua fighter and spin it off into something new something like an rpg suzuki had been waiting for an opportunity like this as a young programmer he was mesmerized by apple ii rpgs like ultima and wizardry he wanted to take some of the concepts featured in those early releases and expand them into a modern game he rushed home and began jotting down ideas for his own epic rpg narrative about a boy on a quest to avenge his fathers deathbefore long a small team of sega employees was helping suzuki prototype this new rpg for the saturn the games early working title was the legend of akira named after one of virtua fighters mainstays but as development progressed the title evolved into an identity of its own suzuki renamed the game shenmue a japanese word meaning spirit treeoriginally pitched as an rpg shenmue was wildly experimental and combined fighting elements with adventure gamelike information gathering and a finely detailed town that players could explore at their own pace in many ways shenmue was ahead of its time as it experimented with several openworld fundamentals almost two years before grand theft auto iii would codify and popularize the genreshenmue was really one of the first openworld games says suzuki after shenmue there were a lot of other openworld games its become one of the biggest genres and i very happy to know that i created the original which sort of triggered that kind of trend of open worldin the term open world hadnt been coined so suzuki described shenmue as a free game an acronym meaning full reactive eyes entertainment this strange word jumble was suzukis way of letting players know that they were free to interact with anything they saw in shenmues environments and its world would react to them players could open any drawer in ryos house and examine its contents chitchat with every person in town and waste days playing old sega games in the arcade shenmues attention to detail was painstaking suzuki had determined the blood type for all of shenmues nearly npcs and the games weather system was based on realworld data from japan in the suzuki had created a game unlike anything else on the marketall those small details came with a cost shenmues development had stretched on for six years and its budget had ballooned to almost million dollars making it the most expensive game sega ever produced when it released in december of shenmue received generally positive critical reviews but it was not the blockbuster sega hoped for after the release of shenmue ii in the publisher was hesitant to commit to another entry suzuki tried to keep the series alive by prototyping a shenmue mmo but that never saw the light of day series star ryo made a few cameos in games like sonic sega allstars racing but as time wore on fans began to fear that they may never see a resolution to shenmue iis cliffhanger endingbut that wasnt the end of the story as luck would have it suzuki would get another opportunity to continue his epic tale and that chance came more than a decade later from halfway around the worldryan payton has covered a lot of ground in the games industry over the years he worked his way up the ladder at kojima productions to become an assistant producer on metal gear solid guns of the patriots then moved to industries to be a creative director on halo before finally founding his own studio camouflaj where he is currently working on iron man vr before any of that payton was a shenmue fani imported the japanese version and played it as a college student and i actually learned a lot of japanese from it says payton who is now project advisor on shenmue iii i was always really bothered by the fact that yu suzuki had this incredible saga of games he wanted to tell and how that was seemingly ending with shenmue ii i always felt in the back of my mind that if i ever had the opportunity to help yu suzuki i would because in a lot of ways he was a god of the japanese games industryby payton gained the means and the knowledge to help when he raised dollars on kickstarter to fund development of an episodic stealth series called rpublique paytons experience on kickstarter was so positive that he immediately thought that the service could be used to fund another shenmue game thanks to the help of sonys mark cerny payton was able to connect with suzuki and pitch him the idea of using kickstarter to fund the development of shenmue iiias we sit around the tiny austere conference table at ys nets offices suzuki recounts those early discussions and the emotional journey he took while deciding to bring shenmue to kickstarter of course i was thinking really deeply he says i knew it could be hard but the most important thing for me is that i make this game for the fans for those who are willing to support usbefore the kickstarter suzuki says he briefly considered scaling back the scope of the project to create a simpler telltalestyle adventure game that would easily allow fans to experience the end of the story in the end suzuki ultimately felt that fans deserved a full shenmue experience by early the pieces were falling into place sega licensed the property to suzuki and sony was interested in supporting the designer by promoting his kickstarter during its presentationi was really worried about how yu suzuki was going to be managing the budget of shenmue iiiafter the announcement more than fans flocked to that kickstarter project pledging more than six million dollars suzuki holds up the guinness world record he earned for fastestgrowing crowdfunding campaign its clear that he is proud of shenmues kickstarter success and while six million dollars was a significant boost to suzukis moral it was still a pittance compared to shenmues previous budgetsbecause i a fan i remember reading about the immense budget of shenmue and how that might have led to the franchise longstanding hibernation says payton i was really worried about how yu suzuki was going to be managing the budget of shenmue iii and maybe unfairly he has really done an incredible job building a really big game with a relatively small budget but again yu suzuki is a visionary and he very stubborn he does not want to compromisein the previous shenmue games i had a bigger team and because those team members kept bringing new ideas to the game i had to continually change or correct things adds suzuki there were many redos we were doing things again and again and again for shenmue iii i more involved directly in the details and all the elements of the game so there is much less to redo as a result the effectiveness of development is much higher than the originalsits pm in tokyo and the weather is sweltering were stuck in traffic on the way from ys nets offices in shinagawa city to a dinner reservation in yokahomas chinatown tokyos traffic system is still reeling from the typhoon and our commute has turned into a crawl across the yokohama bay bridge hot and frustrated yu suzuki pulls out his phone and begins watching an episode of the nbc crime thriller the blacklist suzuki is a big fan he thinks the show is incredibly well made later on we all watch the first episode of fuller house and laugh about the absurdity of being trapped in a car with a legendary japanese developer while watching american sitcoms full house is the foundation of shenmue jokes suzuki the car ride is surreal but its another opportunity to pick suzukis brainsuzuki finds a lot of inspiration for his games while watching television and movies during the creation of the original shenmue suzuki watched one movie a day on average for over two years he cites films like casablanca and my neighbor totoro as inspirations not specifically for their story but for what they taught him about storytelling and character development shenmue iii is after all largely a character studyshenmue tells the story of ryo hazuki a stoic young man whose father is murdered before his eyes by a highranking member of a chinese cartel a man named lan di wracked with grief ryo sets off on a oneman quest to track down lan di and avenge his father this quest takes ryo out of his small town in japan and into the heart of mainland chinashenmue iii picks up the story after ryo has met a mysterious young woman named shenhua ling shenhuas fate is similar to ryos in that her father has been kidnapped by the same criminal organization that employees lan di the two join forces track down shenhuas father and get to the bottom of this mystery togetherryo will discover that somewhere in the past his father visited shenhuas village and that there are some secrets there says suzuki ryos father was hunting for something there thats another layer of the mystery how was his father involved with lan diwe catch up with ryo after he travels to a large riverside village known as guilin this idyllic town is full of classiclooking temples and sloping tiled roofs suzuki says this village is about percent of the way into the main storyline and that it holds several important clues that will help ryo track down lan dias with the previous shenmue games players can unravel this main mystery at their own pace and there are plenty of activities to distract them while theyre at it the town of guilin is dense with over shops arcades hotels and temples players can spend days gambling on minigames such as the pachinkoesque lucky hit get a parttime job driving a forklift fish along the riverfront collect herbs and hunt for hidden ingame collectiblesas ryo wanders guilins streets we take in the local city life steam pours off the grills of a local food vendor as a group of monks practice their martial arts in a nearby courtyard we walk past a couple and listen to them bicker about the size of their hotel room the husband promises to buy his wife anything she wants from the market ryo peeks through the windows of a nearby apartment building and catches a man flexing in the mirror suzuki tells us that this character is actually modeled after a kickstarter backer finally at the end of the block ryo enters a local arcade where he can kill time by playing a variety of mechanical amusements and digital arcade games one boxing game invites ryo to test his might by punching padded targets at the other end of the room is a parody of virtua fighter starring cutesy birds called chobuchannaturally ryos daily errands are occasionally interrupted by a quicktime action sequence or an allout bar brawl shenmues original combat system was based on virtua fighter and felt a little complex to those who didnt play a lot of fighting games shenmue iiis combat on the other hand has been completely reworked and feels less rigid than previous incarnationswe rebuilt shenmue iiis combat from scratch says suzuki its much more fun to play and more approachable even if you don have much skill were using some ai elements so even if youre just randomly pushing buttons something meaningful will happenwithout practice we jumped into the game and worked our way up a tournament ladder with ease our first opponent is a small young man with a shaved head he comes out strong with a flurry of punches but we dodge to the side and unleash a combo of our own against his exposed side and he crumples to the floor ryos movements feel natural and responsive and we have no problem stringing together simple combos from a mix of light and heavy attacksour second opponent is an older gentleman with a pompadour and a pencilthin mustache hes a bit more imposing than our first matchup fortunately ryo has a few more tricks up his sleeve in addition to traditional combos ryo has access to a number of prebuilt attacks that can be performed with the tap of the right bumper players can choose which attack is set to the combo button these attacks range from grappling to highflying spin kicks but they almost always do a great deal of damage we use a prebuilt combo that ends with a wicked roundhouse to break through our opponents defenses and send him to his kneesafter a few more matches ryo starts to run out of steam thankfully using a shortcut on the dpad were able to consume various foods which restore a bit of ryos health midbattle naturally ryo can also expand his move set and strengthen his basic attacks by training at a kwoon or participating in local tournaments while it remains to be seen if shenmues story will be worth the wait we walk away from our demo feeling better knowing that shenmues action has never felt betterto be honest i don play many other games confides suzuki before dinner if you say you like chinese food you probably mean that you like to eat chinese food but what i like is the cooking of the food not the eating in most cases in the gaming industry the guys who create the games also like playing games but in my case i really just love to create so the way i develop is very different from ordinary game developerssuzuki is referring to his attention to mundane details shenmues specialty is its focus on the minutia of daily life players are free to get lost in ryos artificial world to collect meaningless figurines and chug soda fans appreciate these unusual aspects of shenmue not because they fill some arbitrary ingame checklist or bring them closer to the games credits but because these tiny details conjure a deeper sense of verisimilitudeshenmues world isnt real but it feels realfor shenmue iii i wanted to create images so strong that you could smell the colors in the countryside says suzuki for me its very important to create those images where you can feel the moisture or humidity if possible i wanted to create a sense of smell in the gamefor shenmue iii i wanted to create images so strong that you could smell the colors in the countryside says suzukias if highlighting this fact one of the first things suzuki showed us during our shenmue iii demo were its weather effects the designer notes how rain creates tiny beads of moisture on ryos jacket a weather system might seem fairly standard for a modern openworld game but these little details excite suzuki later on while exploring ryos hotel room suzuki points out that players can make international phone calls to characters from the first two shenmue games ryo can also open every drawer in his room and examine knickknacks that serve no purpose to the story and when players want to add something to ryos inventory the character must pick up each object individually and physically move them with his handsthese little details might add to shenmues sense of realism but they are also the insufficient details that most designers sacrifice to speed up the action suzuki on the other hand doesnt see how you could make a game any other wayin the real world if you see some door and you want to open it you open it in the real world you can touch and move everything says suzuki because i dont play other games i think its very natural to interact with everything the keyword i often use is reality shenmue isnt necessarily true to reality but it is a reality you can trust as if almost real that what i consider entertainment somewhere between true and false is a reality that were trying to hit people may think that i trying to create something real but it not truly real its a new reality that i creatingyu suzuki isnt a conventional game designer several times during our trip suzuki admitted that he doesnt enjoy playing video games in fact before working at sega suzuki had never played a video game better still the designer only accepted segas job offer because the company offered more vacation time than his other prospects orthodox or not suzuki is still a game designer who knows what he wants he doesnt care how other developers make their games he knows what kind of game he wants to make and shenmue is unflinching in that vision to give players a window into the life of ryo hazuki both the actionpacked highlights and the quiet simple momentsi think yu suzuki was at peak auteur status when he built the original shenmue says payton you could see him trying to innovate in so many areas i think successfully in many of those areas whether its the kind of openworld nature of the game or the need to plot out your day or the ability to interact with the world in unique ways they all added to the overall feeling of simulation i think it was a little bit confusing for players and for critics but like a lot of great art as time goes on we able to look back and recognize just how special shenmue waswith a relatively small budget suzuki looks to deliver another game that fits the mold he established years ago shenmue iii features a more refined graphics engine and some welcome improvements to the combat system but the core experience remains full of the idiocrasies and daily distractions that shenmue fans love yu suzuki doesnt care how the industry has evolved over the last years he knows what he wants moreover he knows what shenmue fans wantnear the end of our trip after wed trudged through japans chinatown suzuki takes us to one of his favorite restaurants we point at a picture of deliciouslooking gyoza but suzuki waves us off and takes control of the menu hes going to order for us after all yu suzuki is a man who knows what he wants we dont eat gyoza that
