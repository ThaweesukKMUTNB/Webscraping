techradar,2022/05/04,https://www.techradar.com/news/elon-musk-buys-twitter,you don even need characters to deliver this momentous news elon musk just bought twitterthe tesla ceo and spacex founder has been circling the popular social media platform for weeks using twitter itself as a medium to announce both his intentions and ongoing frustrations with the platform in its current formnow after lining up the funds his own and hefty support from morgan stanley musk will pay billion roughly per share in a tender offer that gives him control of the company the deal now faces regulatory approvalwith twitter earnings report just days away it likely the new owner will show up during the company earnings call at least just to say hi and demurely refuses to answer most analysts questions directlyin a release on the acquisition musk said free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy and twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debatedi also want to make twitter better than ever by enhancing the product with new features making the algorithms open source to increase trust defeating the spam bots and authenticating all humans twitter has tremendous potential i look forward to working with the company and the community of users to unlock iti hope that even my worst critics remain on twitter because that is what free speech meansapril taylor twitter independent board chair noted in the release that the proposed transaction will deliver a substantial cash premium and we believe it is the best path forward for twitter stockholdersparag agrawal twitter ceo and the person who may end up working most closely with musk said in the release twitter has a purpose and relevance that impacts the entire world deeply proud of our teams and inspired by the work that has never been more important he notably did not reference musk directlymusk triumph comes after a circuitous path to ownership first he bought almost of twitter shares giving him a seat at the table and inviting him to the board musk accepted and then just as quickly backed out but he wasn finished soon he was offering billion for the company which prompted twitter board to adopt a poisonpill plan that would have sold cheaper shares to shareholders hadmusk sought to purchase more than of the company sharessoon after musk who has been on the platform since returned to a tender offer which meant he need to pull together all the money to buy the company as of last week musk secured the funds and over the weekend musk and twitter executive team met in person to hammer out the detailsnot everyone is thrilled at the prospect of a muskowned twitter in the runup to the announcement was trending on the platformas for what comes next musk has made clear his intentions to ensure that twitter supports free speech from all sides the implication being that it currently does not though there is no empirical evidence to support thishe may revisit some user bans including that of former president trumphe likely opensource twitter codea fan of blockchain and nfts musk might push the platform more aggressively into the crypto spacebut investors and backers will be most interested in musk growth plan twitter has done a decent job of generating more revenue from existing users but its growth has in recent years been relatively slow and flat it not clear that twitter could ever have the broadbased global appeal of say facebook which has its own growth struggles or tiktokit unclear what musk can do to reenergize some of twitter biggest celebrity accountsmusk will probably fasttrack the alreadyunderdevelopment tweet edits feature since he made it clear during the acquisition effort that he a fanwhat happens next depends on elon musk or rather the elon musk who shows up to run twitter will it be the brilliant sure hand that through spacex regularly ferries astronauts and supplies to the international space station the man who basically created the ev market with teslamaybeit might also be the man who impulsively tweets his inner id and ego who jokes that the next twitter board meet gonna be lit with a picture of him smoking a joint on joe rogan podcastthere sometimes seems to be little middle ground for musk who is both extremely successful and rich and extremely impulsive and emotionalthe fear that musk will let the worst element back on twitter nazis trolls antivaxxers donald trump and so on is real a freespeech absolutist might demand all voices be heard even the dangerous onesstill musk doesn truly know the inner workings of twitter extensive and still flawed content moderation system he soon will that may inspire some different and more rational thinking about how to excite and energize twitter for the future while protecting the most vulnerable who still use it every daycorrection april earlier headline for this story indicated that elon musk had completed his purchase of twitter the deal

techradar,2022/05/04,https://www.techradar.com/news/google-pixel-watch,could the google pixel watch finally be happening admittedly we been hearing rumors on it for years and years but excitement is once again growing for the anticipated alphabet smartwatchwith google io scheduled for may and with google ceo confirming that new products from the company will be shown off and especially in light of multiple recent leaks of the pixel watch there a lot of hope right nowthis is expected to be a grand showcase for wear os in the same way that pixel phones are a showcase for the android operating system showing just how the google software is meant to work on a native device given the wearable operating system big update from last year google io showcase we figured the watch wasn far behind flash forward a year and we think it finally cominghere everything we know so far about the upcoming watch as well as a list of the features we like from the first flagship google watch where are we google wearapril more leaks have dripped out potentially revealing the pixel watch battery size and connectivity optionsapril three different pixel watch models have been certified and we now have a clearer idea of the possible priceapril apparently a google pixel watch was left in a restaurant and now we have loads of pictures of the thing as a resultapril we could also see a pixel watch fit with a high price and leaked photos may have given us a look at the pixel watchapril a trademark for the pixel watch name has now been filed by google in another sign that it coming soonapril as per wellrespected leakerevan blass it won be long now before we see the wearable get its official unveiling by google blass also cites the pixel apparent code name pixel rohanmarch are we still waiting

shortage might push back the launch of the pixel watch insiders warnjan watch for thewatchto make its grand debut on may says jon prosser who says this is the first we seen a date set on the device behind the scenesdec a recent google app update mentions a pixelexperiencewatch strongly suggesting googles first smartwatch will have pixel branding and suggesting some wear os features will be exclusive to the pixel watchdec newly spotted watch faces include the wearer current step count heart rate and local weather conditions and one has the fitbit logo positioned prominently at the bottomdec a source familiar with the project claims the pixel watch will arrive in the report doesn offer details on when in the year don hold your breathoct the latest pixel event saw the launch of the pixel pixel pro and loads of details about the new os but sigh no pixel watchan exact release date for the rumored google pixel watch isn clear just predictions based on leaks one report from insider claims to have spoken to people familiar with the matter who suggest it coming in and more recently we heard that may will be the big day perhaps during google io wearable has also reportedly been spotted on a carrier inventory system in the us suggesting they preparing it for sale making a may launch looking more likelythat said a tweet from noted leaker evleaks claimed a reliable source said it would be announced alongside the google pixel and pixel xl back in then a rumor claimed the google watch would land on october at the pixel launch but of course neither happened and we still waitingone recent report suggests that the global chip shortage is going to push the google pixel launch back from may to late july and that the pixel watch is going to shift as well to match the same schedule one report hints that the wearable will appear with the pixel in octoberwe fairly confident that such a watch is definitely in the works though and it possible that the pixel watch could benefit from google acquisition of fitbit which could see the latter company wearable skills put towards google smartwatch hardwarebetter still at google io the company announced that wear os is integrating features from samsung tizen os which could suggest what coming in the google watchwe also heard that google has reportedly ordered processors from samsung according to etnews which would be capable of detecting body movements there no guarantee that these are for a smartwatch they could be for a pixel phone but a wearable would be an obvious fit that then is strong evidence that some form of pixel watch is in the workshowever it might not launch everywhere with one source saying it will get a limited release though the us and uk look likely to be includedas for price one leak puts the price of a watch fit at around roughly that would put it inline with the apple watch but it not clear if this is the main pixel watch or a spinoffa slightly more recent price leak has now said that it could cost between roughly and first real pixel watch design leak came from leaker jon prosser who shared an image showing the wearable with a physical crown followed up with a batch of rendered images based on info provided by a source which show potentially the first full looks at the pixel watch supposed design here the full video of prosser revealper the renders the pixel watch looks like a circular smartwatch with a bezelless display no buttons and a single physical crown on the right side the renders also recreate the suggested interface including a watch face with radial time markers giving it an analog timepiece look the apps look very simple suggesting google could be going for a more elegant minimalist designwe since seen what is supposedly a leaked image from google marketing department showing off what the pixel watch is going to look like you can check it out below the lack of bezel and the minimal design matches up with the unofficial renders we also seenwe also now seen leaked photos of what appears to be the pixel watch in the flesh these show it in black with a circular screen a thick build and small bezels they also show a crown at least one physical button and a proprietary strap connectorfinally a us carrier has listed the wearable as coming in gray black and gold shadeswe starting to get quite a clear picture in terms of the specs of the google pixel watch recent leaks have revealed that the wearable will come with a battery like the fossil gen and offer cellular connectivity on at least one model so you can make and receive calls even when your phone isn connectedone source suggests it will use a chipset likely the same one as the samsung galaxy watch has since then more evidence of a samsung exynos chip has emerged so this is likelya carrier inventory system also lists the wearable as coming with of storage and its presence there suggests there will probably be a cellular version as this carrier has never sold a noncellular smartwatchelsewhere possible watch faces for the pixel watch have also leaked showing things like step counts heart rate and the weather interestingly one also includes a fitbit logo suggesting the pixel watch could incorporate some fitbit featuresthere other evidence that there could be a big focus on fitness too both because google has bought fitbit and because google sent out a survey asking people about features they like to see in wear os and those features included things like oxygenation tracking sleep apnea detection sleep analysis heartbeat alerts recovery time monitoring stress tracking pairing for medical devices and gym equipment rep detection and calorie trackingof course it unlikely they would all be added but some may well be and it shows that google is thinking about health and fitnessone rumored feature was something codenamed it was thought to be be a power management integrated circuit built into the chipset itself that will allow the watch to listen out for voice commands at all times without draining the batteryif this does appear expect to be able to ask google assistant questions without either draining your smartwatch after a few hours or having to press a button beforehandsimilarly we now heard that the pixel watch might support ondevice processing for google assistant which could speed the service up a newlook design for assistant has also leaked as you can see belowanother report this time from winfuture has suggested there may actually be three versions of the pixel watch in development the website has heard word of devices with code names ling triton and sardine all in development at google hqexactly what the differences for the devices would be are currently unclear it may mean we see three variants of the pixel watch that same report also suggested at least one version of the watch will come with of ramthis report could mean there will be one watch in the range with lte or another that designed to be more focused on fitness this report is also quite old now so it may no longer be relevantthat said three different pixel watch models seem to have now been certified and we heard that there could be a spinoff called the pixel watch fit one source also points to two different sizes of watch which is another way the models could differwe also seen a google patent which details a gesture control system that would allow a smartwatch to detect movements you make with your arm wrist or fingersfor example you could make a fist to launch google assistant and open the fist to dismiss it these gestures would be done on the arm or hand that the watch is worn on however patents aren always used so there no guarantee we see thisbelow we put together a list of the things we want to see from the google pixel watchbefore the switch to wear os android wear put a big focus on how the design had been reworked to play well with rotating bezels and crowns but then we haven seen many watches embrace thatwhy not use it for the google pixel watch those features may be far in google rear view mirror as the wear os updates take precedent but we love to see an innovative way of interacting with the watch such as a rotating crown or bezelif google really wants to put the pixel watch on the map adding an indisplay fingerprint scanner would go a long way to doing that currently wear os watches and the apple watch allow you to secure them with a pin code but thats not the most secure form of protection availablewith an indisplay fingerprint scanner the secure biometric technology would fit seamlessly into the wearable without disrupting the visual appeal of the watch it would also allow you to approve purchases over the current contactless limit assuming the pixel watch comes with nfcthere are a couple of potential negatives here though firstly the addition of this fledgling technology could increase the thickness of the watch and no one wants an overly chunky wearable but secondly itll also likely push the price tag way upif google can overcome these two things though you can sign us up for a pixel watch right nowwere used to smartwatches coming with a level of dust and water resistance but few carry an ip certification high enough to ensure their survival when we cannonball into the local poola fully swimproof google pixel watch would not only allow you to keep the wearable on in the bath but also allow you to track workouts in the pool without fear of malfunctionthis is a simple one but we want the google pixel watch to last as long as it can imagine a fully fledged smartwatch that doesn need charging after two days of intensive usagewear os is integrating a useful enhanced battery saver mode that should give you a lot more time with your smartwatch but it limit the amount of features you can use when it onclearly google wants to improve how long your watch will last from one charge but we love to see a big battery inside the watch and well optimized software that offers the best battery for a smartwatch on the market right nowanother simple one here but quite a few wear os watches don come with nfc built in so you aren able to use google pay features on your wrist that a frustration for a lot of people so we hoping google will include an nfc chip inside the watchthat especially be useful when you out for a run and you need to buy a bottle of water but you left your wallet at homewhile we on the topic of running we want the pixel watch to compete with the fitness prowess of the apple watch as well as topend specialist watches like the garmin forerunner if google can include all of the latest tracking tech including accurate gps lte so we can listen to music on the go as well as a top of the range heart rate trackerwe want to be able to strap the google pixel watch to our wrist and head out for any type of exercise and know we be tracked accurately and get as much fitness stats as we possibly canthis one is a given but we want to see a watch that you not embarrassed to wear on your wrist not every wear os watch is a gorgeous creation so we wish google will be able to offer a slimmer option than most other manufacturers that uses highend materials and feels like a proper timepiece you excited to wearif you going to be spending a fair amount of money on a new watch you want it to look great on your wrist so this is one of the most important things we want to see on the new wearable,Google Pixel Watch: here's everything we know so far,en,787.0,Positive

techradar,2022/05/04,https://www.techradar.com/news/iphone-14,we hearing iphone leaks almost every day now and the successor to the iphone sounds like it have an interesting twist not only have we heard that the mini is going in favor of a max version but the standard and pro models might have more differences than ever before likely to land in september a new iphone max in place of an iphone mini no notch for the iphone pro and pro max similar designs to the iphone range for the basic models two roughly phones and two phones cameras on pro models bigger batteries possibly the bionic chipset but maybe the have a surprisingly clear picture of the form the iphone range might take though this far from launch wed be extra skeptical as theres plenty of time for things to changebut the rumors so far are promising pointing to a completely new design for the iphone pro and iphone pro max a totally new model dubbed the iphone max and some significant camera upgradesbelow you find everything we heard about the iphone so far including details about the potential release date and priceand as soon as we hear anything else about the iphone well add it to this article so make sure to check back here soon as leaks are rolling in at a surprisingly rapid rate alreadyapr more iphone renders show a device with punchhole cameras but ones that are bigger than we seen in previous imagesapr we heard that the iphone standard not pro could be made by a different company which should ensure that iphones are easier to buy why check out our coverage for our reasoningap we heard that the iphone won get usbc and will stick with a lightning port again but with faster data transfer speeds than beforeapr apparently the iphone could get two frontfacing camera upgrades hardware autofocus as well as a bigger aperture these could make selfies that little bit betterapr an interesting rumor has suggested that when the iphone debuts the iphone will be discontinued it currently sold as an affordable alternative to the topend models given that phone age it a rumor that makes sensemore of the latest iphone tidbits apr a leaker has reiterated claims that the iphone max is joining the series a move which result in the iphone mini getting bumpedmar the iphone range has reportedly entered the engineering validation stage meaning it on schedulemar the iphone pro and pro max might have larger camera bumps thanks to a new sensormar you know that report from march that said that only the pro iphone would get a new chipset well apparently the standard models will get the but with its name changed to we seen even more iphone sketches that point to there being no notch however apparently the iphone will have underdisplay face idmar yet another leak points to there being no iphone mini however it also suggests the upcoming devices will have displays that are a touch smaller than their iphone equivalentsmar leaked cad renders suggest that the dual cutout camera design on the front of the pro models will be happening but that the rear might not changemar apple will reportedly only use a new chipset in the top iphone models with the others getting last yearfeb a look at the pill and punch hole replacement for the notch on the pro models comes courtesy of a leaked schematicfeb production has apparently started a report claims that apple has begun trial production of the iphone range alreadyjan esim only an analyst predicts that apple might launch a version of the iphone that only has an esim meaning no removable sim card they claim that the company would release versions with physical sim cards too so buyers have a choicejan all the way round every edition of the iphone will come with a promotion display one analyst believes a feature that is currently an exclusive on the pro and pro max models when it comes to theiphone the notch is dead long live cutouts apple will incorporate both a circular and pillshaped camera cutout on the front display of the iphone pro and pro max handsets says a supplychain expert and the smaller hole will not be invisiblejan hold onto your wallet if you can believe the rumors the iphone will cost in the us the same price theiphone at and the pro and pro max will get even more expensiveiphone release date there aren any release date rumors yet but apple almost always unveils new iphone models in septemberiphone price pricing is unknown but for reference the iphone started at and prices may be similar for the next modelsdesign the iphone will probably look a lot like the iphone but the iphone pro and pro max could get a punchhole camera instead of a notch there might also be a bigscreen iphone max in place of an iphone minidisplay the iphone and iphone pro could have or x oled screens while the iphone max and iphone pro max could have or x oled screens expect a refresh rate on the pro models and a refresh rate on the otherscamera the iphone pro and pro max could have main cameras up from on the current models other specs are unclear but a triplelens snapper on all but the standard iphone is likely with the basic phone instead having two rear lensesspecs every iphone model is expected to have a powerful bionic chipset but the pro models could additionally have of ram up from a maximum of currently and up to of storage up from a current maximum of little is known about the battery yet but there are claims that the capacity could increase with the phones getting thicker to house their larger batteriestheres no news on when the iphone will be released yet but we can take a very good guess at this as apple tends to announce new models around the same time each year usually at a special eventthe iphone was unveiled on september and it shipped on september while we probably wont see the iphone on those exact dates in apple tends to unveil the new models on either the first or second tuesday in september which would mean either september or september they usually go up for preorder the friday of that week meaning september or and ship the following friday so september or apple will announce the phones on the first or second wednesday instead but around those dates seems very likely anyway the iphone range was an exception to this landing in october but that was thanks to delays and supply issues caused by far it doesn look like there will be delays this year with trial production apparently having already started as of late february and the engineering validation stage supposedly having been entered as of late march which is on schedulewe heard one iphone price leak which detailed four members of the new range with a max included but no miniapparently the base phone will start at the iphone starts at so that fits with the iphone max going for more than that we similarly elsewhere heard that the iphone will have a similar starting price to the iphone iphone pro and pro max are said to go for and respectively which would mean each would be more than the starting price of their predecessorsthe biggest news on the iphone design comes from one big leak which includes unofficial renders of the iphone pro maxyou can see one of these below and it includes a punchhole camera instead of a notch with the face id components presumably being under the screen it also doesnt really have a camera bump with the lenses sitting almost flat on the back a thing that is apparently achieved by making the phone thickerthe back is a semiglossy glass the volume buttons are shown to be round and it apparently has titanium sides in place of stainless steel on the iphone pro max you can also see that theres still a triplelens camera and a lightning portthe colors shown here arent official though the source claims to have seen a rose gold model and its worth also noting that this design is thought to only apply to the pro models with the iphone and iphone max if there is one likely to still have a notch its not currently clear which if any of the other design details here could make it to the standard modelswe would of course take this with a huge helping of salt especially as it comes from jon prosser who has a mixed track record and as another source has said the iphone pro range will still have a notch albeit a smaller one possibly as well as a punchholebut prosser is often right and both mark gurman and mingchi kuo two leakers with excellent track records for apple information have since said that the notch will be replaced with a punchhole camera as more recently has the elecanother leaker has chimed in to say the same too though they claim that the camera cutout will be pillshaped suggesting that it might be bigger than most punchhole camerasross young a supplychain expert in the world of smartphone displays has said he believes the company will adopt a hole pill design of the iphone pro and iphone pro max that will mean a pillshaped cutout as well as a smaller hole that will still be visible a theory backed up with a leaked schematic cut outmore sources have now agreed with this and leaked cad renders visible below show this design too though they don show the rear camera changes you can see further upin fact the iphone pro and pro max might actually have a slightly bigger camera bump than the iphone pro range according to leaked schematics this is reportedly due to the use of a new sensor more on which further downall that said gurman has said the iphone range will include a holepunchsized notch and it not clear from that whether he means a small notch or an actual punchhole so there still some uncertainty about the designelsewhere weve heard that the pro models could use a titanium alloy for their frame this would likely be stronger than the materials used in current models and this source also claims there will be an iphone max in place of an iphone minireputable leaker mingchi kuo claims that there will be two iphone models a standard one and a pro and two ones a pro max and a maxweve also heard more detailed screen specs from ross young another leaker with a good track record young claims that the iphone will have a x oled screen with a refresh rate and pixels per inch the iphone pro will apparently have similar screen specs but with a variable refresh ratethen the iphone pro max is said to have a x oled screen with a refresh rate and pixels per inch theres also apparently going to be an iphone max taking the place of the mini with basically the same screen specs but a refresh rateanother source has also suggested that the two cheaper models will be stuck with screens just like in the current range that said we more recently heard that apple is considering a screen for the iphone max but that the decision hasn yet been madea leak has also suggested that all four iphone models could have screens this is quite an old leak and is at odds with one above but this claim has been made again more recently so we not sure what right hereand theres also a patent for a technology that could make the iphone screen stronger without making it any thicker that would be a nice addition but patents often dont turn into anything so dont count on seeing thison the camera front the unofficial renders above show the iphone pro max with a triplelens camera and indeed another source also points to that phone and the iphone pro and iphone max having a triplelens camera the iphone meanwhile will apparently stick with two lensesso that doesnt sound like much change from the iphone range though the specifications of the lenses and sensors may well differindeed mingchi kuo an analyst with a great track record for apple information has claimed that the iphone pro and pro max will each have a main camera up from on the current models this would apparently be capable of recording video and it something he more recently reiterated and in december reiterated again so he seems very sure of thisplus another analyst has also joined kuo in that claim saying that they expect both the pro models in to feature cameras that isn confirmation but it certainly helps kuo original claimthere are also rumors of a periscope camera in the works for long range optical zoom and weve even seen a patent supporting these claims however most sources suggest this is further out probably landing on the iphone or laterone thing were almost certain of is that the iphone range will have a new chipset probably called the or the bionic according to ross young this would be made on a process which suggests it could be a reasonable boost on the bionic in the iphone rangein fact the process could even be moved down to according to digitimes via macrumorsthat said we more recently heard that a process could be used once again as tsmc the company that producing the chipset is apparently struggling to switch to a or processwe also heard that potentially only the iphone pro and iphone pro max would get this chipset with the basic models being stuck with the bionic the same source says to expect of ram in every model that split in chipsets has now been mentioned by multiple sourcesanother leak also suggests both the iphone pro and iphone pro max will feature of ram of ram is the most we seen on an iphone so far though we elsewhere heard that every model will have of ram which would be an upgrade for the cheaper ones but not for the pro handsetson the storage front the pro models of the iphone increased the maximum amount of internal storage you could buy from to and we hearing that the iphone pro phones could double that again all the way to that some sources reckon we could see underdisplay touch id on the iphone though mark gurman a leaker with a great track record for apple information has said that while apple apparently tested this the company is now allin on face id so it sounds like this probably wont happen and if it does its likely to be as well as face id rather than insteadanother source has also said underdisplay face id won happen so this looks very unlikelyanother rumored but unlikely feature is a switch from a lightning port to usbc apple is reportedly considering this for the iphone pro and iphone pro max but as yet only one source has pointed in this direction so we skepticalwhat the iphone range is sure to include though is support while a patent suggests it might also have a new form of touch which would use haptic feedback to make interactions more intuitive but as with all patents we wouldnt count on anything coming of this onethere also talk that apple could switch from a physical sim card to an esim which you wouldn be able to remove the iphone range already has this but it in addition to a physical one not instead however if apple does go esimonly with any iphone it will probably also offer models that have both kindsin terms of the battery it sounds like there could be improvements there with one source saying it will be larger in the next models and another saying the phones will be thicker which could leave room for a larger onewhen it comes time to charge you might be making use of a magsafe charger rather than the lightning port based on one patent though notably early unofficial renders show the lightning port intactwe surprised if apple did ditch the lightning port on the iphone but a new eu plan could mean that its days are numbered,Apple iPhone 14: here's everything we

new virtual reality vr and augmented reality ar headsets following on the huge success of the oculus quest will be project cambria a topoftheline headset currently in development from metaproject cambria was first announced at the meta connect conference in october dubbed the oculus quest pro by eager fans and pundits project cambria is a highend virtual reality and augmented reality hybrid headset this would make it distinct from the oculus quest and eventual oculus quest in being aimed at for the pro and enthusiast end of the mixedreality marketmeta boss mark zuckerberg described it as a completely new advanced and highend product which will sit at the higher end of the price spectrumwith apple said to also be working on highend virtual and augmented reality devices not to mention the imminent launch of the playstation vr headset from sony meta will be looking to shore up its position across the spectrum of all things vrinterested you should be heres everything you need to know about project cambria so farmay metas vr hardware roadmap has leaked giving us details about its next four headsets including the price and specs of its next vr headsetproject cambriaapril on a recent meta earnings call mark zuckerberg said project cambria will focus on productivity rather than playing video games over time the meta ceo hopes that itll replace our laptop and work setupapril the roughly meta quest gaming showcase highlighted several exciting newquest gamesthat are headed our way over the coming year including among us vr and cities vr no mention of new hardware howeverapril

soon according to a statement from the vice president of meta reality labs andrew bosworth but those leaks weren wrong just premature bosworth said will it come to cambriafeb the most recent release of the quest software development kit sdk a set of tools designed to help the platform game and app developers includes an option for tracking supportoct as part of facebook push to introduce multiple new mixed reality products advancing the state of the art in years to come mark zuckerberg lifted the lid on oculus next vr headset atfacebook connect project cambriadespite the secrecy shrouding project cambria we have surprisingly detailed information about what it will cost and when the device will be available meta has committed to a release for the headsetbut when precisely that launch will take place is hard to pin down we know we know the original oculus quest launched in may of with the oculus quest following in october thats roughly months apart by that reckoning may of would seem an appropriate guessdevelopment timelines between products can be different of course and with the ongoing pandemic and supply chain issues plaguing all kinds of consumer tech products we wouldnt bet the house on any datewhat is guaranteed by zuckerbergs own admission is that this will be a more expensive device than the oculus quest and a leaked internal road map published by the information suggests that project cambria will cost around and will be about as powerful as a chromebook and it will run on metas own androidbased operating systemmeta has been candid already about what to expect from the project cambria hardware which will be markedly more advanced than any oculus headset that came before itbased on thebest chromebooksyou can currently buy as well as the specs of the meta quest it sounds like project cambria will have at least ram and likely around gb of storage well also likely see its processor get a boost too but meta may have to design its own chip as qualcomm has yet to launch a followup to the snapdragon that powers metas quest also previously heard that cambria will incorporatedual mini led displaysthat will likely offer a refresh rate to improve upon the quest experimental featureunofficial renders based on the supply chain emerged in mid april and appear to show a forwardfacing camera it thought that this will enable mixed reality or augmented reality support where digital elements are overlaid over scenes in the real worldbeyond the speeds and feeds we know project cambria will be a standalone wireless headset thats not to say it wont be able to connect to a pc for pc vr experiences or even connect wirelessly to a powerful host pc like the oculus link feature but since the end of the oculus rift line in metas focus has purely been on cablefree out of the box at least vr hardware this will also set it apart from the upcoming playstation vr which will not only be more of an entrylevel device but will also still need a wire to connect it to the consolemeta was apparently working on the development of a combined arvr operating system and hit pause on it back in february so the upcoming headset will not have a completely new software platform arriving along with it according to the latest rumors based on leaked internal road maps project cambria will run on metas own androidbased operating systemone muchrequested feature will finally get its moment in the spotlight eye tracking its an important aspect of the way humans interact with the world and a readilyexploitable tool for developers of advanced virtual reality applications with eyetracking devs have another form of user input to play with not only letting them better understand where a users gaze is focused and tailor interactive experiences appropriately but also to take full advantage of foveated renderingin short foveated rendering makes sure that the area of the display a user is focused on is displayed in the greatest possible detail while the surrounding areas of a virtual environment arent shown in such high fidelity much like how the human eye masks peripheral vision it can be used to maximize device resource usage pumping processing power only onto the fidelity of objects and areas that a users gaze is interacting with its a hugely exciting part of the futurevr puzzlelikewise face tracking will be on board project cambria this will allow ingame avatars to mimic your facial expressions in real time potentially even opening up accessibility functions such as lip reading so far however both eye tracking and facial tracking are mainly expected to be used for avatarbased features but their potential usage could go way beyond thatmany of these features can be seen in action in the video below what is believed to be an orientation video for new users of the project cambria headset which leaked ahead of the announcement for project cambriaproject cambria will go beyond virtual reality experiences however and will lean ever more into the augmented reality features that are increasingly becoming available to oculus quest userssupporting this will be the introduction of high resolution color passthrough features the oculus quest uses an array of headmounted cameras to present the world outside of your headset on the internal displays primarily for safely tracking your realworld play space in real time but the current quest devices can only offer a black and white view at a relatively low resolutionproject cambria will make this sharper and in color expanding the potential for augmented reality experiences its not quite the same as having transparent lenses as seen in hololens or the hibernating magic leap headsets but cambria augmented reality will also benefit from the expanded field of view that internal vr lenses can currently offer over transparent alternativesproject cambria while remaining a headmounted unit will look rather different from existing meta hardware thanks to the use of new lens typesthese pancake lenses have a thinner profile reportedly resulting from their use of mini led panels sharper and cooler to run this is expected to allow project cambrias front area to be much less bulky than that of the oculus quest boosting both comfort and resolutionwith a new industrial design afforded by the new lenses vr data miners have been able to reconstruct what they believe project cambria will look like by creating models from render textures you can find them in the video above and tweet belowproject cambria the sleuthing here points to the real product the headset will be returning to the darker outer shell design of older oculus devices with considerable shaving of the depth off the frontmost element of the headseta more pronounced padded forehead rest could be in the cards too as well as more padding on the rear part of the strap in conjunction with the apparent reduced weight these features could lead to a much more comfortable headset than the oculus quest taking cues from the rift s and playstation vr whose front forehead rests lead to very ergonomic fitsso what about the controllers in those rendersproject cambrias motion controllers look significantly different too while retaining the disconawand design the quest controllers have popularized youll note that cambria controllers appear to be lacking the tracking ring earlier models havethis seems to be afforded by the inclusion of infrared tracking cameras on the controllers themselves you can see this in both the above renders and the below apparent leaked controller photos all said to be from a facebook meta workplace video conference workplace is metas internal slack teams solutionwhether a prototype or a fake theres definitely a correlation between the texture renders and this controller which also suggests a white colorway may be in the cards for project cambria dropping the tracking rings would presumably lead to a lighter controller and reduce the friction between user and vr experience previous firmware leaks have suggested that some form of lasertracking system between the controllers and headset will ensure the two remain in sync and in communicationexpect hand tracking to increasingly be the norm in vr and ar too the tracking and processing improvements expected to be found in project cambria should help to make the device more accurate and comfortable in day to day userest assured that the oculus quest now more likely to be known as the meta quest will still likely launch as a separate offering from project cambriaspeaking with the information zuckerberg stressed that the oculus quest line has a long life ahead of it we have product teams spun up now working on the next few generations of virtual reality and what quest and are gonna look like zuckerberg stated on the podcastconsulting cto john carmack also reinforced the idea that project cambria represents an expansion of the line rather than a replacement to existing devices whose price point gives them wider appealan important point here is that the project cambria product will not replace quest it will be sold alongside it carmack said quest will have a long lifewhat will likely happen is that going forward project cambria will debut the most bleedingedge vr features for enthusiasts with those features being implemented later down the line in cheaper successive quest devicesthere are now thought to be as many as million oculus quest headsets in homes around the world and it appears meta has no intention of alienating its existing userbase by encouraging them to rebuy their vr libraries for any eventual project cambria headsetjust as oculus quest titles were compatible with oculus quest project cambria is said to have compatibility with the quest while meta hasnt explicitly referred to this as backwards compatibility its hard to understand this any other way certainly the aforementioned orientation video explicitly references beat saber in its visuals perhaps the most popular existing oculus quest title of allhow many of the newer headsets new features will be taken advantage of by the older software remains to be seen however though even a more

netflixs weekly popularity charts having scored more than million hours viewed in the past seven days anatomy of a scandal has become the first netflix show to knock bridgerton season from its perch and looks poised to remain in the top spot for several weeks to comeexcept its success isnt really a wonder at all in recent years netflix has perfected the art of trickster television series that attract audiences like moths to a flame with big names and moody marketing only to leave them unsatisfied but equally unwilling to bail on their time investment halfway through watchinggqs ben allen recently raised the same point in his description of the imposter a type of show that in his words has all the trappings of your glossy hbo faves huge stars silly budgets big ticket writers but veers closer to eastenders in depth and quality a trojan horse filled with human excrementokay maybe anatomy of a scandal isn quite that bad but it certainly doesn warrant more viewers than every other tv show streaming right nowof the myriad streaming services at customers disposal in netflix is the biggest offender when it comes to peddling belowpar series in such large quantities make no mistake the platform still has the capacity to produce awardsworthy television stranger things and sex education rank among the best in recent memory but its frequently lazy output has begun to grate on subscribers toying with the notion that their money might be better spent elsewherenetflix bosses know this in response to the news that the streamer has hemorrhaged paying customers since the beginning of ceo reed hastings told investors that the company plans to reaccelerate viewing and revenue growth by continuing to improve all aspects of netflix in particular the quality of its programminglike apple tv plus whose recent projects coda and severance have proven the value in investing in truly unique original programming netflix must now trust in the willingness of its viewers to embrace the unfamiliar and also give those original series that do break the mold time to breath before condemning them to the scrap heapbut it doesnt help the cause when shows like anatomy of a scandal defy their quality to become in the eyes of netflixs statisticians successful productions when these safe shallow series rake in million viewing hours in a single week their success risks justifying the streamers decision to cancel other genuinely interesting projects like those previously in development at its animation department that would immeasurably improve the quality of the service as a wholethere is therefore an awkward contradiction at play that raises several difficult to answer questions if these socalled imposters are consistently proving popular should netflix continue commissioning them in a bid to regain subscriber momentum do netflix customers who have so openly criticized the streamer and its recent content really care about the quality of the shows theyre watching or are the likes of anatomy of a scandal only ranking as the most popular on netflix because the options are so limitedto be clear netflix subscribers are not at fault here logic simply suggests that the company will look to replicate its big wins by doing just that producing homogeneous series that reap big viewership figures at the expense of critical disdain perhaps though acclaim is overrated if audiences are genuinely enjoying anatomy of a scandal and not simply sticking it out until the end then more power to netflixanatomy of a scandal is one of the worst tv shows ive ever seen so naturally im obsessed with itapril for our money the streamer must focus on quality over quantity moving forward if it hopes to fend off the increasingly fierce competition from rival platforms like disney plus and hbo max the companys imminent crackdown on password sharing and likely introduction of a cheaper adsupported subscription tier will go some way to mitigating its losses but as netflix well knows content is and always will be king,The success of Netflix’s latest drama compounds its problem with quality control,en,471.0,Positive
