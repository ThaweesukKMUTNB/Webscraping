polygon,2022/05/04,https://www.polygon.com/23055769/the-owl-house-reveal-season-2,The Owl House is proving itself to be too good for Disney,the owl houses past few episodes have showcased the series at its best as plucky misfit luz searches for a way home and also tries to get to the bottom of allpowerful emperor belos plans she grapples with her own emotions about being torn between two worlds its the perfect blend of worldbuilding backstory and characterfocused downtime to balance out the overarching plotbut even though the show has been at its best the fact that the last two episodes had a bunch of big reveals backtobacktoback is frustratingly bittersweet with only four episodes left of this season and only a tiny abridged third season on the horizon its clear that creator dana terrace and the rest of the owl house team are working within the framework handed to them its still deeply satisfying but the show and the team behind it deserve moreed note this article contains major spoilers for the most recent episodes of the owl housein hollow mind luz and hunter zeno robinson emperor belos dutiful nephew find themselves trapped in belos mindscape while trying to escape luz also decides to explore his memories and find out his motivations while hunter passionately insists that belos is good at heart they stumble across a small childlike belos who luz initially wants to protect but as they delve deeper into belos dark and twisted mind it becomes evident that his true intentions are evil he is actually a human witch hunter the very same human that luz went back in time to find in hopes that he could lead her home belos has been working with a shady spirit known as the collector and has somehow survived for hundreds of years in order to carry out his master plan of murdering all the witches and demons in the boiling isles and to top that all off hunter isnt actually his nephew but something he refers to as a grimwalker made in the appearance of one of belos first companions all those years agoif that wasnt enough the very next episode sees luz and baby demon king alex hirsch headed off to a distant part of the boiling isles where they meet a remote clan of titan hunters who are convinced that king is one of their longlost descendants as it turns out king isnt a titan hunter hes actually the last titan the giant fearsome demonic creatures who roamed the boiling isles centuries ago creatures that the aforementioned collector wants to eliminate its whammy after whammy but each of the revelations has been carefully seeded beforehand the king reveal builds on previous instances where we saw him search for his family while belos and hunters true nature was foreshadowed by their inability to wield magical traditionallybut with only a handful of episodes left this season and only an abridged season after this one wrapping them all up seems near impossible terrace and the rest of the crew have already defied odds crafting a gratifying and interesting narrative despite the limited scope handed to them theyve proved that they can pull off the unbelievable and can likely thread the needle to a satisfying ending and yet it could also be so much more had disney not decided to shaft the show before it even really got a chancegenerally disney channel animated shows tend to run for fewer seasons compared to other network counterparts take adventure time and steven universe for instance which clocked in at and episodes respectively not including their respective spinoff series and compare them to popular disney channel shows like gravity falls episodes and star vs the forces of evil episodes that isnt to say that you cant make a satisfying animated show with a smaller episode count its doable and certainly those two disney channel examples already speak to that but it does make it evident that the owl house was already operating under a more restrained storytelling allowance made even shorter by the fact that it wont be getting a full third seasonterrace previously offered some insight into why the owl house wasnt renewed for a full third season which boiled down to a frustratingly simple reason that had nothing to do with reviews all good or viewership also good someone decided that the show didnt fit disneys brandat the end of the day there are a few business people who oversee what fits into the disney brand and one day one of those guys decided toh didnt fit that brand wrote terrace in a reddit ama thread the story is serialized barely compared to any average anime lmao our audience skews older and that just didnt fit this one guys tastes thats it aint that wild really grinds my guts boils my brain kicks my shins all the things it sucks but it is what it ispulling off a lateshow reveal like steven universe did in its final season doesnt just come from the hard work of the creatives involved there were certainly moments along the way where it seemed like steven universe might not get a chance to tell its full story but it takes the network giving the show a chance to even get to that point the owl houses most recent reveals are amazing but imagine what they couldve been like with a little more time to stew hunter for instance was only really introduced this season and the revelation about what he really is comes smooshed in between other big reveals about belos it still works it works very well but its just hard to shake the fact that disney doesnt want it to work at allthe owl house is brilliant its sharp and funny with evocative worldbuilding and compelling characters its funny and heartful and gorgeously animated its garnered a passionate fan base and rave reviews and it became a milestone of lgbtq representation in allages animation its more grownup than the average disney channel animated series and for the better and if disney just had a little more faith trust and pixie dust etc etc then the owl house could have the time it deservesthe first season of the owl house as well as episodes through of season are available on disney plus new episodes premiere on saturdays at am edt on disney channel,en,476,Positive

collaboration with alcon entertainment and genuine entertainment it sends players into the streets of los angeles in the year as members of the lapds repdetect unit better known as blade runners we spoke with lead designer and free league cofounder tomas hrenstam to learn morea lot of the surface gameplay is investigation said hrenstam players will be going to places talking to people collecting evidence a big source of inspiration was sherlock holmes consulting detective and other classic mysterysolving gamesof course every good blade runner story needs its protagonists to grapple with existential questions between casesits a point that the source material makes said hrenstam that your humanity isnt decided by whether youre human or replicant its not defined by your origin its in your actions and what you choose to do and thats really the path that weve followed in designing the game that path is clear in the process of character creation which asks players to generate a key memory and define a key relationship both of which shape how their character engages with the world finding ways to interact grapple with these key elements during sessions will allow players to earn humanity points which can be spent to gain skill levelsbetween morally ambiguous casework players will spend a lot of their ingame time performing down time activities these narrative interludes will allow characters to go their separate ways and explore their lives outside of the lapd it gives us a spotlight into the personal lives of these characters hrenstam said down time is where mechanics like key memory and key relationship come into play and those function in the same way regardless of if youre a human or a replicantthe core rulebook contains over pages of worldbuilding immersive details and the official blade runner ruleset not to mention gorgeous art by martin grip fans will recognize his distinctive style from other free league projects including the one ring roleplaying the world of the lord of the ringsfans of alien the roleplaying game tales from the loop and forbidden lands will recognize the games year zero engine which appears in a new and developed form tailored to the neonnoir setting the original year zero engine involves a pool of sixsided dice for each roll with a six on one or more dice indicating a success more sixes mean a higher success and the dice pool increases as player skill and attribute levels increasein blade runner the mechanic has been streamlined players are equipped with just two dice one each for the base attribute and skill associated with the roll increases in player competence are reflected in the kind of dice used ranging from to hrenstam says this was to keep the game rules lightwe didnt want the rules and the dice to dominate the table too much he said so we decided to scale down the feel of the dice and the mechanics so that theyre a little more in the background than in some other year zero gamesalso included in the kickstarter materials is the first cinematic module for blade runner an adventure titled electric dreams game runners are given everything they need to create their own case file in the core rulebook but electric dreams serves as the perfect introductory module to help players and game runners settle into the worldwe didnt want to railroad players said hrenstam thats why players can interact with the materials presented to them in electric dreams and other case files in any way theyd like every case file is an interconnected web of clues locations npcs evidence but players will

your favorite show is falling down the list this list is in newest first order so new additions will be added to the top as they make the cutviewers who tune into david jenkins pirate comedy our flag means death because theyve heard so much about thor ragnarok and hunt for the wilderpeople director taika waititi in the show or about its tender bromanceturnedromance may be surprised to learn that neither of those elements really kicks in until episode of a run jenkins explained to polygon why that had to happen to make the story work but the result is that viewers who want the series full emotional impact have to stick with it through some light early comedy that recalls the early episodes of what we do in the shadowsthat comedy has its own charms and sets a lot of important gears in motion but it also only teases at our flags full powerful impact as waititi and his longtime partnerinmovies rhys darby playing comic versions of reallife pirates blackbeard and stede bonnet both endure personal identity crises and find the answers in each other our flag never stops being tongueincheek for long and the parade of comedy ringers pulling cameos including leslie jones fred armisen will arnett nick kroll and kristen schaal keeps the action lively but by the end of the first season its also a sweet smart invitation for viewers to run off and become pirates themselves or at least

deeds and more importantly their strength enter bojji a tiny warmhearted boy who is next in line to take on the throne from his ailing father who is king bojji isnt physically strong and struggles to speak thus leading him to communicate primarily through sign language however where his characteristics might lack in comparison to other more traditional leaders he makes up for in heart in the first episode he literally takes the shirt off his back for someone in needbojji is one of the most moving and compelling anime protagonists ive seen on screen ever ranking of kings charges even the most banal of moments with the highest stakes it makes a nonlethal spar between bojji and his halfbrother somehow feel more important than a fight between gods he makes for the perfect protagonist as his tiny stature and sense of awe make a sweeping fantasy land populated with golems wizards and giants feel all the more grand that being said bojji is far from being the only character who stands out alongside him is his companion kage who is the sole survivor of a oncepersecuted clan as well as his halfbrother daida who struggles to find a way to power that feels true to himranking of kings works because i would die for bojji however this series is more than an underdog story based on the manga written and illustrated by sosuke toka the anime nails all the fixings of a great fantasy series intriguing creatures mystical and dark magic palace intrigue and an adventure that takes the little lad to the depths of hell its an incredible series so far and one that i cant recommend enough ana

that formula and breathe new life into it it just makes sense that a school would be the subject of a documentarythe best part of abbott elementary is that each of the teachers just feels real like a

from eager and sometimes nave janine quinta brunson also series creator to street smart philadelphia native melissa lisa ann walter all the characters are vivid messy and relatable in their own ways and they all learn from each other so no one person is the butt of all the jokes and instead they have their own separate strengths and weaknesses and separate quirks about them that make them

put it in her lookback at the seasonstation eleven is that rare piece of pandemic media that dwells less on the heroism of a solution or the thrill of a core cause and more on the idea of the persistence of community and the creation of art even as the show forges numerous circuitous connections between its characters much of its plot is left openended the shows vignettes work out more

evidence a big source of inspiration was sherlock holmes consulting detective and other classic mysterysolving gamesof course every good blade runner story needs its protagonists to grapple with existential questions between casesits a point that the source material makes said hrenstam that your humanity isnt decided by whether youre human or replicant its not defined by your origin its in your actions and what you choose to do and thats really the path that weve followed in designing the game that path is clear in the process of character creation which asks players to generate a key memory and define a key relationship both of which shape how their character engages with the world finding ways to interact grapple with these key elements during sessions will allow players to earn humanity points which can be spent to gain skill levelsbetween morally ambiguous casework players will spend a lot of their ingame time performing down time activities these narrative interludes will allow characters to go their separate ways and explore their lives outside of the lapd it gives us a spotlight into the personal lives of these characters hrenstam said down time is where mechanics like key memory and key relationship come into play and those function in the same way regardless of if youre a human or a replicantthe core rulebook contains over pages of worldbuilding immersive details and the official blade runner ruleset not to mention gorgeous art by martin grip fans will recognize his distinctive style from other free league projects including the one ring roleplaying

tailored to the neonnoir setting the original year zero engine involves a pool of sixsided dice for each roll with a six on one or more dice indicating a success more sixes mean a higher success and the dice pool increases as player skill and attribute levels increasein blade runner the mechanic has been streamlined players are equipped with just two dice one each for the base attribute and skill associated with the roll increases in player competence are reflected in the kind of dice used ranging from to hrenstam says this was to keep the game rules lightwe didnt want the rules and the dice to dominate the table too much he said so we decided to scale down the feel of the dice and the mechanics so that theyre a little more in the background than in some other year zero gamesalso included in the kickstarter materials is the first cinematic module for blade runner an adventure titled electric dreams game runners are given everything they need to create their own case file in the core rulebook but electric dreams serves as the perfect introductory module to help players and game runners settle into the worldwe didnt want to railroad players said hrenstam thats why players can interact with the materials presented to them in electric dreams and other case files in any way theyd like every case file is an interconnected web of clues locations npcs evidence but players will

organizing under the united food and commercial workers canada union local no to be their collective bargaining agent tuesday may is the deadline for their employer to file any objections to the unions formation assuming there are none a vote should be scheduled within two weeks and if of the keywords testers vote yes they will begin bargaining a contractkeywords would be the second video games developer in north america to have workers organized into a collective bargaining unit twentyone raven software qa workers located in wisconsin began voting on friday on whether to form a union called game workers alliance those votes will be counted may studios founded in is headquartered in ireland and maintains more than offices worldwide keywords studios in edmonton is managed by the companys british columbia office keywords provides technical services in art audio games development localization and quality assurance but does not develop or publish games itself bioware owned by electronic arts since is among several aaa studios and publishers in the companys clienteleone of keywords organizers who asked not to be identified as our management doesnt know whos involved with the effort at this point said that their vote could involve between and employees pending a labour board review of eligible positions regardless this organizer is heavily confident that we will achieve a union we should be easily able to overcome this vote thresholdthe organizer said that the raven workers actions well publicized in the games press were somewhat an inspiration mainly in showing them that it was possible to take action the actual reason for starting a union they said stemmed from unhappiness with low wages and then a returntowork policy that will add significant monthly parking fees and other commuting costs to a job still paying them the same wage that it was just a few weeks agoour entry level testers start at minimum wage which in alberta is an hour a onebedroom apartment is about here in edmonton paid twice monthly the organizer reckoned that many of their colleagues take home between and each paycheckmeanwhile according to organizers workers in other departments have been granted more flexibilitywhile our studio counterparts over at bioware theyre getting a little more of a hybrid model flex hours or permanent workfromhome options it wasnt really being afforded to us the organizer said so some of our members felt that maybe we can have a little more of a conversation about thispublic parking which workers are expected to cover themselves runs between and a month they said thats before youre buying yourself groceries and all the other expenses they said workers had avoided this and other commuting costs by working from home since the pandemic emptied out offices in the spring of organizer said they have worked for keywords for two years and gotten a raise to an hour but they like most of the workers who would vote on a union started their testing job during the pandemic and have not gone into biowares office to work alongside its developers over the past two years keywords qa in edmonton assisted on mass effect legendary edition which launched last may as well as the legacy of the sith expansion that launched for star wars the old republic this february currently keywords qa workers are working on the next dragon age the organizer saidmany of our individuals have things like student loans they said just like down in the united states postsecondary education is not free up here either they said most of their colleagues had fouryear university degrees and those that didnt likely had studied at a technical college the university of alberta a well regarded public university there in edmonton is often a feeder to the local tech industry games development includedit really resonated with a lot of our members that we are viewed as unskilled labor minimum wage you get to sit around and play video games all day right the organizer said but i think the reality that most people dont understand is how highly technical the qa industry is and a lot of these individuals who are working on our team these are people who are coming out of university with computer science degrees and just trying to get started in the industrytheyre highly talented individuals that are creating immense wealth for their

polygon,2022/05/04,https://www.polygon.com/23013686/playdate-panic-crank-history#comments,The 8-year process behind Playdate’s glorious crank,since the introduction of portable gaming each new handheld has been designed to stand out from the crowd which has often meant more power but also unique features that some might consider gimmicks the microvision introduced swappable cartridges the game watch kept track of time the game gear featured color visuals and drained six aa batteries in a matter of hours and while impressive new features havent always resulted in outstanding sales the world of handheld gaming has continued to leap forward with selling points like touch panels microphones and stereoscopic effects prior to a few years ago little did players know one of the strangest was yet to cometoday nintendo almost singlehandedly controls the dedicated gaming handheld market while phones and tablets fill the void for the average consumer enter playdate panics adorable yellow gaming device originally announced in early has its feet planted firmly in both the past and the future though it has the appearance of a boxy game boy pocket the quirky handheld is designed to receive digital games weekly via wifi with a retro aesthetic and modern innards playdate represents an artistic twist on both old and newand yet the aspect that seems to have piqued the interest of most fans and developers is the small crank protruding from playdates right side with a silver arm and yellow handle playdates crank looks like a tiny hand waving hello to apprehensive players playdate represents a wide array of novel ideas but none as bizarre and enticing as the crank thus we have committed ourselves to understanding the crank becoming one with it who thought it up how has it been tested how are developers using it in their games all will be answered all will be crankedto understand where the crank came from one first needs a crash course on how playdate itself came to be it all began years ago when panic cofounder cabel sasser reached out to designer jesper kouthoofd of teenage engineering a fan of teenage engineerings stylish synthesizers sasser wanted to know if the small stockholmbased electronics design team would be interested in teaming up for panics upcoming anniversary the plan was to manufacture something incredibly special for panics most loyal customers the connection was successful but the product in question was still up for debatesitting quietly in the back of sassers mind for the next few years the anniversary item was never a focus for the small team at panic it wasnt until sasser discovered the existence of a superreflective blackandwhite lcd screen that he had an epiphany why not make a handheld console this was a big leap for panic a company known in tech circles for its intuitive file transfer and web development software but sasser and his team began to draw up plans for a simple prototype that could play games with preset visuals and limited movement la the game watch but it needed a spark something special sasser says thats when we reached back out to teenage engineeringby this point panics anniversary was in the rearview mirror so sasser decided this new mystery project would have to coincide with the when kouthoofd heard of the idea for the product he was more than happy to offer teenage engineerings expertise agreeing to meet with the panic team at the biannual moogfest a music and technology festival then held in asheville north carolina the two teams one known for software and the other for hardware sat down to bounce ideas off one another and hash out a rudimentary plan it was this meeting that officially transformed the handheld project from a theoretical anniversary gift to a potential commercial productsettling on the codename asheville a nod to their initial meeting spot the two teams retreated back to their respective sides of the globe to ponder ways to make the handheld a realitya mere week after the facetoface meet up on sunday may sasser found an email sitting in his inbox from kouthoofd it was labeled first ideas and read as follows typos verbatimgoals the design should make mass production easy avoid metal to improve bluetooth signal mould the case in one color with the addition of grey for graphics and details add as much of the graphics to the mould to reduce print costs as the display is a major part of the device try to match design elements so they are in harmony with the display and the graphics shown on it perhaps using pixel icons on keys make the device feel like some kind of cartridge technical but still fun and happy avoid making the device too gamey would be great to define a new category i love the season thinking a digital experience art object magic entertainment device simple and striking design that once you have seen it you will always remember it like a floppy disk you can draw it from memory add at least one creative input methods crank scroll wheel slider hidden switch etc figure out some kind of stand or hanger for clock modeoverall create a design and a device that is not obvious a game device but something more something newdont worry about being frank if you dont like it if you have other ideas you want to try just send me references or sketchesjesperthe email came with a picture attachedsasser was blown away after forwarding the email to the rest of the panic team he shot off a quick response now adamant the handheld had to be madei have notes and thoughts of course but this is immediately excitingand the crank the crank my godcabelsince asheville kouthoofd had been thinking long and hard about what a gaming handheld should and shouldnt be he was determined to steer panic in the right direction the direction teenage engineering had been sailing for yearseverything we do is to create kind of an alternative to touchscreen psychosis kouthoofd said years later on an episode of the panic podcast its very effective for like a smartphone but for a gaming device a gaming device to me is almost the same as a musical instrument its about zero latency muscle memory and you need to feel that you are in instant control of everything that happens that tactility however you solve it if its pressing a button or turning a knob or a crank its very important for the whole experience and the joy of being in control and using your handseach of the control dynamics proposed by kouthoofd and his team had potential thought sasser but the one that especially struck the panic team was the small removable crank that could attach to the side of the handheld allowing for radial input an outrageous concept for any gaming device that wasnt a fishing controllerthe crank was obviously the real no pun intended turning point in terms of maybe this thing can follow its own path sasser tells polygon but we did experiment for a while the crank idea was that you could plug different things into it maybe a hex shaped port that the crank magnetically snaps into and you can plug something else in like a dial i love exploring stuff like that and i have a very patient team that also loves exploring stuff like that but very quickly we got the sense a gut feeling that maybe it was too much we already felt like we were pushing the limits not only trying to do this season delivery thing which is pretty unusual but also having the black and white screen and the crank at some point this system is just going to be too much its going to be like homers car in the simpsonsand so as other details like the handhelds name and wireless game delivery service were hammered out a single nonremovable crank was settled on now panic and friends just had to engineer the design test it thoroughly tie it into the operating software and convince game developers to jump on boardafter much discussion and debate the powers that be at panic and teenage engineering discovered that playdate in its final form would need to be made entirely of custom parts every tiny pozidriv screw and springy button cover would need to be crafted from scratch and assembled by hand in a malaysian factory and all the parts would need to fit neatly within playdates minuscule mm casingaccording to panics mechanical engineering and manufacturing consultant steven nersesian the crank introduced a handful of production and engineering issues in an email nersesian broke down these issues into five distinct sectionssurface finish getting the surface finish on the axle was critical inclusive of the diameter and tolerance and the roundness this was paramount to getting the proper feel of the rotation not too loose not too tightbearing there is an internal plastic bearing that the crank assembly presses into similar to the axle challenges we had to watch the roundness of the bearing as injection molded parts tend to shrink at different rates in alternate axes and the material choice was critical requiring multiple iterations to test until we got it just righthandle design to get the color match to the housing color we had to make the handle out of plastic but that doesnt make for a good bearing surface against the metal arm nor give the handle a long life for those doing lots of cranking teenage engineerings small design in addition to the overall thinness of playdate meant there was very little room inside to fit all of the details initial iterations cracked and had a dissatisfying feel ultimately we prototyped a few options and settled on the one that was most manufacturable most reliable and had the best feelingflipout feeling there is an internal ball bearing and spring mechanism that gives a satisfying feeling when you pull it out of the pocket tuning those parts and the matching geometry in the axle proved difficultrepeatability making the assembly the same every time had some hurdles different assembly line workers approached it differently which resulted in small variations we had to work with the production team the engineering team and an assembly jig manufacturer to come up with a nifty jig that unified the process so that every crank assembly was made the same way we also have a checker to make sure they meet the specs and are within tolerancewhile the factory production of the crank fell into place panic ran headlong into a new problem the factory had machines that could perform repetitive tasks like pressing buttons ad nauseam and peppering playdate with controlled electric surges but there was no such device for testing a crankthe force is so tiny that we couldnt find any equipment accurate enough at an affordable price we would have had to spend on an automated test machine sasser says so instead we relied on literal years of shipping hundreds of units to early developers and gathering feedback through their realworld usethe panic team also had thousands of attendees put the crank to the test at its pax west booth in the team even printed out a stack of special cards with the words oh thanks for breaking that to hand out to any unwitting tester who managed to crank things too far much to everyones surprise the cards sat untouched for the entire fourday conventionairing the feels postconf i worked the booth at pax west this weekend and absolutely everyone i met was super nice and enthusiasticthank you for stopping by to play and chat their pax experiment a resounding success and after years of engineering troubleshooting and testing the crank was officially ready for the public the stainless steel axle and arm magnet plastic handle pin and screw would end up costing panic per unitwhile the physical aspects of the crank were being perfected panic was busy building a simple operating system and wooing game creators with playdates distinctive specs though the crank was one of the handhelds standout features panic designers made sure it wasnt too heavily featured in the overall feel of the operating system by stacking game choices and system settings panic gave owners the chance to casually scroll through their options by turning the crank forwards and backwards simple movements that felt naturalgame developers were split when it came to the crank though there were a fair share of crank enthusiasts sasser estimates that roughly half of the developers who showed interest in working on a playdate title didnt feel the need to utilize the crank in any way they were more excited about the onebit screen or retro feel when thinking back on the development of the games in playdates introductory season sasser says hes glad each developer felt free to follow their heartsit seems many developers who witnessed the crank in action all jumped to the same conclusion fishing almost every developer we showed playdate to immediately mentioned a fishing game sasser recalls and yet because of this everybody thought everybody else was making a fishing game as a result we have no fishing games yetand while a handful of developers had access to playdate early on most discovered the handheld alongside the general public in may of fortunately there was still ample time to jump aboard the playdate train for season onein the summer of as vitei ceo giles goddard perused the selection of indie games at kyotos yearly bitsummit festival he couldnt help but notice a small crowd of onlookers gathered feverishly around a single man the man was writer designer consultant and panic pal nick suttner and those gawking over his shoulder were all hoping to get their hands on the curious handheld he was so casually flauntingonce goddard got a moment or two with the miniature yellow device he quickly fell in love i had no idea what the crank was all about goddard says i thought maybe it had to do with charging or it was just something you fiddle with i didnt think it was an actual input then i picked it up actually felt it and played around with it and everything was just so tactile using the crank is such a nice direct input i was just enamored by it from day onegoddard has been a part of the gaming industry longer than most joining upandcoming development studio argonaut games as a programmer in the late goddard relocated to japan to help with production of the original star fox at the tender age of goddard soon joined nintendo ead as its first western employee programming the iconic interactive mario face at the start of super mario and landing the title of lead programmer on the critically acclaimed snowboardingeventually stepping out on his own goddard began working freelance gigs many for nintendo and decided to start his own development studio vitei inc since its inception in vitei has helped with various titles and developed many of their own even spawning a spinoff studio in kyoto called vitei backroom now chuhai labsafter his first interaction with playdate goddard knew he wanted to develop a game around the handhelds miraculous crank eventually securing a few prototype units goddard devised a friendly playdate pitch jam for the team at chuhai labs twenty unique games were pitched but in the end it was goddards vision of a simple surfing game that received the most votesgoddards game dubbed whitewater wipeout was inspired by the tight controls of playdates crank and the standout mobile game of his childhood california games my brother had an atari lynx which was way ahead of its time goddard says the best game on the lynx was california games and the best game in california games was surfing because it was such a tight wellmade minigame we were just hooked on itthinking back to his time with california games on the lynx goddard felt the biggest issue was always the lack of precise control when rotating ones surfboard at some point i just thought the crank is the perfect way to control this goddard says because you have degrees of whatever rotation you want at any time you decide the speed by how fast youre turning it the fact that you can spin it really quickly and then slow down to get really fine movements is so unique theres literally no other control input that lets you do that as soon as i realized a surfing game would match it perfectly that was the point i thought it has to be thatonce the basic concept of whitewater had been fleshed out goddard and his team set forth to program the game using panics code editor nova as someone who had worked on games for complex and powerful consoles in the past goddard was struck by how much he enjoyed the simplicity of developing a game for playdate the scope was limited but it forced him to focus on making the gameplay and the crank controls as precise as possiblegoddard explains that programming the crank was as simple as assigning a range of numbers from zero to depending on the numerical input the surfboard on screen would be rotated to a different angle panic has given playdate the ability to run like an emulator on any computer allowing developers and average players to use an attached console as a controller of sorts for testing purposes goddard could use his mouse to manipulate a digital circle representing the crank or he could pick up the real thing and put in a few rotationsthe entire device is very simple to program with its greatas goddard sat cranking newer and newer playdate prototypes to test his game a small problem presented itself one that panic was well aware of not every crank is created equal some prototype cranks were loose and easy to turn while others were stiff and needed more effort one of the difficult things was figuring out if the final version of the crank was going to be a floppy crank or a stiff crank says goddard i know it sounds like a really stupid little issue but it was quite interestingthe team at chuhai labs went so far as to take a few prototype units apart and oil the crank seeing how much tensile attention was needed to make whitewater handle just so i had a little technique where i would grease it just enough for it to feel really good i dont know if youre supposed to do that but we did goddard laughs in the end both the panic and chuhai labs teams seem happy with the current state of the crank a nice middle ground that allows for both speed and accuracywhen asked how playdate compares to past gaming devices in terms of control goddard is quick to defend the crank embracing it as both an essential aspect of the system and a gimmick of sorts most gimmicks feel like gimmicks goddard says take the on the most of the time id say most people turn it off because its distracting not to mention it takes battery power and can slow things down the is great as a gimmick as a way to show off a game but when you want to play it fulltime you probably turn it off because you dont need it goddard insists the crank does not fall into this category while the crank is a gimmick of sorts its also highly effective at what it does and seemingly necessary to the success of most playdate gamesthe team at chuhai labs is already brainstorming its next playdate outing and giles goddard says hes excited to be involved its kind of my dream job to make games for this thing the programmer says holding up a playdate we have playstation dev kits oculus dev kits and all these other dev kits and by far the most fun is this onedespite delays due to faulty batteries cpu shortages and factory closures panics handheld is finally on its way to the first wave of consumers as playdate systems slowly make their way into the wild the success of the crank and the handheld as a whole will soon become apparent games like whitewater wipeout and keita takahashis crankins time travel adventure with core gameplay developed around the crank will be put to the test by thousands of new usersfor many the magic of the crank may not lie in the games that feature it heavily but rather the ones that manage to merge its functionality into the tried and true mechanics of classic genres or hide it in subtle onscreen gestures indie developer lucas pope known for cult hits like papers please and return of the obra dinn has already showcased the latter with a quick peek at his game mars after midnight during panics playdate update this past summermars after midnight puts players behind the door of an off colony community support center for a wide variety of martian weirdos when creatures come aknocking players use the playdate crank to open the hinged flap on the doors window this light touch a motion that only takes the crank half way around its axis is insignificant but natural its exactly the kind of small detail that will make the playdate stand out from other handhelds and gaming consolesa lot of the excitement surrounding the playdate is generated from the fact that players dont know exactly whats coming each week outside of game titles and a few select clips of gameplay we dont know how or even if the crank will work within most games half the fun will be experiencing how and where the crank pops up not to mention the outrageous radial control schemes that the community of hobbyist developers will no doubt churn out in the coming yearsis playdates crank a revolutionary new form of gaming input or a silly dash of superfluous nonsense one could argue its a bit of both but whether you feel the crank is genius or trivial youll be hard pressed to refrain from giving it a few turns should you ever get your hands on the cheery yellow handheld and after all the thought and love that was poured into the tiny mechanical appendage who could blame you,en,915,Positive

polygon,2022/05/04,https://www.polygon.com/23013686/playdate-panic-crank-history,The 8-year process behind Playdate’s glorious crank,since the introduction of portable gaming each new handheld has been designed to stand out from the crowd which has often meant more power but also unique features that some might consider gimmicks the microvision introduced swappable cartridges the game watch kept track of time the game gear featured color visuals and drained six aa batteries in a matter of hours and while impressive new features havent always resulted in outstanding sales the world of handheld gaming has continued to leap forward with selling points like touch panels microphones and stereoscopic effects prior to a few years ago little did players know one of the strangest was yet to cometoday nintendo almost singlehandedly controls the dedicated gaming handheld market while phones and tablets fill the void for the average consumer enter playdate panics adorable yellow gaming device originally announced in early has its feet planted firmly in both the past and the future though it has the appearance of a boxy game boy pocket the quirky handheld is designed to receive digital games weekly via wifi with a retro aesthetic and modern innards playdate represents an artistic twist on both old and newand yet the aspect that seems to have piqued the interest of most fans and developers is the small crank protruding from playdates right side with a silver arm and yellow handle playdates crank looks like a tiny hand waving hello to apprehensive players playdate represents a wide array of novel ideas but none as bizarre and enticing as the crank thus we have committed ourselves to understanding the crank becoming one with it who thought it up how has it been tested how are developers using it in their games all will be answered all will be crankedto understand where the crank came from one first needs a crash course on how playdate itself came to be it all began years ago when panic cofounder cabel sasser reached out to designer jesper kouthoofd of teenage engineering a fan of teenage engineerings stylish synthesizers sasser wanted to know if the small stockholmbased electronics design team would be interested in teaming up for panics upcoming anniversary the plan was to manufacture something incredibly special for panics most loyal customers the connection was successful but the product in question was still up for debatesitting quietly in the back of sassers mind for the next few years the anniversary item was never a focus for the small team at panic it wasnt until sasser discovered the existence of a superreflective blackandwhite lcd screen that he had an epiphany why not make a handheld console this was a big leap for panic a company known in tech circles for its intuitive file transfer and web development software but sasser and his team began to draw up plans for a simple prototype that could play games with preset visuals and limited movement la the game watch but it needed a spark something special sasser says thats when we reached back out to teenage engineeringby this point panics anniversary was in the rearview mirror so sasser decided this new mystery project would have to coincide with the when kouthoofd heard of the idea for the product he was more than happy to offer teenage engineerings expertise agreeing to meet with the panic team at the biannual moogfest a music and technology festival then held in asheville north carolina the two teams one known for software and the other for hardware sat down to bounce ideas off one another and hash out a rudimentary plan it was this meeting that officially transformed the handheld project from a theoretical anniversary gift to a potential commercial productsettling on the codename asheville a nod to their initial meeting spot the two teams retreated back to their respective sides of the globe to ponder ways to make the handheld a realitya mere week after the facetoface meet up on sunday may sasser found an email sitting in his inbox from kouthoofd it was labeled first ideas and read as follows typos verbatimgoals the design should make mass production easy avoid metal to improve bluetooth signal mould the case in one color with the addition of grey for graphics and details add as much of the graphics to the mould to reduce print costs as the display is a major part of the device try to match design elements so they are in harmony with the display and the graphics shown on it perhaps using pixel icons on keys make the device feel like some kind of cartridge technical but still fun and happy avoid making the device too gamey would be great to define a new category i love the season thinking a digital experience art object magic entertainment device simple and striking design that once you have seen it you will always remember it like a floppy disk you can draw it from memory add at least one creative input methods crank scroll wheel slider hidden switch etc figure out some kind of stand or hanger for clock modeoverall create a design and a device that is not obvious a game device but something more something newdont worry about being frank if you dont like it if you have other ideas you want to try just send me references or sketchesjesperthe email came with a picture attachedsasser was blown away after forwarding the email to the rest of the panic team he shot off a quick response now adamant the handheld had to be madei have notes and thoughts of course but this is immediately excitingand the crank the crank my godcabelsince asheville kouthoofd had been thinking long and hard about what a gaming handheld should and shouldnt be he was determined to steer panic in the right direction the direction teenage engineering had been sailing for yearseverything we do is to create kind of an alternative to touchscreen psychosis kouthoofd said years later on an episode of the panic podcast its very effective for like a smartphone but for a gaming device a gaming device to me is almost the same as a musical instrument its about zero latency muscle memory and you need to feel that you are in instant control of everything that happens that tactility however you solve it if its pressing a button or turning a knob or a crank its very important for the whole experience and the joy of being in control and using your handseach of the control dynamics proposed by kouthoofd and his team had potential thought sasser but the one that especially struck the panic team was the small removable crank that could attach to the side of the handheld allowing for radial input an outrageous concept for any gaming device that wasnt a fishing controllerthe crank was obviously the real no pun intended turning point in terms of maybe this thing can follow its own path sasser tells polygon but we did experiment for a while the crank idea was that you could plug different things into it maybe a hex shaped port that the crank magnetically snaps into and you can plug something else in like a dial i love exploring stuff like that and i have a very patient team that also loves exploring stuff like that but very quickly we got the sense a gut feeling that maybe it was too much we already felt like we were pushing the limits not only trying to do this season delivery thing which is pretty unusual but also having the black and white screen and the crank at some point this system is just going to be too much its going to be like homers car in the simpsonsand so as other details like the handhelds name and wireless game delivery service were hammered out a single nonremovable crank was settled on now panic and friends just had to engineer the design test it thoroughly tie it into the operating software and convince game developers to jump on boardafter much discussion and debate the powers that be at panic and teenage engineering discovered that playdate in its final form would need to be made entirely of custom parts every tiny pozidriv screw and springy button cover would need to be crafted from scratch and assembled by hand in a malaysian factory and all the parts would need to fit neatly within playdates minuscule mm casingaccording to panics mechanical engineering and manufacturing consultant steven nersesian the crank introduced a handful of production and engineering issues in an email nersesian broke down these issues into five distinct sectionssurface finish getting the surface finish on the axle was critical inclusive of the diameter and tolerance and the roundness this was paramount to getting the proper feel of the rotation not too loose not too tightbearing there is an internal plastic bearing that the crank assembly presses into similar to the axle challenges we had to watch the roundness of the bearing as injection molded parts tend to shrink at different rates in alternate axes and the material choice was critical requiring multiple iterations to test until we got it just righthandle design to get the color match to the housing color we had to make the handle out of plastic but that doesnt make for a good bearing surface against the metal arm nor give the handle a long life for those doing lots of cranking teenage engineerings small design in addition to the overall thinness of playdate meant there was very little room inside to fit all of the details initial iterations cracked and had a dissatisfying feel ultimately we prototyped a few options and settled on the one that was most manufacturable most reliable and had the best feelingflipout feeling there is an internal ball bearing and spring mechanism that gives a satisfying feeling when you pull it out of the pocket tuning those parts and the matching geometry in the axle proved difficultrepeatability making the assembly the same every time had some hurdles different assembly line workers approached it differently which resulted in small variations we had to work with the production team the engineering team and an assembly jig manufacturer to come up with a nifty jig that unified the process so that every crank assembly was made the same way we also have a checker to make sure they meet the specs and are within tolerancewhile the factory production of the crank fell into place panic ran headlong into a new problem the factory had machines that could perform repetitive tasks like pressing buttons ad nauseam and peppering playdate with controlled electric surges but there was no such device for testing a crankthe force is so tiny that we couldnt find any equipment accurate enough at an affordable price we would have had to spend on an automated test machine sasser says so instead we relied on literal years of shipping hundreds of units to early developers and gathering feedback through their realworld usethe panic team also had thousands of attendees put the crank to the test at its pax west booth in the team even printed out a stack of special cards with the words oh thanks for breaking that to hand out to any unwitting tester who managed to crank things too far much to everyones surprise the cards sat untouched for the entire fourday conventionairing the feels postconf i worked the booth at pax west this weekend and absolutely everyone i met was super nice and enthusiasticthank you for stopping by to play and chat their pax experiment a resounding success and after years of engineering troubleshooting and testing the crank was officially ready for the public the stainless steel axle and arm magnet plastic handle pin and screw would end up costing panic per unitwhile the physical aspects of the crank were being perfected panic was busy building a simple operating system and wooing game creators with playdates distinctive specs though the crank was one of the handhelds standout features panic designers made sure it wasnt too heavily featured in the overall feel of the operating system by stacking game choices and system settings panic gave owners the chance to casually scroll through their options by turning the crank forwards and backwards simple movements that felt naturalgame developers were split when it came to the crank though there were a fair share of crank enthusiasts sasser estimates that roughly half of the developers who showed interest in working on a playdate title didnt feel the need to utilize the crank in any way they were more excited about the onebit screen or retro feel when thinking back on the development of the games in playdates introductory season sasser says hes glad each developer felt free to follow their heartsit seems many developers who witnessed the crank in action all jumped to the same conclusion fishing almost every developer we showed playdate to immediately mentioned a fishing game sasser recalls and yet because of this everybody thought everybody else was making a fishing game as a result we have no fishing games yetand while a handful of developers had access to playdate early on most discovered the handheld alongside the general public in may of fortunately there was still ample time to jump aboard the playdate train for season onein the summer of as vitei ceo giles goddard perused the selection of indie games at kyotos yearly bitsummit festival he couldnt help but notice a small crowd of onlookers gathered feverishly around a single man the man was writer designer consultant and panic pal nick suttner and those gawking over his shoulder were all hoping to get their hands on the curious handheld he was so casually flauntingonce goddard got a moment or two with the miniature yellow device he quickly fell in love i had no idea what the crank was all about goddard says i thought maybe it had to do with charging or it was just something you fiddle with i didnt think it was an actual input then i picked it up actually felt it and played around with it and everything was just so tactile using the crank is such a nice direct input i was just enamored by it from day onegoddard has been a part of the gaming industry longer than most joining upandcoming development studio argonaut games as a programmer in the late goddard relocated to japan to help with production of the original star fox at the tender age of goddard soon joined nintendo ead as its first western employee programming the iconic interactive mario face at the start of super mario and landing the title of lead programmer on the critically acclaimed snowboardingeventually stepping out on his own goddard began working freelance gigs many for nintendo and decided to start his own development studio vitei inc since its inception in vitei has helped with various titles and developed many of their own even spawning a spinoff studio in kyoto called vitei backroom now chuhai labsafter his first interaction with playdate goddard knew he wanted to develop a game around the handhelds miraculous crank eventually securing a few prototype units goddard devised a friendly playdate pitch jam for the team at chuhai labs twenty unique games were pitched but in the end it was goddards vision of a simple surfing game that received the most votesgoddards game dubbed whitewater wipeout was inspired by the tight controls of playdates crank and the standout mobile game of his childhood california games my brother had an atari lynx which was way ahead of its time goddard says the best game on the lynx was california games and the best game in california games was surfing because it was such a tight wellmade minigame we were just hooked on itthinking back to his time with california games on the lynx goddard felt the biggest issue was always the lack of precise control when rotating ones surfboard at some point i just thought the crank is the perfect way to control this goddard says because you have degrees of whatever rotation you want at any time you decide the speed by how fast youre turning it the fact that you can spin it really quickly and then slow down to get really fine movements is so unique theres literally no other control input that lets you do that as soon as i realized a surfing game would match it perfectly that was the point i thought it has to be thatonce the basic concept of whitewater had been fleshed out goddard and his team set forth to program the game using panics code editor nova as someone who had worked on games for complex and powerful consoles in the past goddard was struck by how much he enjoyed the simplicity of developing a game for playdate the scope was limited but it forced him to focus on making the gameplay and the crank controls as precise as possiblegoddard explains that programming the crank was as simple as assigning a range of numbers from zero to depending on the numerical input the surfboard on screen would be rotated to a different angle panic has given playdate the ability to run like an emulator on any computer allowing developers and average players to use an attached console as a controller of sorts for testing purposes goddard could use his mouse to manipulate a digital circle representing the crank or he could pick up the real thing and put in a few rotationsthe entire device is very simple to program with its greatas goddard sat cranking newer and newer playdate prototypes to test his game a small problem presented itself one that panic was well aware of not every crank is created equal some prototype cranks were loose and easy to turn while others were stiff and needed more effort one of the difficult things was figuring out if the final version of the crank was going to be a floppy crank or a stiff crank says goddard i know it sounds like a really stupid little issue but it was quite interestingthe team at chuhai labs went so far as to take a few prototype units apart and oil the crank seeing how much tensile attention was needed to make whitewater handle just so i had a little technique where i would grease it just enough for it to feel really good i dont know if youre supposed to do that but we did goddard laughs in the end both the panic and chuhai labs teams seem happy with the current state of the crank a nice middle ground that allows for both speed and accuracywhen asked how playdate compares to past gaming devices in terms of control goddard is quick to defend the crank embracing it as both an essential aspect of the system and a gimmick of sorts most gimmicks feel like gimmicks goddard says take the on the most of the time id say most people turn it off because its distracting not to mention it takes battery power and can slow things down the is great as a gimmick as a way to show off a game but when you want to play it fulltime you probably turn it off because you dont need it goddard insists the crank does not fall into this category while the crank is a gimmick of sorts its also highly effective at what it does and seemingly necessary to the success of most playdate gamesthe team at chuhai labs is already brainstorming its next playdate outing and giles goddard says hes excited to be involved its kind of my dream job to make games for this thing the programmer says holding up a playdate we have playstation dev kits oculus dev kits and all these other dev kits and by far the most fun is this onedespite delays due to faulty batteries cpu shortages and factory closures panics handheld is finally on its way to the first wave of consumers as playdate systems slowly make their way into the wild the success of the crank and the handheld as a whole will soon become apparent games like whitewater wipeout and keita takahashis crankins time travel adventure with core gameplay developed around the crank will be put to the test by thousands of new usersfor many the magic of the crank may not lie in the games that feature it heavily but rather the ones that manage to merge its functionality into the tried and true mechanics of classic genres or hide it in subtle onscreen gestures indie developer lucas pope known for cult hits like papers please and return of the obra dinn has already showcased the latter with a quick peek at his game mars after midnight during panics playdate update this past summermars after midnight puts players behind the door of an off colony community support center for a wide variety of martian weirdos when creatures come aknocking players use the playdate crank to open the hinged flap on the doors window this light touch a motion that only takes the crank half way around its axis is insignificant but natural its exactly the kind of small detail that will make the playdate stand out from other handhelds and gaming consolesa lot of the excitement surrounding the playdate is generated from the fact that players dont know exactly whats coming each week outside of game titles and a few select clips of gameplay we dont know how or even if the crank will work within most games half the fun will be experiencing how and where the crank pops up not to mention the outrageous radial control schemes that the community of hobbyist developers will no doubt churn out in the coming yearsis playdates crank a revolutionary new form of gaming input or a silly dash of superfluous nonsense one could argue its a bit of both but whether you feel the crank is genius or trivial youll be hard pressed to refrain from giving it a few turns should you ever get your hands on the cheery yellow handheld and after all the thought and love that was poured into the tiny mechanical appendage who could blame you,en,1686,Positive
