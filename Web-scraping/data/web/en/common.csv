one playstation playstation and windows based pcs the game is the latest annual entry in the games and world wrestling entertainment wwe franchise returning after skipping a year in for improvements the game features a roster made up of current and former wwe superstars that fight in a variety of choreographed combat matches violence is a focal point of the game with pain and injury shown on the fighters there also the option to add onscreen blood to the mix though the option is turned off in the settings by default wwe does includes mild profanity and suggestive comments in some of its dialogue while both male and female wrestlers are often shown in somewhat revealing outfits parents should also be aware that the game features options for online multiplayer and for sharing custom content creations both of which could expose younger players to potentially offensive content there also a significant push for microtransactions with some content locked behind downloadable content that can be earned by playing or purchased using real moneyafter a one year hiatus the superstars of the wwe ring return to ring in wwe the latest entry in games series based on the popular sports entertainment brand the game has been rebuilt from the ground up with new gameplay new graphics new game modes and a massive roster of past and present wwe athletes players can recreate their favorite battles in either solo or local and online multiplayer choosing superstars and competing in everything from standard oneonone and tag team matches to brutal steel cage or last man standing matches to epic battle royal bouts you can relive history as you revisit the long and storied journey of wwe legend ray mysterio jr replaying key moments and matches that shaped his career or you can use the game myrise mode to build your own legacy taking a custom built superstar through their own unique career path with all the trials and tribulations that come with seeking out championship gold or maybe you rather act more behind the scenes than in the spotlight wwe new mygm mode give you total control over one of the wwe flagship shows where you responsible for signing new talent planning events and setting the foundation for some great storylines do you have what it takes to keep the hype machine rolling and gain those allimportant ratings over the other three shows with all of these updates and changes wwe has set itself up for a comeback of grand proportionssometimes taking a break can make a world of difference take wwe after the previous game in the series received a lukewarm reception at best the publisher skipped a year and went back to the drawing board the result is a game that gives a sorely needed second wind to a series on the verge of tapping out new controls and gameplay makes the series more accessible to newcomers superstar moves chain together in a much more fluid way giving players a sense of real accomplishment after stringing together a stellar combination of attacks and on the defensive side the improved blockreversal mechanic combined with a new dodge command gives players a fighting chance to keep from getting mercilessly pummeled while it much easier to pick up and play veterans of the series will still enjoy the technical aspects of the game superstars move much more like their real world counterparts and movesets allow a diverse arsenal of attacks and a wide range of strategic options in matchesthough wwe is a massive leap forward for the franchise it not without its share of flaws some frustrating technical glitches still pop up from time to time though much less frequently than in the past plus there always the likelihood of these getting patched out later then there the roster of wwe superstars due to the unavoidable lag between development and release which coincided with massive talent releases at wwe a large number of current superstars available are no longer with the company in fact many have even debuted to much fanfare in other wrestling promotions the mygm mode seems like it was tacked on at the last minute while planning and running your own fantasy football take on the wwe flagship shows is something fans have been craving it just feels anemic and lacking any real depth the showcase mode also feels a bit bare with substantial and surprising gaps in the spotlight on the career of wwe legend ray mysterio jr thankfully the remaining modes more than make up for these weaknesses taking your custom created superstar on his or her journey in myrise is an absolute blast the new myfaction mode provides a constant stream of new challenges while also appealing to the collector mindset with its trading card element while far from perfect wwe still breathes new life into the franchise as both a resurrection from the ashes of the last game and as one of the best outings for the wwe series as a wholefamilies can talk about violence in entertainment is the impact of the violence in wwe affected by the fact that the action and drama of the wwe events shows and games are scripted do you think this has a greater impact on younger audiences what are the risks involved in imitating the moves of

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/bloons-td-6,Bloons TD 6+,parents need to know that bloons td is a downloadable strategy game exclusively for apple arcade this is the latest chapter in a longrunning app franchise although this version doesn have any ingame purchases the tower defense game puts players in control of a group of monkeys and their structures as they attempt to destroy balloons from invading their lands across a specific pathway there no inappropriate content within the game since you tossing darts or other weapons to make balloons pop the challenge with the game comes in learning the various abilities of each monkey and tower and placing them strategically to eliminate the kinds of balloons that descend in each round at faster speeds with varying properties to help them survive incoming attacksbloons td doesn really have a significant story to pay attention to unlike other apps the premise behind the game is that a collection of balloons or bloons as the game calls them have decided to travel along a twisty path through towns villages forests and other landscapes clearly taunting the monkeys that inhabit these locations taking up arms against their mortal enemies the monkeys decide to blast these threats out of the sky okay perhaps that a bit more melodramatic than it actually is but the concept is basically the same players will place monkeys each with their own skillsets and abilities such as ninja snipers or wizards in the balloon way to deflate the oncoming hordes of floating orbs each inflatable that you take down with earn you coins that you can use to upgrade their skills and firepower or purchase new units like heroes with their own destructive abilities what more every single balloon popped gives your units experience allowing them to gain attacks and evolve into more powerful units there also the option to erect structures like spike factories and bomb shooters to cause significant amounts of damage or markets and villages to provide coins and speed boosts to your units apart from the levels that come with the game bloons also features daily challenges and the option to build your own levels that can be uploaded for other gamers to explore will you and your monkeys finally gain the upper hand against these wicked bloonsthis simple to learn strategy game is deceptively fun and packs loads of levels that will keep you coming back to pop round after round of balloons bloons td is one of those games that got a simple premise defeat everything along a path before it gets to your base but it the methods that you use to accomplish these goals that part of the fun honestly when the last time that you deployed a pack of superhero pirate or ninja monkeys to destroy balloons it absurd but it also hilarious and engaging to watch them attack these inflatable enemies with their darts boomerangs or other abilities it also fascinating to see how varied the bloons can be themselves from iron balloons that shrug off most attacks to ceramic balloons that burst smaller orbs forward when shattered you frequently be facing off against a challenging set of odds that only get more intense at higher difficulty levels and the longer you survive each round fortunately as you succeed through these trial and error stages you gain additional experience and unlock powers that can be used to tip the balance of a stage in your favor that provides an additional level of depth as you start to customize and enhance your units to produce more damage cause secondary effects on the field of battle or earn additional cashbut the fun doesn simply stop within the regular campaign there are daily levels released to give you new challenges as well as special events that restrict your units earned cash or pit you against gigantic blimps to test your strategic skills players also have the option to create and upload levels as well ensuring virtually an endless number of challenges for the game community if there was an issue that could be presented about bloons is that it not always clear about some game features it hard to tell why certain pathways are fully closed off for characters after you selected some upgrades over others it just feels arbitrarily determined additionally it can be frustrating to go through an entire level setting up for seemingly every single option only to face a set of bloons on a later level that your forces can possibly destroy but these are minor issues for a game that this deep and entertaining if you a strategy fan or interested in what tower defense games are all about give bloons td a few rounds you have a blastfamilies can talk about trial and error bloons td frequently throws an overwhelming amount of balloons at you until you either succeed or fail a level but what can be learned about this approach to gameplay is it useful to continually fail until you learn how to succeed or should the game give assistance after a while to prevent frustrationdo you enjoy playing as the monkeys in bloons td would you like to have a chance to be the balloons instead what kind of balloons or powers would you want to use if you had the opportunity to control these inflated opponents,en,402.0,Positive

in the game as well as a lot of profanity and sexual comments in the dialogue alcohol use and smoking are also shown in the game as both activities from characters and as resourcesdying light stay human introduces players to a world set fifteen years after a global outbreak of the infamous harran virus first introduced in original dying light what left of humanity has broken up into small settlements struggling to maintain resources while fending off the masses of harran infected zombies you aiden caldwell one of the few surviving pilgrims runners that travel from settlement to settlement acting as everything from courier to gatherer to mercenary depending on the need aiden has survived due in no small part to enhanced strength and stamina granted to him by horrific experimentation done to him as a child now as an adult aiden uses his role as a pilgrim to search clues as to the whereabouts of the man responsible for his traumatic childhood hoping it might bring

original dying light struck a chord with fans by blending the tension of survival horror with fastpaced firstperson parkour the sequel dying light stay human takes everything players liked about the first game and cranks it up to an eleven with a bigger map more moves and a deeper story with real consequences there are big factions such as the militant peacekeepers with their ironclad belief in structure and order and on the opposite end of the spectrum there the chaotic mad maxesque renegades who take what they want from who they want with little regard for pesky things like law and order and in between these two factions lie the various survivor groups with varying amounts of influence or power they tend to just want to live their lives the best way they can hoping that they live to see another sunrise players actions and choices shape the world around them and customize the experience making the game feel much more personal as a result this is even more evident during multiplayer games one player hosts the session in the world they fashioned visiting players on the other hand find themselves in a sort of multiversal splinter world where things might seem familiar but key events have played out differently this might allow visitors access to items and areas closed off in their own worlds or alternatively shut them out of certain things they might be accustomed to in their own playthrough once returning to their own world visitors will bring with them any character progression they may have made but no changes to the base world they started from it an incentive to see how certain choices might have played out for others before making similar decision in your own experienceas far as the rest of the game goes it hard to find much fault with it the game ties to the events of the first dying light rewarding returning players with an expansion of the overall lore but it also set far enough down the road that newcomers can dive right in without needing a primer on everything they might have missed combat is visceral and brutal while there are some weapons that allow you to fight from a distance most require you to get up close and personal which is fine when facing a small group of enemies but when the lights go down and swarms come out you literally need to run for your life the default controls are awkward at the start but begin to feel natural and responsive with practice before long you jumping climbing ducking and dodging with unmatched fluidity the map supposedly four times bigger than the original game feels almost too huge there a lot to explore and a lot of space to cover between points of interest finding safe rooms and unlocking their respective spawn points helps considerably and finally there not enough that can be

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/mario-party-superstars,Mario Party Superstars,parents need to know that mario party superstars is a board game party game exclusively for the nintendo switch this is the latest chapter in the mario party franchise which pits characters from nintendo games against each other in a range of minigames across a series of wacky game boards this particular title pulls many of its minigames and boards from older games acting as both a curator of classic stages and a bit of nostalgia for players while there some violence across some stages because you firing cannons paintballs fruit and other objects at opponents but no blood or gore is shown and the violence is cartoonish in nature otherwise there no inappropriate content to be found in the gamegrab your friends and family and pass around the joycons because it time to compete for top honors in mario party superstars instead of creating new stages to fight across players are presented with game boards from the first three mario party games to explore gamers will select from one of ten classic nintendo characters such as mario donkey kong and yoshi as they roll dice to travel around these locations competing across any one of minigames and earning coins these coins can be used to purchase items to move around the board dice to hinder other players progress or stars to help you make progress towards winning the game and being declared the super star at the end of every game players will earn coins which can be used to purchase gameplay music encyclopedia pages about games in the series stickers that can be used during board game stages to express how you feel during match moments and more players also have the option to dive into a single player experience against computercontrolled opponents local or online multiplayer matches against gamers or they can visit mt minigames to test your skills in vs vs or solo play can you beat your opponents and be declared the super star of every boardthis collection of minigames brings a heavy dose of nostalgia to the nintendo switch along with a ton of competitive fun for players of all ages mario party superstars is a remastered take on the franchise packaging five stages from the first three games of the franchise but the curation doesn stop there because aside from updating the visuals on these stages superstars picks minigames from the nintendo gamecube wii and wii u titles for players to compete through particularly impressive about the gameplay is how surprisingly fair things wind up being over the course of exploring a board even if you spent a ton of time playing mario party games before for example your skills with games won help if you randomly get low dice rolls hampering your advancement around the board while your competition races forward to collect stars but the game also aware of possible imbalances handing out items and even bonus stars at the end of a match to provide nailbiting comebacks for the most part the minigames at the end of a turn or during a versus match are easy to pick up and play within a matter of seconds especially thanks to the practice sessions provided before entering a competition but more importantly they quick events that frequently are completed within a minute or less which creates a frantic but entertaining experience before bringing players back to the larger game boardnot everything about mario party superstars rolls a perfect ten on its dice admittedly some of the minigames are questionable choices tug of war which was infamous for causing blisters on the makes its return and given issues that switch owners have had with joycon sticks in the past it can produce a lot of anxiety to play a game that requires a lot of rotation on the controller for fear that you break or damage the joycon nub similarly other minigames don always have the best instructions for your practice sessions so you wind up practicing a lot more than expected but still may not know how to successfully compete in that game finally and it a nitpicky issue but it a bit odd that for a title that revamps and takes elements from previous games in the franchise it disregards some of the better items from super mario party the last title on the switch only featuring half the selectable characters removing the option to gain allies to provide additional dice rolls and eliminating motion controls feels a bit restrictive or outdated compared to the previous game but these are minor issues compared to the hours of entertainment that are waiting for players on these virtual boards overall mario party superstars rolls up the fun and friendly competition for series vets and newcomers alike and it a great family game night title to play the hardest choices you might have comes down to choosing the character you want to play and the board you want to explorefamilies can talk about competition and teamwork what are the positive elements behind friendly competition is it possible to prevent competitive games from getting out of hand and hurting other player feeling what are some good ways to practice teamwork and can you apply that to other games or real lifewhy are party games fun to play is it the variety of games the randomness of the boards you play on the challenge of defeating your

playstation xbox one xbox series xs nintendo switch and windows pcs it tells the story of a series of teens who have run away from home and are trying to cross the border to escape a democratic country teetering on the brink of despotism some aspects of the regime police brutality manipulative newscasts and government corruption are clearly meant to make players think of similar events that have taken place within the united states choices within dialogue force players to think about whether to use the power of democracy or revolutionary activism including violence to enact change and young people are portrayed as the country hope for the future as teen runaways players must decide what they willing to do to make it to the border choosing whether to help other kids and how far they willing to go to survive and escape opportunity exists for characters to exhibit important character strengths such as compassion integrity and perseverance but they can also make questionable decisions such as stealing and lying some choices will lead to the player character death at which point the game simply moves on to the next teen runaway there are no doovers the developers avoid overt violence but characters get shot offscreen and innocents can be seen crushed by rocks from a distance in a newscast dialogue includes a small amount of light profanity and occasional references to the subject of sex but nothing explicit parents should also note that one scene sees the player teen avatar drinking a strong cocktail and passing out in a barroad provides a scary look at a mirror world in which a democratically elected leader of an americalike country is slowly transforming the nation into an authoritarian state progressiveminded teens who see no future for themselves in this land are running away from home determined to trudge hitchhike bus or even steal cars to get themselves to the border and escape the regime players take on the roles of several of these resolute kids making decisions about what to do when they meet other teens on the run stumbling upon dangerous thieves and psychopaths meeting up with dangerous revolutionaries and taking on odd jobs as a camera operator for a newswoman or a gas jockey at a service station it a firstperson adventure game which means your job is to choose options in dialogue and solve the occasional puzzle such as looking for keys to rooms and lock boxes or using a magnet to maneuver a needed object through an electrified cage but your actions carry consequences say the wrong thing to the scarylooking guy giving you a ride and he might kill you side with the revolutionaries and you may help a terroristlike act of violence steal someone money and you might affect how they treat you at the heart of the story is the idea that though it may not seem like it young people have political will and power whether that means simply vandalizing campaign posters or helping another kid hack into a computer all the while you likely find yourself asking is running away going to solve anythingit a little rough around the edges but this adventure is a thoughtprovoking tale of teens caught in a country ravaged by political forces over which they feel they have no control of course that the clever twist in road every action these teens take whether it stealing from a business owner or helping another kid escape custody from brutal border control officers is an act of political will and their choices have rippling effects that impact the lives of other people they come into contact with players get a good sense of the consequences of their actions via the game clever use of multiple protagonists not only does this allow for a sense of real peril any of these kids can die and the game will simply move on to the next one but players also get to see how a handful of important nonplayer characters are gradually influenced by their encounters with the teen runaways the message is clear kids are potent agents of personal and political change and they wield more power than they might thinkbut this bold narrative ambition would have been better served by a slightly bigger budget road isn ugly but it does suffer dull textures and has plenty of reused assets you see the same gas cans spoiled hamburgers and rustedout cars over and over again throughout your adventure and most of the puzzles and minigames are pretty basic including a pongclone an air hockey table and a shell game with plastic cups these simplistic distractions do little to enhance the experience and at times even serve to break the player sense of immersion detracting from the tension and danger that slowly builds through each teen story get past these minor disruptions though and you bound to grow close to road cast of desperate characters as you follow their worrisome tales to conclusions both uplifting and tragicfamilies can talk about screen time it generally takes around an hour to get through one teen story in road which makes for a good break point do you think stepping away from the game after each teen story might allow you process what happened to them in a more thorough waywhat sort of advantages might an interactive medium that puts players in the roles of others have over other media in getting people to think about timely ideas from a different perspectivedid you choose to make your characters display character strengths such as compassion integrity and perseverance or did you decide to have the teens behave in more selfish and isolated ways what led you to these choices,en,450.0,Negative

visually striking clips thanks to the scapes movies feature ready to stand in the winner circle you have to burn a lot of rubber and clock a lot of miles to prove you the best racer aroundgrab your helmet and start your engines it time to head back to the track with this racer that visually stunning incredibly addicting and constantly challenging it may have been almost a decade since the last full installment of this series but gran turismo has roared back onto playstation consoles with an experience that a clear love letter to cars and car culture whether you tearing through italian hills in a tiny fiat abarth drifting around corners in a ford mustang or offroading in a toyota tundra every vehicle is beautifully reproduced in fact some of the screens feel like you walked away from a game console and into a car showroom and these hero shots of the cars are truly breathtaking especially when you use the scapes feature to place these machines in a vast set of locales taken from around the world but these cars aren simply eye candy because the gear shifting and engine revving during a race feels different thanks to the haptic feedback of the dualsense controller this is even more apparent between the slower pace of a stock machine versus the roar of a car you spent time and credits modifying and tuning to suit your needs what more sprinting around corners with a squeal of tires as you take the curve and exit into a straightaway or feathering your brake and gas pedals to cleanly overcome a hairpin turn just feels may seem like it designed only for hardcore racing fans but newcomers and casual racers will find the gameplay very accessible thanks to the menu system at the ingame caf which gives a minor amount of structure when it comes to courses to enter and challenges to take on once you cleared a number of the campaign elements though and opened up multiplayer races or missions you provided with a better sense of track competition and fastpaced play through various modes like all cars does have some pings and knocks that you uncover as you flying across highways or tarmacs for one thing the number of credits that you earn for a race is incredibly low even with perfectly clean races and racing lines you earn fractions of the number of credits needed to earn a midtier premium or luxury vehicle so you be grinding your way through previously completed races repeatedly to earn credits or sinking cash into the store for the machine you really want also while tuning your cars helps getting a more expensive part isn always the best option for your vehicle in fact it could possibly make your performance worse on the track suggested optimized car kits for certain kinds of races would been useful especially for players who are antsy to dive into the trial and error of tweaking the differential transmission and other specs of their car these issues are minor compared to the rest of the game though which manages to keep you coming back to the track to improve your time land more first place finishes and grow your car collection gran turismo is simply a masterpiece for racing games and whether you like watching races on television or simply enjoy driving your car to handle errands you find something here to get your motor runningfamilies can talk about consumerism gran turismo attention to detail makes all of the included vehicles stand out but is this design solely for realistic gameplay do the sweeping interior and exterior shots also serve to promote and sell these cars to players how does it feel if you shown hundreds of these machines but couldn possibly afford themdo you think you could learn how to become a race car driver by playing gran turismo some gamers have become professional drivers after playing previous installments of gran turismo do you think it was their dedication to this game that helped them or did they have additional advantages that made them better suited to turn their racing hobby into a

free download the kart and the gates that players have to buy to race around your house cost a piece previoulsy the cost was but thanks to a recent update for the game and subsequent price drop as well as a new splitscreen feature that will allow players to play on one switch as well as a relay race feature to let up to four players swap controls between laps that makes gameplay vastly more affordable than before players will use shells stars and other items to attack other racers on the race course who will slow down or stop temporarily when hit the attacks are cartoonish and not violent in any way although they can sometimes cause carts to crash into objects in your house aside from that there no inappropriate content in the game players should be aware though that while the kart is easy to control your challenge is based off the track you build the speed class of the race and certain track conditionsmario kart live home circuit is the latest chapter in the popular racing franchise but this one comes with a significant twist instead of racing around new tracks on your screen in vibrant locations mario or luigi if you choose will take his racing skills to a new arena your house home circuit is an augmented reality game that split in two parts there the physical part which consists of physical cardboard gates signs and an actual kart with a camera that you charge and drive wirelessly with your switch the digital part is a free to download game that presents nine separate racing cups eight themed plus a cup that pulls random tracks from the previously played circuits or time trials players will set up their courses in their house using furniture and their imagination to construct tracks and will choose from one of four speed classes ranging from to races

that allows up to four players to swap joycons between laps can you take the checkered flag and conquer each racing trackthis racing game manages to capture the fun of the franchise and with its adjusted price the space of your house may be its biggest obstacle to the winner circle nintendo is wellknown for its peripherals and mario kart live home circuit is the latest in the company tradition of thinking outside of the box or in this case outside of the tv thanks to a clever melding of the wireless kart and its camera along with a set of cardboard gates players can create and recreate any series of tracks they can think of to test their racing skills around their house it hard to not be blown away by just how innovative the kart and the course creation is after just a few minutes of play the kart is extremely responsive and is able to move from carpet to hardwood or tile floors without missing a beat lower speed settings may crawl as it tries to get traction on these surfaces while higher speeds have no issue here in fact you be up and ready to build racetracks within minutes and if you want you can swap them between races to test your skills on new tracks you create it also very cool to discover how the game scatters in coins question blocks and environmental threats across the virtual landscape in your house to give you a challenge sure some of your opponents may drive through furniture or other obstacles that you see through the kart camera since they aren actually real but for the most part they follow the course that you initially designed what also notable is that the karts have pretty solid battery life you can get at least two hours on slower speed classes but it be shorter as you race at faster speeds especially as the kart whips around corners the sense of speed from the kart especially at is incredible as well it adds an extra challenge to your races as you drift around corners or find yourself spinning out on hairpin curves from going too fast the latest update to version adds some nice features as well like the new luigi cup with three new courses windmill meadows and music broadway are fun tracks but the stand out is king boo courtyard which flips the screen upside down and places large boos in your view it also fantastic to see the addition of splitscreen play making it vastly easier for more people to play on one system as well as relay race so multiple people can trade off between laps it helps more players hop behind the wheel and boosts the fun even better the price has been cut in half so it more affordable than ever to grab karts and get racinghome circuit isn perfect especially if you happen to have pets who will frequently choose to turn the kart into a new toy to chase around the house you definitely restricted by the amount of space you might have in your house so you may have to become creative with your course layouts to keep the gameplay fresh in fact changing the layouts does become a challenge to prevent things from becoming repetitive because it up to you to make courses different instead of relying on the tracks that nintendo has developed in previous mario kart games if you have the space are willing to create courses on your own and are looking for a unique racing experience look no further than mario kart live home circuitfamilies can talk about marketing mario kart live home circuit can be fun but do you want to spend money for a physical kart or would you rather play a match of mario kart deluxe for the same pricedo you think that you have more respect for

subtle allusions to sexaloy is charged once again with saving humanity in horizon forbidden west sequel to the playstationexclusive scifi saga horizon zero dawn the story picks up with aloy a clone of a woman who existed a millennium in the past just before machines wiped out all life on earth discovering that the planet isn yet out of the woods machinedriven environmental catastrophe is mere months away and the only way to stave off the disaster is for her to search for the solution in the forbidden west a place few easterners have gone because of the powerful local tribes that control the region as players explore these sprawling freetoroam lands they meet and befriend plenty of people who need help in tasks such as feeding their villages quashing a murderous rebellion and facing down the menacing threat of massive machine animals that have lately grown aggressive aloy also collects and crafts upgrades for a variety of armors and weapons each with strategic advantages that allow her to more effectively hunt machines by exploiting elemental weaknesses she also target specific weak spots to gradually remove plating weapons and components over the course of tense and epic confrontations between battles the world offers a plethora of ancient ruins to explore contextual puzzles to solve and fragments of data to find that paint a clearer picture of the final days before machines ended the world players can expect to spend at least hours and potentially upwards of exploring everything that forbidden west has to offersequels don get much better than this horizon forbidden west puts the franchise captivating scifi story front and center further exploring this new civilization of humans grown from stored dna following the eradication of all biomass on earth it expands on the original fascinating premise including ideas hinted at but not fully explored in the first game such as what mysteries may lie in the far west and what really happened to that mysterious project to send humanity to another star system the result is a gripping adventure that sees aloy searching for answers and making some shocking discoveries along the way she remains a beautifully realized character fierce intelligent and physically capable but with a reasonable amount of selfdoubt as well as some minor character flaws that only make her more human like her deepseated obsession with her mission that allies sometimes misinterpret as a coldness players will become invested in her as a character fearing for her physical and emotional wellbeing in tense situations basking in the praise she receives from those she helps and laughing along when she cracks the occasional joke this is largescale storytelling and worldbuilding at its best anchored by one of the most likable and fully developed characters in modern gamesthat the rest of the experience is a match for the narrative is just a bonus the visual presentation is simply jawdropping with light from vivid living skies flowing over mountains and filtering through the branches of towering redwoods to the landscape below which is filled with fields of flowers mosscovered ruins and orange desert dunes dotted with dust devils this setting is a luscious backdrop for the wildly intense and strategic combat which only gets better as you learn to use all of the many traps weapons combinations and elemental abilities at aloy disposal the satisfaction that comes with anchoring a giant machine bird to the ground with a ropecaster blowing off its armor plating with precision arrows soaking it in acid with slingshot bombs to weaken it and then letting another bird you overridden swoop in to peck it to death is tangible it not a perfect game most players will reach aloy level cap well before the story end scaling walls and cliffs can be a little awkward at times and the occasional glitch might pull players out of this grand fantasy for a couple of seconds here and there but these problems barely dent the overall vibe horizon forbidden west is a magnificently ambitious followup that somehow manages to outdo its much beloved predecessor in almost every wayfamilies can talk about screen time horizon forbidden west is a huge game in which it easy to lose oneself for long periods of time how long do you usually play before getting up and taking a break to engage in more physical

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/norco,NORCO,parents need to know that norco is a downloadable singleplayer pointandclick adventure game available for windows and mac as the main character kay players explore a futuristic southern louisiana going down a rabbit hole of mystery intrigue and horror to find kay missing brother and uncover the secrets of her deceased mother there one instance of suicide players see a silhouette of a person performing the act and violence in general is prominent throughout in the form of the gruesome aftermath of horrific vicious actions cursing is also common and sexual references are tame and infrequent some characters get visibly drunk teenagers talk about getting high and take psychedelic drugs and people become addicted to drugs due to their unfavorable circumstances the game controls are easy to learn and master and norco also features a faithful representation of louisiana customs nuances and citizens in interesting innovative ways the story can get quite dark in tone and morally ambiguous at times which mostly blocks out obvious clear good morals and lessons for those seeking themin norco kay returns to louisiana after the death of her mother she quickly discovers that her brother one of her last remaining family members has mysteriously vanished so she springs into action to find him haunted by the memories of a past she been trying desperately to avoid kay will encounter many eccentric people both familiar and new who further complicate kay journey intentionally or otherwise shield an oil refinery company partly responsible for louisiana downfall after a series of floods decimated the region and lives of its citizens finds itself entangled in a mission to find a specific item that could change louisiana for the better in the right hands yet there an obstacle that just wandered back into town who may throw a wrench in their plans in the midst of all this before kay mother passed she was quite a prominent figure in the area who harbored her own secrets and designs and kay will find that it not so easy to separate herself from what come before and what very well may come soon with louisiana on its last legs kay has to decide if the darkness that lines the path toward the truth and salvation is worth traveling survival has a strange way of pushing people to do things they wouldn normally doit rare when a game leaves you so effortlessly speechless and words seem to be unable to properly represent how incredible the experience is norco formula is half classic pointandclick and half visual novel with a turnbased fighting mechanic to spice things up further to single out its one strongest element would do it a great disservice as it swings for the fences in terms of storytelling writing visuals and soundtrack and proceeds to knock it out of the park in every category haunting surreal and beautiful all in one package norco creates a futuristic nightmare for the residents of southern louisiana that displays not only the nuances of the region itself but also its many varied residents by the end of the game even if you never visited louisiana enough love has been poured into the fictional recreation of the area you feel as if you lived there your entire lifethe game can absolutely be played impatiently for those who just want to experience the main story without indulging in any extra dialogue with characters or clicking on random objects and reading the wonderfully written descriptions but where some pointandclick games suffer from bloated dialogue that adds nothing of substance norco wastes not a single eloquent word seamlessly making everything you click on relevant to the story characters or setting you can practically hear what certain characters sound like when they speak as every person you encounter no matter how minor has their own personality and quirks paired with the excellent writing are the game pixel art visuals which give louisiana an unsettling gritty darkness where nothing is as it seems and to trust would be to potentially meet an early end if you someone accustomed to figuring out plot developments be prepared for many surprises because norco doesn hold back sometimes it morbid sometimes it heartfelt and sometimes it just makes you laugh its turnbased fighting feature proves to be the icing on a wellmade cake as a fun diversion and the puzzles that are typical of the pointandclick adventure game genre are fun and interesting without spoiling the story or characters as this is a game that deserves players going in as blind as possible the plot contains a pitchperfect sense of progression and character development as events come to a head and the characters are all morally complex and engaging as most are victims of bad circumstances beyond their control wildly creative and impactful beyond its end credits norco is a mindblowing trip to the bayous swamps and refineries of a downtrodden louisiana that anyone who enjoys an unforgettable story should embrace as soon as possiblefamilies can talk about underrepresented settings and locations in games eg southern louisiana which appears in norco what are some other areas or regions with a rich background and history that video games could take on in meaningful ways what aspects of such regions could be focused on and how could those differences be applied to create an engaging unique experiencethe complexities of morality in dire situations come up quite a bit in norco what situations can you imagine where you think you make harsh decisions you wouldn normally make if the quality of people lives is at risk can you see how people could resort to desperate actions just to survive from one day to the next is it the fault of one individual for making a bad decision to maintain their life if the system of laws and rules that informs their existence seems to work against them is that blame shared why or why not what can be done to fix a flawed system of laws and rules so as to prevent desperate people from having to commit harmful acts in the first place,en,491.0,Positive

mayor of the fictional floatio city they will use military units and experimental scientific weapons to push back the kaiju and save their town at the game forefront is determination and adaptability as the kaiju constantly evolve causing the charactersand players of the gameto think of new strategies at any given moment to win the battle and figure out how to stop the kaiju for good despite the war being waged against the kaiju the ultimate goal is less about their destruction and more the need to calm them down and try to understand where they came from in terms of violence the game visuals keep the action cartoony and tame if you been wary of the strategy genre before and how complicated some of the games can be kaiju wars eases players into it teaches them every step of the way and wants them to overcome its many challengesin kaiju wars the world is being attacked by massive monsters known as kaiju you the mayor of floatio city must assemble your military forces to push the creatures back and save your city but at what cost they can be killed they can only be temporarily soothed into a calm state via a scientific serum so as not to destroy the entire town you being watched by a group hidden in the shadows seemingly pleased with the destruction the kaiju cause but why that up to you the player to figure out as you go through six acts uncovering a different layer to the ongoing mystery of the kaiju where did they come from have they been put here by a divine being to punish humanity for its sins have they been here before us and are now reclaiming the world we created for ourselves centuries ago perhaps they manmade maybe someone somewhere wants to use them to dominate the world and make themselves the ruler of every living being through kaiju domination these are the questions that will arise as you make your way from town to town saving people from a living nightmare hopefully you figure it all out before the kaiju complete their rampage throughout the entire worldvery few games so expertly combine charm and skill into one package kaiju wars does exactly that and then some a true love letter to the movies featuring gigantic destructive monsters kaiju wars does everything right from the moment you start the game and see the many screens depicting various scenes from classic blackandwhite kaiju films setting players up for what to come strategy games tend to have a difficult time bringing in new players because they need to have control over a wide range of minor details which can be overwhelming kaiju wars introduces its mechanics slowly and in a way that easy to understand and once players get a firm grasp on how things work it soars to new heightsyou start out as a brute simply throwing everything you have at the kaiju but there comes a point where the strength and number of your units aren enough the kaiju are immensely powerful and the game does a perfect job of mimicking the movies it idolizes and making you earn every victory against these behemoths you have projects you can deploy which are cards you can use every turn to sway the battle in your favor like boosting a unit slowing down monsters or building more structures but a mysterious force also has dark projects it can use against you that can throw your bestlaid plans into total disarray even after a loss players learn how to refine their methods to win next time and once skill meets the ability to adapt to whatever is thrown at the player hours of sheer strategic bliss are sure to follow the games visuals are gorgeous with the main campaign structured like a comic book this lets players follow a central set of missions including challenging optional side missions while throwing in a fun cast of lovable characters all trying to get to the bottom of the mysteries surrounding the kaiju these missions are occasionally broken up with news reports featuring real actors detailing the world varied often funny reactions to the kaiju menace even the sense of progression from the beginning of the campaign to the end is paced brilliantly with the kaiju constantly evolving to expand the player strategies against them the design of the levels always changing and the growing number and variety of projects you unlock and utilize along the way kaiju wars is a game not unlike an actual kaiju threat it one thing to hear about it and potentially shrug it off but once it makes itself known it a beast unlike anything you ever experiencedfamilies can talk about patience and critical thinking two central skills required to play kaiju wars does the slower more structured gameplay of a strategy game allow younger audiences to better learn retain and apply information if not is a faster more chaotic pace better for encouraging growth and learning skills whywhen you think about the standard kaiju media experience do you think of senseless destruction and chaos without a purpose or is there something more to consider should all forms of entertainment seek to instruct educate or teach a lesson or can it be beneficial for some things to just be fun and entertaining without a deeper meaning,en,441.0,Positive

cooperation for a scientific or cultural victory converting the rest of the world to their civilization beliefs for a religious victory or building up massive armies with an aim to crush every other empire combat generally pretty mild with tiny groups of soldiers viewed from a perspective high in the sky automatically attacking each other without blood or gore shown parents should also know that

extra content beyond the base game including additional leaders civilizations and scenarios players looking for a shorter game with specific objectives can try colonizing australia without combat conquering europe as a viking leader or defending poland from a host of aggressors these quicker lightly directed scenarios suit the switch experience very well especially when playing on the goof course as with any port to new hardware civilization vi move to switch brings over the occasional quirk one of these is that text details of notifications are now pushed to a separate screen rather than automatically popping up on the right side of the display as they do in other versions of the game presumably to keep the switch smaller display from becoming cluttered and crowded with information this can leave you blind to other civilizations strategies and your own cities troubles if you don take the time to check them so make sure you do especially if you see a red alert notification pop up but sid meier civilization vi on switch is by and large a smashing success it fun educational strategic and inspiring whether this is your first time jumping into sid meier human history simulation or you a diehard fan of the pc series and just want the ability to build empires on the go it earns an easy wholehearted recommendationfamilies can talk about screen time it can be hard to stop playing a game like sid meier civilization vi which constantly prompts players to take their next turn so how long should a healthy play session lastwhat qualities are important for a

villager transforms into the archillager and begins ransacking the world with an army of monsters one or more if playing cooperative multiplayer human heroes feel compelled to set out and stop this new villain before he can bring ruin to the land players explore a highly pixelated world viewed from a raised perspective using swords axes hammers bows and arrows explosives and magic to take on hordes of zombies witches spiders and other aggressive creatures combat sees enemies falling and occasionally breaking apart but there no gore or blood and the retro graphics almost make it look as though characters are made of toy building blocks further reducing the intensity of battle parents should note that as a minecraft spinoff this game has an enormous builtin fan base of kids who will be clamoring to play and while the base game inexpensive paid downloadable content encourages players to spend more money to unlock additional avatar skins and levelsminecraft dungeons an official spinoff of minecraft one of the world most popular games nixes all of the resource collection and crafting activities of the original game in favor of a classic dungeon crawling experience the game begins with the story of a misunderstood and mistreated villager getting fed up and becoming the archillager a villain who summons an army of monsters to lay waste to towns and countryside playing alone or in groups of up to four locally or online players take on the role of nameless heroes who set out to defeat the archillager the hack slash play is spread out across randomly generated dungeons set in caves deserts forests and other classic minecraft biomes where players will encounter zombies witches spiders and even minecraft classic endermen villains as the game progresses players loot gemstones weapons armor and other gear from treasure chests many of these items can be enhanced and imbued with special abilities and effects via enchantment points earned for leveling up the base game short paid dlc will bring new levels that continue the story but the randomly generated dungeons unlockable difficulty levels and constant quest for more powerful loot are meant to keep players coming back for some timeso long as players don go in expecting the depth and complexity of a traditional dungeon crawler or the freedom and creativity of minecraft there plenty of fun to be had here minecraft dungeons does a brilliant job of streamlining typical dungeon crawler play to make it accessible to players of all skill and experience levels combat blissfully straightforward just press a button to hack with your melee weapon or pull a trigger to fire an arrow and little time is wasted sorting through heaps of gear in complex menus just about anyone can pick up the basics and start having fun hacking away at monsters in a matter of minutes and it even more fun in groups especially since the developers have wisely headed off any potential loot sharing conflicts by reserving important gear drops for each player fans of more advanced dungeon crawlers will likely pine for features such as classes crafting and more sophisticated loot management but they already have games like diablo iii this one meant to be much more accessible and kidfriendlysome minecraft fans are bound to miss the mining and constructing elements of the original but there no mistaking this for a minecraft game from its classic blocky graphics to an endless array of quirky minecraft flourishes pickaxes mine carts redstone blocks and endermen to name just a few the aesthetic is distinctly minecraft that said there room for improvement the mazelike dungeons are pretty to look at and fun to explore but they and the combat that takes place within them can become a little repetitive a few more complex puzzles and traps would have made for a nice change of pace keep in mind too that while randomly generated dungeons provide good incentive to replay it also makes for some needlessly confusing level architecture and pointless dead ends you can tell these dungeons weren handcrafted by humans minecraft dungeons is wonderfully easy to jump into and play loads of fun with family and friends and keeps the combat family friendly so long as you don go in thinking you getting a dungeon crawler with the intricacy and depth of a fullpriced game you bound to have a great timefamilies can talk about violence in the media is the impact of the violence in minecraft dungeons affected by its pixelated graphics which effectively reduces the intensity of combat how do you think the game

young acrobat who run away from the circus to pursue his dream of becoming an international psychic spy or psychonaut as the latest agent in training raz has already proven himself in saving a psychic summer camp and rescued the head of the psychonauts from being kidnapped but it appears that he and his fellow agents are facing their toughest assignment yet not only have they discovered that there a mole in their headquarters threatening their security but they also learned that schemes are in place to bring a dangerous psychic threat to life that could destroy the world players will roam through a series of stages in the minds of friends and enemies looking for clues to prevent this disaster over the course of the adventure raz will unlock new psychic abilities gain additional gear like pins to boost these skills and find a ton of collectibles to strengthen his stats in taking on the mental threats that attempt to block his progress will raz be able to uncover the mole and stop the latest threat before it too latethis actionadventure title deftly balances exploring mental issues and concerns with humor and clever play to make a remarkable experience that hard to forget while psychonauts builds on the plots of the previous games in the series you don need to have played those two titles to enjoy this tale in fact a recap video sums up the events of those games while laying the groundwork for this adventure which tosses you almost immediately into the action without spoiling any story points this is an engaging tale of revenge deception redemption acceptance and healing with raz life and everything he known getting turned upside down on a regular basis given the unfair circumstances raz faces along with some merciless teasing from family and fellow young psychonauts he should become bitter or unhappy taking things out on something but he an incredibly good kid who only wants to help people and you can help but cheer for him throughout the entire story gameplay is incredibly engaging and plenty of tips are given to raz by his fellow psychonauts on using his powers exploring environments and defeating enemies when they first appear this lets you focus on the story as well as fending off attacks from all sides and collecting tons of collectibles such as ore that can be spent for upgrades finding and tagging mental baggage or grabbing figments of imagination in fact there a ton of collectibles side missions and quests so many that you probably won be able to complete everything on the first playthroughwhat also impressive about psychonauts is how it manages to handle and treat mental issues in a sensitive way while still keeping the game offthewall humor much of the game is tongue in cheek with its jokes and comments but the personification of emotions like regrets that try to drop weights on you to hold you down or censors that try to block thoughts or psychonauts that don belong in a mind is very clever it allows players to fight against negative ideas defeating them while accomplishing goals while also exploring more serious issues like addiction anxieties and delusions if you struggling with these conditions some scenes could possibly be distressing but on the plus side this could prompt discussion for some kids and older gamers possibly leading to them wanting help for these issues at least psychonauts suggests a mental health resource for any players who may feel affected and hopefully parents and gamers alike will take advantage of this if any problems arise overall psychonauts is an excellent and very thoughtful tale but hopefully it doesn take another years for another game in the franchisefamilies can talk about mental health psychonauts adresses a number of mental health concepts including turning negative emotions into enemies that can be faced and defeated is this the best way to address these concepts should negative emotions be destroyed or is it better to figure out a way to acknowledge and understand why someone would have these feelings in the first placeshould adults listen and learn from kids or should they just focus on teaching what they learned to younger

control and keeps that living board game with friends feeling alive and well in both versions it feels less like a video game and more like a causal game night gatheringit when the action unfolds that

take on the role of robots in a futuristic dueling arena facing off against each other with a variety of weapons play is easy to learn and grasp although the game questionable matchmaking can cause you to face off against the same opponent multiple times in a row or fight a player that clearly more skilled than you resulting in lopsided contests the timing on weapons being refreshed for use also tends to vary possibly leaving you vulnerable to attack you toss grenades fire energy weapons and shoot bullets of varying colors but there no blood or gore shown and players can actively dodge out of the way to avoid contact with these projectiles there no profanity in the game dialogue although there are rooms and lobbies where conversation between players is unmoderated possibly exposing players to inappropriate comments players will also see panels in arenas advertising the developer and a haptic vest company that works with the content found in the game otherwise there no inappropriate content parents should also be aware that virtual reality equipment makers don recommend vr experiences for kids under due to the potential impact the technology may have on younger players physiological developmentblaston is a virtual dueling game where players take on the role of robots facing off against each other in digital arenas instead of running around a location you placed high above the arena floor on a pedestal across from your opponent who similarly elevated for the competition players will select their weapon loadout before a match starts choosing weapons like rapid fire pistols shotguns and grenades to use against their opponents each weapon has a limited number of uses before they run out of ammunition forcing you to discard the gun and wait for it to regenerate out of thin air but players can also toss their guns at incoming fire or shoot at incoming bullets to limit the amount of damage they can potentially take similarly they can physically bend and dodge out of the way avoiding fire if possible the goal is to hit your opponent enough to take their life bar down to zero twice which earns you items like money experience points and league standing on the global leaderboards when you not playing ai bots or challenging other players gamers have the option of exploring a virtual lounge playing darts custom made arcade games or handing out with other players a new single player campaign also adds in five harder robots to fight against to dominate the virtual arenas of this digital citywhile getting into virtual gunfights can be amusing for a while the shallow campaign and clunky matchmaking causes this game to misfire too often to be enjoyable blaston is a game with a very simple premise you face off against another player or ai competitor to see who the best shooter is in two out of three rounds there a wide variety of weapons which helps keep things fresh just like the ability to shoot incoming bullets out of the air it also a lot of fun to imagine that you neo from the matrix physically ducking and dodging out of the way while returning fire but play for a little while and you see the issues start to stack up matchmaking is horribly broken and unbalanced when you starting out you may be matched up against more skilled veterans that can wipe you out with better weapons and duck behind better shields even worse you get repeatedly matched up against the same player even if there are plenty of other people online to fight against it not just competition you scrambling against in the middle of battle you may have to wait longer than expected for a gun to reappear leaving you defenseless plus instead of putting weapons in your line of sight they sometimes spawn behind you without onscreen indications of where they are leaving you open to a shot in the back as you turn to search for themthe recently introduced campaign mode could added a lot of depth but it very shallow here you face off against a computer opponent with a slick intro that shows off what the game can do but once you defeat your opponent the game adds padding by forcing you to play random arcade games or darts in the lobby between rounds it unnecessary it distracts from the dueling gameplay and it highlights that there not really a story or anything to keep you engaged as a result you probably hop in for a round or two against other players once in a while but you may not stay long enough to become a blaston veteranfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in blaston affected by the fact that you robots facing off against each other in battle arenas without blood or gore would the impact be intensified if you faced off against other opponents or if you were playing as a human instead of machineswhat the appeal of dueling games is it to show off your skills against another player whether that controlled by a human or a computer is it the test of your reaction time and your aim is it the competition

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/minecraft,Minecraft,parents need to know that minecraft is a multiplatform sandbox adventure game players explore the world and use the building blocks of the game to customize that world to create nearly anything they can imagine that also means other players can create whatever they can imagine as well which could potentially lead to younger players coming across potentially offensive content while exploring random worlds online the game is relatively simple to pick up and play but is still complicated when it comes to building more complex items and structures although minecraft is a standalone game its popularity has led to a variety of licensed and unlicensed products downloadable content and more all of which look to cash in on the success of the original game the latest iteration a nintendo switch version includes the wii u version super mariothemed content from character skins to puzzles to music which could get players interested in those games as well it also most impressively includes an authentic minecraft experience whether you on the go or holding still this is an edge over previous portable versions in that you can play splitscreen with up to four playersminecraft is a virtual sandbox that gives players all the tools they need to explore a vast world harvest resources and create nearly everything they can possible imagine the story in minecraft is whatever the player wants it to be as players customize their worlds and the creatures in it and how they choose to interact one world might feature the aftermath of a zombie apocalypse with players forced to build a mighty fortress to withstand the nightly onslaught of the undead hordes while another world may be a peaceful zen garden that encourages visitors to find tranquility throughout the minecraft multiverse are infinite possibilities and it up to you to create your own like the wii u edition the switch edition of the game also features mariothemed puzzles character skins and music from that franchise and mariothemed versions of the overworld the nether the end and more new mods such as home sweet hmm also attempt to teach kids digital citizenship and online safety concepts by instructing them about the hazards of clicking on links sharing passwords and trusting others onlinethere an adage that in life you only get out of it what you willing to put into it and that completely true with this creative adventure you literally dropped in the middle of nowhere with nothing more than your wits starting off you pick up some wood from a tree which you use to make a batch of sticks then you attach some more wood to those sticks and make a pickaxe using that pickaxe you can mine some stone to help build a house and so goes the cycle of the game you spend your time exploring the world around you and harvesting what you can to help create what you need over time you learn more about how to find and build more complex materials and tools combining them to craft new intricate creations it a heavy investment of time and research and it likely to cause even the most hardcore gamer some frustration from time to time but the payoff can be fulfilling the newest version on the nintendo switch includes a formidable tutorial that likely to confuse as many new players as it helps but by and large the best way to learn minecraft is to just start playing minecraft if you are new to minecraft the nintendospecific touches help it feel less unfamiliar the switch edition bursts with an extra super mario texture pack a set of super mario skins for your characters and an entire super mariothemed world to explore with mario themed music and huge statues of mario himselfminecraft does its best to be all

forces of evil while trying to maintain their homesteads zombies skeleton creepers endermen and more come out in force when the sun goes down forcing the players to craft strong defenses if they hope to see the next sunrise for those gamers who are less about using an arsenal and more about using a toolbox there creative mode this is essentially the game god mode where you get full access to everything in the minecraft wheelhouse without having to worry about such things as hostile mobs hunger or other things that might cut short your time in the world here players can build to their hearts content crafting and testing extravagant projects before sharing them with the world even newer mods like the home sweet hmm mod has been used to teach users about internet safety while the mod is relatively short and easy to go through within about minutes for experienced players the fact that the game also attempting to educate while entertaining is notable for users one thing to keep in mind though is the fact that at any given moment there are thousands of other people thinking up things to build as well for every intricate highly detailed recreation of some building game or other such massive undertaking there going to be someone who has used the tools at their disposal to make something juvenile obscene or otherwise offensive and unfortunately there no way to really know what you getting into until you joined another player game this is definitely one time parents should keep an eye on where their kids are visiting online but once you know what you doing you be hardpressed to leave your computer without placing just one more blockfamilies can talk about creativity what inspires your creativity and what would you build if you were given the right toolstalk about online

criminals players kill not only fellow gangsters but also police officers and innocent civilians using both weapons and vehicles while conducting premeditated crimes including a particularly disturbing scene involving torture women are frequently depicted as sexual objects with a strip club minigame allowing players to fondle dancers bodies which are nude from the waist up players also have the opportunity to make characters use marijuana and drink alcohol both of which impact their perception of the world all of the main characters are criminals who think of themselves first and others rarely at all online modes allow players to create their own avatar and embark on a criminal career that includes armed robberies corruption and murder there some diversity within the cast including people of varying skin colors backgrounds and sexual orientation but virtually no characters here could be considered appropriate role models few games are more clearly targeted to an adult audienceoriginally launched in rockstar games decidedly adultoriented grand theft auto v has been remastered for newer consoles including playstation and xbox series xs the story mode puts players in the shoes of a trio of criminals in los santos a fictionalized version of los angeles one protagonist is middleaged and begins the game as a recently retired criminal another is unpredictable cruel and dependent on drugs and the third is a young man just beginning his life of crime players have the ability to switch freely among these men as they work through a dramatic criminal saga set in an open world that sees them carrying out heists stealing cars taking revenge on rivals and killing anyone who gets in their way including police officers and innocent civilians the popular multiplayer mode gta online meanwhile allows players to create a unique avatar before setting out on a freeform criminal career with activities ranging from bank robberies and car theft to assassinations and shooting down airplanes in addition to more traditional adversarial multiplayer modes such as deathmatch and capture the flag the remastered edition sports enhanced graphics including support for hdr ray tracing resolution and framespersecond refresh speeds as well as a career builder mode for gta online that lets firsttime players begin with millions of dollars to help them buy properties and gear so that they can catch up to longtime gta players who have the ability to transfer over their characters from older platformsthis isn a game for kids beyond its glamorized depiction of crime greed and violence grand theft auto v is filled with mature satire both obvious and nuanced some of which hasn aged very well that younger audiences are bound to take at face value that said it also an expertly designed game that remains surprisingly playable and engaging it gives players a vibrant and authentic world bursting with activities and things to discover tight controls that seamlessly transition between various actions and a cleverly designed story that puts the player in the shoes of three separate characters pushing each narrative forward at its own pace newly added features in remastered versions of the game ranging from vastly improved loading times and enhanced audio to subtle new haptic feedback and contextual trigger sensitivity when using the playstation controller have helped this game remain relevant and widely played much longer than mostgta online is bound to be where most folks spend the bulk of their time though newer editions allow players to skip the opening part of the story mode altogether which was required in earlier editions in order to teach people how to play and jump straight into rockstar multiplayer universe where almost nothing scripted and pretty much anything goes what more the new career builder gives players million up front and lets them set themselves up as a gun runner the operator of a shady nightclub a corrupt ceo or a bike gang leader gta online provides endless opportunity for players to indulge dark criminal fantasies while testing their mettle against other players just keep in mind though that just about everything here online and off is geared for adult audiences and even then it won be to all tastes grand theft auto v is well made and entertaining but unequivocally inappropriate for kidsfamilies can talk about the impact of violence in media do you think violent games like grand theft auto v have a different or more significant impact on behavior than violent movies books or musicvillains make for popular protagonists across all media but might be viewed differently in games since players actually perform their dirty deeds rather than simply observe them so can an antihero ever be a good role modeldoes

for the seemingly random massacre of his family using daggers swords and bows and arrows players will travel throughout the fictional world of anargal cutting through a religious group known as the greater heaven who have taken the region over and rule with an iron fist violence is a heavy focus of the game as players will carve a path of destruction through many religious zealots which will inevitably create a lot of bloodshed using stealth players can cut the throats of their foes or strike them down in swordbased combat during one of the animated cutscenes a character gets stabbed in the stomach and blood spurts out of the wound a major location of the main quest is a brothel where scantily clad women are seen dancing seductively on stages one of the major themes of the game is vengeance which is prominent throughout the story and is never challenged in a meaningful way the game controls are unresponsive and frustrating as players will spend more time fighting to simply move around rather than fighting the enemies they encounter there infrequent but strong profanity as well such as st and bastard in dialoguein winter ember arthur artorias the son of the wealthy artorias family is enjoying a night at home when suddenly the artorias manor is stormed by thenunknown assailants everybody from the family to the butler to one of the women arthur is spending the night with

question that been haunting him since the massacre who did it and why taking a boat back to his hometown of anargal arthur finds that things are quite different a religious group known as the greater heaven has served as the rulers of anargal and soon prove to be ruthless toward those who don fall in line with their beliefs with friends being few and far between will arthur be able to find the people who orchestrated the nearcomplete erasure of the artorias legacy from the history books or will the greater heaven catch up to him and ensure that he pays the ultimate price of his numerous sinsoccasionally a game will come along that perhaps would been better off existing in a different medium like a television show or a graphic novel winter ember contains one sole positive and that the animated cutscenes that players are treated to every once in a while throughout their journey to drive the story along as a stealth game winter ember drops the ball by having basic movement feel like a constant hassle there no dedicated jump button rolls frequently aren registered resulting in deaths entirely out of player control and movement is severely restricted getting you stuck in objects and forcing you to reload checkpoints to make progress enemies may even notice a sneaking player behind them without even turning around what worse is the system to either knock out an enemy or slit their throats while this should provide a sense of tension for navigating a level the hitormiss nature of how stealth works leaves a feeling dread whenever an enemy shows up because success or failure depends on whether the game feels like functioning as it should combat is imprecise and lumbering resulting in enemies hitting you even if you try to dodge their attacksthe voice acting is terrible ranging from overdramatic to underperformed also the game forces players into doing objectives a certain way taking away their freedom of choice some objectives are made unclear requiring players to interact with objects they know to be inaccessible to trigger a few lines of bad dialogue that will only then point them to the next objective getting lost and spending a longer time than necessary in a room is likely too as objects you need to crouch under or otherwise interact with won be highlighted in any way which is a frustrating ordeal when virtually every aspect of the game is undercooked regrettably this is one such experience where even if it offered to you for free it still find ways to confuse and disappoint youfamilies can talk about the concept of vengeance a core dilemma in winter ember if you wronged by another person is it good to do something equally bad to them to make things right are there better ways to resolve such a problem that doesn result in the situation spiraling out of control identify some ways you can deescalate a hostile situation or methods you can utilize to keep yourself levelheaded when people hurt youseeing as winter ember features religious

goblins living underground players travel through a series of dungeons using axes hammers and swords outfitting their characters with armor and helmets to battle the goblin horde though your main goal is fighting goblins the violence is mild with no blood or gore the core of the game contains a story about an impending war between goblins and humans with a focus on developing both sides of the conflict rather than simply saying that the humans are correct and the goblins are bloodthirsty savages who deserve to be slain in droves this builds to a strong condemnation of war and the costs involved with the protagonists questioning their actions and growing from their initial ignorance and lack of responsibility the game also offers many accessibility options that can temper the game inherent challenging difficulty allowing players to make themselves stronger use special abilities more often and even slow enemies attacks the twins use plenty of profanity throughout the game but

xbox one playstation nintendo switch and windowsbased pcs primary gameplay consists of two teams of six players each fighting each other for control of specific areas or objectives characters battle using a variety of weapons and special abilities ranging from more realistic handguns and melee weapons to overthetop futuristic superpowers although the violence is a big part of the relatively nonstop action there very little in the way of blood the basics are easy to learn though the game large roster of unique characters and abilities adds an extra layer of complexity to the experience overwatch features a widely diverse roster of characters from every corner of the globe representing a range of genders races cultures sexualities and even species while there no profanity in the actual game the online matches could expose players to offensive language from other players parents should also be aware that overwatch includes microtransactions in the form of loot boxes which contain cosmetic additions and can be earned through gameplay or special promotions or purchased via the ingame shopin overwatch it been years since humanity fought against artificial intelligence in the global war known as the omnic crisis overwatch was the international task force formed by the united nations to keep the peace between humans and ai the heroes of overwatch continued to protect the world for years becoming a beacon of hope to the people then things began to change accusations of corruption and criminal activity began to tarnish the reputation of overwatch leading to the unexplained destruction of the team headquarters branded as criminals traitors and even worse overwatch was officially disbanded with no one to stand against the forces of evil peace is being threatened once again despite being divided disgraced and disavowed the world needs the heroes of overwatch now more than ever but who will answer the callfor years blizzard entertainment has made a name for itself by crafting amazing worlds filled with entertaining characters and then setting players loose to be a part of that universe with overwatch that tradition continues wrapped in a pixaresque scifi wonderland filled with unique and interesting heroes and villains as fantastic as the overwatch universe is though little of the story unfolds over the course of the actual game outside of the game cinematic opening and some occasional inmatch dialogue between certain characters there not much character or plot development the characters don even have full backgrounds or expositions in the hero gallery just a short one or twoline bio synopsis customization options and a list of abilities to get the full overwatch experience you have to look outside the game to tieins like websites books animated shorts and morewhat overwatch lacks in story development it more than makes up for in gameplay each individual in the game strong roster feels like a complete and unique character plus by allowing even encouraging you to swap out characters midmatch overwatch gives you more than enough opportunity to find the heroes or villains that fit your particular style of play the basic controls are easy to pick up and learn but figuring out the best tactics to use both for your character and as a part of a team adds a layer of complexity that will take plenty of time to master there are plenty of reasons to keep coming back to overwatch as well outside of the main sixvssix multiplayer matches you can test your skills in the practice range or solo against aicontrolled heroes special events and limitedtime game modes occasionally add new rules to matches that guarantee to mix things up one week you might only be able to play as tank class characters and the next you might only be able to use headshots against the competition there no offline component to overwatch which means that to get the most out of the game players will need to group with others online the risk here is that online chat could expose players to toxic behavior and while players can mute troublesome players or abandon chat altogether communication between teammates does help considerably to coordinate strategiesfamilies can talk about violence in gaming is the impact of the violence in overwatch affected by the unrealistic visuals would the impact be intensified if the violence was more bloody or gory how does the violence in overwatch compare to that of other games in the same genre does the violence change the way you view the storyhow can strong communication skills help when

you be faced with on top of the personal journeys you play through there an overarching mystery at hand that affects not just the protagonists but the entire west at large every action has a consequence big or small with five lives on the line as well as the whole of the west will you solve the many mysteries the west has to offer and be a beacon of hope and humanity or will the west be lost foreveroftentimes games will push the feature of you can do whatever you want when the reality is much less expansive weird west holds no such false promises in this case the world is truly the player oyster the game sets the stage gives you enough tutorials so that you can get your bearings on the controls and mechanics and then firmly backs off and tells you to have fun there are the typical rpg roleplaying game features when it comes to upgrading your weapons and abilities or finding golden cards that will give you permanent benefits shared between characters but weird west truly shines in its ambitions and the way it realizes its lofty promises from the very beginning there nowhere on the map arbitrarily restricted from the player you can completely ignore the main objectives and go exploring potentially coming across offtrack side quests rare loot or even random events which keeps exploration fresh interesting and nerverackingin this world everything you do matters and has a purpose there are very few people you can condemn to an early grave and that goes for all characters relevant or not you may eliminate a series of quests by ending certain characters lives prematurely but rather than punish you the game takes a sure let roll with it approach and provides other options for you to explore to accomplish your goals without preventing you from making progress in the story the game encourages any and all play styles as well giving you the option stealth action or a combination of both you can choose to help people out of the kindness of your heart or demand payment for your generous assistance but keep in mind that weird west remembers and there may be a time when you regret crossing certain people or traveling down certain paths weird west is the perfect watercoolerconversation game where you can get together with friends and share whatever strange or unique happenings occurred during your playthrough as no two people will have exactly the same experiences what starts as a casual though morbid rootintootin cowboy story turns into something strange sinister and magical the freedom and diversity of choice will hook you but the compelling characters and world bizarre twists and turns and wholly unparalleled presentation will have you playing this game again and again just to see how differently things end up next timefamilies can talk about freedom of choice one of weird west strongest elements is there such a thing as giving a player too much freedom in a game or do games work best when there a set direction the player is expected to take to get the most out of the experience is it acceptable to make choices for other people what if you have the best of intentions which choices presented in weird west would be harder to make if it were you in the shoes of the characters you controlling and real lives were on the line whyhow well does the genre mashup of old west and dark fantasy work in weird west what are some other genre mashups in other games shows movies books or comics you can think of how well do they work or if not why don they work as well and what might make them better what genres would you like to see combined and what new stories could be told from them,en,485.0,Positive

saga is an action adventure game for the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs nintendo switch and windows pcs this is a cartoon fantasy adventure based on lego characters and the nine original star wars movies just like the films they based on there some violence like shooting laser pistols and wielding light sabers but enemies break into pieces and then disappear you can play as both heroes and villains in this game and the villains aren portrayed as being as bad as they are in the movies there some comic mischief too like seeing a stormtrooper underwear there are multiple versions of this game including a deluxe edition as well as downloadable content dlc available for purchasetwo of the biggest toy and movie franchises have fused once again in lego star wars the skywalker saga this actionadventure hybrid lets you play all nine of the original saga films in any order you like with more openended indoor and outdoor environments than in previous lego star wars games along with familiar locations planets moons spaceships bases and the ability to control several vehicles gamers can also play virtually all of the iconic heroes and villains from the scifi series be they human alien or droid there are literally hundreds each character has a unique weapon andor skill plus you need to build items to use or ride and swap characters in various situations to team up together the game also supports cooperative play on the same tv or computer monitor unraveling the larger story arc lego star wars the skywalker saga also has several sidequests and optional missions plus you can visit different locations even after finishing the main campaigns to collect goodies find secrets and unlock stud multipliers to help buy characters and further upgrades similar to its predecessors this game is meant to be funny too with plenty of sight gags oneliners and cutscene sequencesthis is an ambitious game that should more than satisfy fans of both star wars and lego franchises lego star wars the skywalker saga is fun hilarious accessible and packed with content that can take a very long time to fully experience but it not without its issues such as some repetitive and redundant missions an expansive universe that can be both exciting and boring depending on where you are and perhaps a deja vu experience for those who played previous lego star wars games there are also some bugs too which should be squashed soon still playing this is a blast while you can complete stories and visit locations in any order you start with episode iv a new hope playing as princess leia inside a spaceship is fun and you get a sense of the teamwork needed to complete missions but the real fun is when you land on tatooine and realize how much more open these worlds are compared to previous lego star wars games you can hop in a vehicle or run around on foot and explore the lands including running into sand people camps visiting stormtrooperrun areas and watching jawas go about their business it a blast for fans and the sense of freedom is refreshing a minimap shows where you are where you need to go and other important info so younger players shouldn be overwhelmed by these big areasthe main storylines and sidemissions all tie into a larger story arc but the openness of your options feels incredible speaking of the scope of the game there are about characters in total not including the seven dlc packs with extras like the mandalorian and rogue one a star wars story and more than collectible bricks and many other goodies to find but it true that some areas are less exciting especially when you need to travel for a while to get to where you going sometimes without a vehicle option plus some quests are more memorable than others there were also some issues with continuity and progression between the movie chapters that will supposedly be fixed with an update but the game free play mode is perfect once you complete the main story missions five per movie the cooperative coop option is fun on the same screen and works as smoothly as previous games in the franchise combat is better with two instead of one and many of the puzzles require some help finally lego star wars the skywalker saga is a greatlooking game played from a thirdperson view with highquality character models huge set pieces colorful lighting effects and silky smooth animation it sounds great too including great music crisp sound effects and impressive soundalike voice actors lego star wars the skywalker saga really is a great game for novice and seasoned players alike what it lacks in consistency it makes up for in ambition and does trade depth for breadth which is fine for the core age group of this titlefamilies can talk about family friendly gameplay do you feel like lego star wars the skywalker saga is appropriate for many kids to play by themselves is this something they should be able to play alongside a sibling or other family member or friend or something to play with a parent or guardian how does the coop mode emphasize cooperation to achieve goalsare parents ok if their kids play as villains like darth vader or emperor sidious in lego star wars the skywalker saga would it be odd if you couldn play as every main character good or bad,en,424.0,Positive

action adventure game exclusive to apple arcade this is the latest chapter in the longrunning castlevania franchise which has covered multiple games across a wide number of systems the game is focused on action and fantasy violence which plays a huge role in combat during play as the son of dracula and other characters you use swords whips and magic attacks to destroy supernatural enemies like giant beasts demons and skeletons there no blood or gore shown some female characters are shown to be wearing lowcut blouses or short skirtsthose who miss playing a new castlevania action game over the past many years have something new to sink their teeth into with castlevania grimoire of souls it virtually the same game as the shortlived game app which originally debuted for ios and android in but was discontinued in and then relaunched in the fall of for apple arcade but unlike the original game which featured advertisements and the option to buy ingame currency and support microtransactions this new version doesn offer this as part of the apple arcade service also the original game included a variety of single player and multiplayer modes coop and pvp while the new game is only a singleplayer experience but with weekly challenges and seasonal content castlevania grimoire of souls is a sidescrolling action game set in a gothic universe at first you play as alucard but eventually unlock others each with their own weapons and abilities and as the son of dracula a halfhuman half vampire must face off against various demons and other supernatural enemies to complete levels over levels for the main campaign the story is set after dracula has been sealed away alucard is shown the grimoires magical books which contain info on all the past events of castlevania and is asked to restore order to this growing dark power much of the game has you navigating levels by avoiding traps and using swords whips and magic to defeat enemies but there are also roleplaying elements such as a levelingup system earning ability points ap to upgrade abilities plus improving weapons subweapons equipment etc collecting magic orbs finding trunks full of useful items unlocking new quest paths and trials summoned objects and moreonly major fans of this gothic franchise will likely get a kick out of this refreshed mobile game packed with lore but castlevania grimoire of souls really doesn offer anything new in this genre and there quite a bit of repetition here in the sidescrolling action it attempts to offer a lot of depth in upgrade abilities bonus missions and challenge modes but eventually falls flat and gives you very little reason to log in day after day even though there are login bonus rewards after you go through a loadout screen of sorts you thrown into the action and move through mostly smallish levels not large set pieces to remain alive including traps avoid hits by enemies and so on it easier to use a controller yes even on an iphone and ipad but even touchscreen controls grow familiar after a while seasonal play which is broken up into various levels with quests related to those stages don break this monotony players can complete a quest making progress while facing tougher enemies adding even more of a challenge is the fact that you can change equipment once you begun a challenge and your characters hit points and magic points carry over into the next quest that makes collecting special coins to exchange for new weapons items or skins more importantcastlevania grimoire of souls isn a bad game and the developers had a lot of work to do to change it from a microtransactioncentric game to a platform that doesn allow for that they also had to balance the need to still grow the characters you play as work to get as much gear as possible and keep giving you a reason to return if you a fan of the series or have some nostalgia associated it and you already an apple arcade subscriber go ahead and spend an hour with this game to see if it gratifying enough for you but it certainly not worth buying a subscription for with better action games and experiences on apple arcade to be foundfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in castlevania grimoire of souls affected by the fact that you fighting a variety of monsters without blood or gore shown would the impact be intensified if there rere more realistic visuals what if you were fighting people instead of monstersdoes a game that part of a franchise make you more interested in checking out the other games in that series why or why

is a downloadable puzzleadventure game for windows mac and linux this mashupretelling of the classic stories the wizard of oz and little red riding hood follows scarlet an aspiring musician from kentucky after a concert that may change her life forever scarlet is whisked away by a tornado waking up in the fantasy land of glome which is populated with munchkins a green witch and ruby slippers in order to find her way home scarlet mission is to break free of a time loop that causing her to relive the same day over and over again with the help of some characters reminiscent of the scarecrow the tin man and the cowardly lion be prepared for cartoonish violence mild language crap occasional drinking by some characters to advance the story and character drawings that could be viewed as sexual in nature some content such as the inclusion of br wolf and fox and native american imagery could raise questions around cultural appropriation or be considered outright offensive but it can also be used to prompt discussion around the issues of the source materialin scarlet hood and the wicked wood players meet scarlet on the night of an important showcase for her band foxtrot bop despite a severe tornado watch scarlet rallies her bandmates leonard sammy and nick to push forward in their travels to the venue there following a successful performance scarlet meets with wicked records executive savannah who offers her a recording contract but the catch is that instead of signing the entire band wicked records only wants to work with scarlet aiming to pair her up with a trio already performing regularly in nashville when her friends find out they blame scarlet for not immediately rejecting the offer and scarlet is ostracized from the group while the others try to process their feelings on the ride back home the weather intensifies and as soon as she steps off the bus scarlet is whisked away by a tornado to the magical world of glome once scarlet wakes up she slowly pieces together that she not in kentucky anymore based on interactions with strange cave paintings rune puzzles and a talking fox she soon discovers a troupe of munchkins led by miss dixie who need a witch to escort them through the wicked wood to scarlets initial shock she outed as the witch in question by an ancient spell that places a red hood on her head and a broomlike whomping stick in her hand realizing that she doesn seem to have much choice scarlet agrees to lead the group though it not long before she and the munchkins run into lefaba the evil black witch and scarlet is killed by lefaba birdlike minions scarlet immediately awakens to the same scene she experienced a few hours prior with an unconcerned miss dixie telling her that the encounter was only a bad dream scarlet concludes that she stuck in a time loop fated to live the same day over and over until she able to break the spellat first glance this is an enjoyable adventure game but its reliance on fairy tales leads it into thorny issues of cultural appropriation and offensiveness though the narrative has familiar fairy tale elements there are enough amendments to scarlet hood and the wicked wood that the story feels new and fresh the writing is snappy and the puzzles are challenging and entertaining if just a bit repetitive the art style is beautiful and the design of the environments players must explore is engaging it easy to see how kids will be entertained even if they may be able to guess how the story is going to end though scarlet hood pulls from predictable fairy tale formulas it the shock and wonder portrayed by scarlet as she enters the world of glome that makes the story feel magical her personality and dialogue keep players invested of course we want to help this brave ambitious heroine get home safelybut as with other adaptations of outdated fairy tales there are some problematic elements that shouldn be ignored first the use of native american imagery such as headdresses and dreamcatchers is present throughout these don serve a narrative purpose and feel carelessly included also two animal characters br fox and br wolf are associated with african american oral traditions that have been appropriated by many racist films in the past such as disney infamous song of the south while it difficult to imagine that the developers in south korea included these images and references for any purposefully offensive reasons it raises important questions about the purpose that fairy tale adaptations may serve in modern times these elements in the game present opportunities for families to discuss where these images come from historically as well as when they appropriate to depict in media on a larger scale scarlet hood is an adaptation mostly of the american fantasy tale the wizard of oz while still a wildly popular film many decades after its release passionately racist writings from the story original author have been revealed in more recent years this has sparked debate among many arguing that as a result the wizard of oz should not still be so highly regarded or frequently shown this all begs the question what productive purpose does an adaptation of that story serve in the present day be prepared to lead open discussions about this and to educate yourselves and your kids about alternative options for kids who enjoy fantasy storiesfamilies can talk about sex gender and body image in video games why do you think both scarlet and savannah wear revealing clothing though they not explicitly portrayed as sexual beings or engaging in sexual activity is female nudity inherently sexual what makes people consider certain clothing choices such as garters and stockings or lowcut tops to be sexualwhy are certain fairy tales considered classics should those ideas ever be reexamined if so when how and whywhat is cultural appropriation is scarlet hood use of cultural artifacts from native american and black cultures appropriate why do you think the game developers made the choice to include them,en,486.0,Positive

action game for apple arcade this is the latest game based on star wars that has also gotten the lego treatment turning heroes and villains into minifigurines players can take on the role of the light side or the dark side of the force also known as the rebellion or the empire as they try to defeat their opponents in one versus one gameplay while players will use laser pistols lightsabers explosives flamethrowers and more against opponents no blood or gore is shown and defeated enemies fall apart into lego pieces placing your units and figures are simply done by drag and drop methods with the challenge resting on knowing which units best counter others players may also find themselves pitted against opponents that are vastly more powerful than they are making the gameplay more difficult than it needs to be otherwise there no inappropriate content to be foundlego star wars battles takes players to battlefields plucked from the entire saga of star wars movies to give them a chance to lead characters to victory against opponents in battles players will select from one of four randomly chosen units dragging and dropping them on the battlefield in land they control to advance towards enemy lines these troops fight on their own without player input causing destruction based on their abilities and attack strength this unit deployment leads to a tactical choice because while your energy regenerates over time you have to decide whether it worth it to flood the land with groups of weaker troops or do you choose to save up your energy and deploy a more powerful unit such as an atat or strafing run to launch destructive bombing raids on positions or troops if enough energy is stockpiled you can summon a champion to the field like yoda darth vader or luke skywalker each with their own unique abilities that can give them an edge against enemies but you also have to choose quickly because each battle is limited to two minutes and thirty seconds so a mistake can have significant consequences for your side as you advance you have the option to place towers and turrets to fortify your defense or claim more territory before you launch an attack on the enemy base each tower counts as a medal and is vital because if you survive till thirty seconds are left you prevented from building any more structures from there it an accelerated push to defeat the enemy or at least have more towers standing than they do at the end if you tied players are thrown into a sudden death battle where the next structure to fall grabs the win succeed and you gain experience points as well as scans of tokens that can be used to unlock additional units and upgrade their stats seasonal play as well as daily challenges are included to ensure that players will constantly make progress and boost their teams will you conquer the universe for the light or the dark side do or do not there is no try young padawan generalthis strategic action title puts a quirky amusing spin on battles with easy to grasp controls fastpaced action and lots of destructive fun one of the most engaging things about lego star wars battles is how simple it is to control as long as you can drag and drop a card from your hand onto the battlefield the game takes care of the rest sure there may be some instances where you mistakenly drop an aerial strike on your side because your finger lightly comes off the screen as you moving towards your target but with practice this is just an occasional mistake in the heat of battle what more impressive is just how fastpaced the gameplay feels without seeming completely out of control regardless of whether you choose to launch a squad of porgs at battle droids or you save up for gamorrean guards to smash through incoming attackers at your tower there no right or wrong way to deploy your troops unless you choose to leave one side completely open to counter attack even as things get faster and more energy is produced towards the end of the round to give you an accelerated push towards victory things feel firmly in control and hopefully like something you can turn the tide withthe big advantage of the shortened game rounds means that you can hop into a ton of battles and improve your teams with just fifteen or twenty minutes in your schedulethat does lead to one of the bigger negatives of the game as well though because you can quickly finish a game there are some players that have simply cranked through round after round with other players and are vastly more overpowered that you will be these fights aren particularly fair or fun because your best troops will frequently get shattered with only a few strikes from your opponent giving you the sense that you need to put in more work if you want to have a chance luckily these mismatches are few and far between meaning that you might find yourself saying just one more round to the minifig blasting mayhemfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in lego star wars battles affected by the lack of blood and gore included in the gameplay does the violence feel acceptable because characters simply break apart into lego bricks would it feel okay if there was more of a story included in the gameare you frustrated when you face off against clearly unfair odds is there still a way to be successful when things are not

initial character trait similar to rockpaperscissors along with boosting the attack and defense stats of each character spirits have their own skills and levels to determine how powerful they are

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/mlb-the-show-22,MLB The Show 22,parents need to know that mlb the show is a baseball simulation game for the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs and nintendo switch this is the latest chapter in the longrunning baseball franchise and after expanding for the first time to xbox systems last year it has expanded its reach to the nintendo switch this year as well crossplatform play returns with the option of the switch allowing gamers to take their progress on the go for game modes as long as they sync up their systems and info through a user account system on theshowcom players will need two separate copies of the game to also take advantage of this functionality as well players are presented with three overall playstyles and a range of difficulty settings including two new ones amateurs and minors virtually every aspect of the game can be further adjusted thanks to the wide number of sliders and options including dynamic difficulty levels baseball is still a challenging game where players will fail more than they will succeed so patience practice timing and luck is necessary to be successful for players on the switch they may want to rely on a pro controller over the joycon thumbsticks the pinpoint pitching option and stealing controls can put extra stress on a stick and the pitching requires precise movements the thumbsticks don always provide this accuracy no inappropriate content is included but there lots of product placement for topps major league baseball nike and other brands in stadiums or in stat boosting items found in card packs these items along with players stadiums and other extras can be purchased with real money or earned by playing through sessions in every game mode players could potentially be exposed to inappropriate comments in online games because they not moderatedmlb the show is the latest installment in the long running baseball franchise and this year it calling up another console to the major leagues by expanding to the nintendo switch for the first time that now means that players that own any game console can now play sony baseball simulation and thanks to the crossplay and crosssave functionality gamers can constantly make progress wherever they go as long as they create accounts and sync up their progress through the cloud that means playing on a console at home but having the opportunity to keep playing on the go as long as your switch has a wifi signal to upload or download your saved files to and from the cloud and you got subscriptions to online services for each platform while the three overarching playstyles of casual simulation and competitive return they bolstered by two additional difficulty levels amateur and minors providing a wider range of challenges to fit your baseball skills additionally in this year game the diamond dynasty mode has been revamped with new programs to help you build out your dream team that includes more than legends like ken griffey jr kirk gibson and mike mussina to take the field under your control there also a new mode called miniseasons where you pit your team against a condensed league of seven fictional teams to see if you be able to win a championship past that the mission structure has been revamped for team progress so simply playing games will boost your progress towards unlocking packs stadiums and gear user created players can be added to a diamond dynasty team as well as in the road to the show career mode where players will try to bring their athlete from the minors to a spot on a major league team roster this time around you have the option to create up to ten players with different positions ranging from pitchers to position players or twoway players with the story and commentary reflecting your choices road to the show also has new ingame cutscenes with legends and mlb sports analysts responding to the progress of your player making the story seem more tailored to your athlete journey to the pros finally this year features a new commentary team with jon boog sciambi and chris singleton taking over the booth to call the onfield action batter up because it baseball season and it time to head to the showthis year installment may not swing for the fences but its expansion to nintendo switch and refinement of gameplay lets it comfortably take extra bases technically mlb the show features a few refinements to gameplay modes that previously existed in last year play sanding off rough edges and adding a few new items here and there but it completes its expansion from sony systems by bringing in nintendo handheld to the fold while allowing crossplatform play crossplatform progression and cross saves it incredible to put in work on building your squad in diamond dynasty or grinding through a game series for road to the show on a console then transfer those files to the cloud and take them with you on the go without losing any progress the process does have hiccups when you setting things up to be aware of you have to create an account on the game website indicate a primary system you play on and sync any other device after the fact or any substantive progress that you made playing the game will appear to be erased fortunately it isn but the server confusion with the process can seem as though your work is gone until you get things straightened out another item that new switch players will want to be aware of is that the pro controller really is the best way to play the show simply because joycon thumbsticks aren great between the precise movements required for pinpoint pitching and the sharp movements for stealing bases joycon just don feel sturdy enough to stand up to the stress of the march to october much less a few of the miniseason matchups it also unfortunate that switch owners won have access to the stadium creator feature but maybe that can be added in for next year versionspeaking of the miniseasons this is an excellent addition to the diamond dynasty mode as you take your squad against seven other teams in an abbreviated game threeinning per game season before leading into the playoffs and eventual championship that not to cast doubt on the conquest or showdown portions of this mode they still included and still fun but miniseasons feels like a great way of pitting your squad against rival teams and also getting a sense of where you need to build or enhance your team while the energy for your pitchers seems to drain at an impossibly fast rate in this mode that tolerable when you consider how quick the gameplay happens to be it also factors into the refocused element of programs and progress where virtually everything you do from homeruns and strikeouts to simply getting on base winds up completing goals and earning you players packs or credits for the ingame store past this road to the show has chosen to not force players into selecting a twoway player which is more of a generational rarity than a standard talent anyway what nice is that the video clips from ben gellman and other mlb connected commentators for this year don feel as canned as last year sessions instead they feel more connected to actions you done and progress you made climbing from the minors to the major leagues and while there a new commentary crew there nothing fantastic or awful about the team of sciambi and singleton if you a fan of overexcited commentary you might miss the trio of vasgergian derosa and plesac but boog and chris do a solid job you still hear repeated dialogue a bit more than you like but it a more laid back conversational tone in their delivery overall mlb the show doesn reinvent the baseball game but it never had to it simply needed to refine what was there from last year and make the pastime more enjoyable which it easily manages to accomplish with its improved playfamilies can talk about consumerism do you feel pressured to spend your money on ingame packs in mlb the show to give your created baseball teams or players an advantage or would you rather earn new players by playing multiple baseball games do you feel like the option to take your game progress with you for crossplatform play is worth buying the game twicedoes playing this game make you interested in playing or watching baseball in real life what about learning about classic moments of the sport do some of the modes get you interested in fantasy baseball drafts could it make someone who isn a fan of baseball become a fan of the

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/black-book,Black Book,parents need to know that black book is a downloadable strategic deckbuilding game for the playstation xbox one nintendo switch and windows pcs the game has a story built from slavic mythology following the death of her fiance a young woman named vasilisa longs to rescue his soul from the underworld in order to do this she must engage in the ritual to become a witch and unlock the power of a magical book that can grant any wish gameplay includes strategic card battles and tasks to help people in neighboring villages dealing with demons who cause anything from small inconveniences to terrible tragedies while there a brief discussion of romantic relationships nothing explicit is talked about and similarly mentions of hell are frequent but are required for the explanation of scenarios and story points while there some blood effects from card battles and mentions of suicide in the dialogue there nothing overtly gory or scary shown within playwhen a young man commits suicide his betrothed bride swears to use the magical black book in order to save his soul so with the help of her adoptive grandfather aptly named old egor vasilisa becomes a witch in order to harness the books power to do this she must fight powerful demons which correspond to unlocking seven seals on the books cover the catch is that in her culture being a witch or koldun as the game often refers to vasilisa using this traditional term is a tough job meaning that vasilisa wont be able to simply focus on her original goal a key responsibility that comes along with being a knower which is another traditional slavic term used for sorcerers is maintaining chorts or familiarlike demons who must cause some form of mischief which vasilisa can assign daily if the chorts dont have a job they will use their evil energy on the koldun who should be managing them chipping away at their health bar the second key responsibility vasilisa now has is doing favors for villagers who do not have the power to manage the demons who trouble their lives each favor leads vasilisa into a chapterlike storyline eventually allowing her to become strong enough to fight the next demon controlling one of the black books seals though black book contains strategic card battles a great deal of the players focus is actually on reading collected encyclopedia entries and short fables in order to make culturallyinformed dialogue choices which are rewarded by a point system allowing vasilisa to upgrade her combat skills though black book is overall a dark title with a bleak tone there joy to be found for players interested in learning about mythology and historythis title doesnt try to be a history lesson but it does a fantastic job of blending classic deckbuilding strategy mechanics into a fictional but overall historically accurate world its easy to forget that so many of our presentday stories are pulled from the same traditional roots and black book is a muchneeded reminder of where these beloved stories of magic and fantasy come from this comes to life ingame in small ways such as the frequent use of traditional russian words used in conjunction with english dialogue throughout the story if a player forgets the meaning of the word they can easily scroll over it to get a definition no matter how many times it already shown up this subtly encourages players to actually remember these words which many may never pursue learning on their own elements like this seamlessly integrate this careful research into a very entertaining storyanother unique element is the collection of encyclopedia entries and bailichkas which are short fables that vasilisa encounters throughout the story vasilisa needs to use the information learned from these pieces of information to directly make choices about what to say ingame there are clear right and wrong answers and the challenge is to apply the information in the book to whats being asked of vasilisa during ingame events while the need to attentively read through the encyclopedia isnt burdensome its tough to resist the urge to google unfamiliar terms instead of searching for them in the book while this isnt a flaw in the gameplay but simply a preference in play style its worth mentioning that players who may lean towards only the deckbuilding strategy may get the feeling theyre spending too much time in the library nevertheless black book is rather ambitious for committing to include so much history in the first place and it would be difficult to argue against its success as one of the most immersive deckbuilding games everfamilies can talk about morality in black boo players are rewarded equally though on two different point systems for actions considered good and actions considered bad even though there are no other tangible effects of these sins or good deeds ingame so how is this different from real life can you think about a time you experienced a good or bad consequence as a result of something you didin black book mythology and religion shape the entire world around vasilisa and old egor but what are some other examples of cultures throughout history that have been highly influenced by mythology and religion how can we compare and contrast cultures that are shaped by the same influences,en,417.0,Positive
commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/wolfstride,Wolfstride,parents need to know that wolfstride is a downloadable roleplaying adventure game available on windows and macintosh operating systems it takes place in a world where giant robot combat has become a global sporting phenomenon players help arrange and participate in these mech fights while exploring rain city where the protagonists currently live the game features extensive profanity from the very start of the tutorial until the closing lines of the ending violence occurs regularly but most is cartoonish fights between large robots occasionally character deaths are represented onscreen and those are accompanied by more graphic images and slight gore alcohol and tobacco are used and mentioned frequently the protagonist is always depicted as smoking a cigarette and several characters are shown drinking to the point of excesswolfstride has the player take control of dominic shade a former criminal who trying to help his friends participate in a global mechcombat sporting competition shade helps arrange the fights repair and upgrade the robot and does odd jobs for citizens of rain city to pay for it all as the story progresses shade helps his team rise through the ranks of the ultimate golden god tournament as darker conspiracies unravel around him players get to know the residents of rain city while exploring which is often accompanied by fast paced minigames when shade is able to arrange each fight the other playable character knife leopard pilots their mech called cowboy to victory over other professional mech arena pilots players use various skills and strategies to defeat these mechs in a turnbased rpg roleplaying game combat system that takes place on a plane along several allocated tiles players choose from close range and long range attack skills defensive and utility skills and carefully determine how to maneuver cowboy in each game turn in between fights players can customize cowboy and knife leopard with a number of upgrades and skills to tailor the experience of mech fighting to their own tastesthis slicklypresented indie rpg roleplaying game tries to be many things at once and it fails as often as it succeeds visually wolfstride is consistently appealing despite being almost entirely grayscale the character portraits animated mechs and pixel art are all distinct and present an outstanding visual look the music and sound design are also charming creating a westernmovie atmosphere for rain city where things begin to fall apart is the writing particularly the dialogue wolfstride feels like its trying to be edgy wholesome and profound at the same time and the dialogue just can keep up with those demands profanity is constant but doesn feel particularly impactful or worldbuilding it just there to be part of the aesthetic but it doesn really add to anything despite all of the juvenile humor wolfstride also tries to have profound monologues and ominous narration unfortunately these often felt overwrought and cheesy and towards the end of the game these moments went on for far too long none of this is helped by the inconsistent voice acting which was especially distracting with some of the npcs nonplayer characters that said there still good to be found in the writing because some characters are charming and you get to spend a lot of time helping them with their problems the best moments tend to be when the game takes a step back and just has you hang out with the rest of the cowboy crewthe other key element is the mech combat and there fun to be found there you given a number of customization options fairly early on and you can tinker with your build to help play the way you want to between positioning skill selection and mech customization there just enough strategy to each match that players will feel consistently engaged trying to find the best way to solve the combat puzzle that the other mechs provide this diminishes a bit towards the end where the upgrade options are less plentiful but your mech remains very powerful there are strings of fights here where the same strategy will carry you through without needing to change anything up ultimately taking control of the cowboy remains pretty fun and its used sparingly enough that it stays exciting for most of the run of the game wolfstride has issues but there a level of heart put into everything about the game that hard to ignore if you can look past the repitition and the questionable writing there a lot of charm to be found in wolfstridefamilies can talk about the presence of alcohol and tobacco in media how does watching characters you control drinking and smoking make you feel how does this compare to depictions of drugs and alcohol in other media does playing the character make it less acceptable than if it was a television showhow does explicit language make you feel does a character swearing seem more believable or relatable does it change the way children should view the characters as potential role models,en,394.0,Positive

the nintendo switch players take on the role of a young lord and his group of friends struggling to keep his lands from being devastated by war from rival territories unfortunately this means that they take on a significant number of opponents all of whom want to eliminate them as potential threats to their schemes players will frequently engage in battles with armies of varying strengths using magic ranged weapons swords and more to eliminate their opponents aside from specific story moments which show characters dying and bleeding enemies disappear when defeated players may hear some sexual innuendo and some occasional profanity including bastard damn and ass one character is also shown drunk after having too much to drink at a celebrationtriangle strategy is a strategy roleplaying game rpg that takes place on the continent of norzelia after a huge campaign known as the saltiron war pitted the three kingdoms of the region glenbrook aesfrost and hyzante against each other for scarce resources a tentative truce was formed to put an end to the conflict the game takes place thirty years after the events of the war and puts players in the shoes of lord serenoa heir to the glenbrook noble house of wolfort serenoa is engaged to an aesfrosti princess named frederica as a way to tie their two nations closer together and ensure that peace is maintained across the land unfortunately for them they clearly pawns in a game of political intrigue one that engulfs the land in a new conflict and forces the pair along with their friends and allies to fight for their lives gameplay is split into two separate phases one where you develop your characters advancing the plot recruiting new allies to your side and deciding which tactics you use along the way players will have the option to affect serenoa worldview thanks to one of three convictions utility morality or liberty these choices will also affect how party members respond to serenoa during some plot moments these party members will offer their opinions and vote on the course that the group should take depending on your decisions and the info you gathered you be able to sway their opinion to your side the second phase is tactical combat where players will deploy their forces and attempt to achieve objectives without their forces being overwhelmed sometimes this will involve reaching checkpoints while others will require eliminating all enemy forces there are plenty of strategic elements to consider such as opponent weaknesses or whether you have high ground which will add distance and power to launched arrows players can even cause additional damage by striking a unit from behind or combo attacks by surrounding enemies will serenoa and his friends survive the chaos of war or will they be the next norzelian casualtiesthis strategy title merges tactical combat and political intrigue which will appeal to a number of rpg fans without spoiling the story triangle strategy has a plot that feels ripped from a song of fire and ice with arranged marriages court betrayals murders and more driving the plot players can explore a main chapter story point or a possible side tale to gain a new character or learn more about a party member background along the way there are moments where you be able to select between three conversational choices to adjust serenoa personal convictions these in turn impact your allies and can directly change or manipulate the way that they vote for key plot points to fully understand every side of the story you need to replay the game several times but there are some issues here the choices themselves aren visually aligned to a specific conviction system so when a menu pop up simply says that your convictions are strengthened you have no idea what direction you leading your character further many of the events of the story are already set in motion so while you may make important decisions you often on the sideline watching the plot unfold you just wish that there was more you could do to explore the lives of these characters in these extreme circumstancesfortunately the tactical strategy in battle makes up for the story rough spots players can take advantage of elevated ground to cause additional damage from a distance funnel enemies into narrow pathways and blast them with magic or immobilize targets with status effects units can also be strategically positioned to backstab enemies for more painful strikes or to bounce targets between two teammates for combo attacks completing these tactical blows will earn you points to use for special moves like recovering a unit health automatically or skipping enemy turns in favor of your own it might not be as deep as other tactical titles like fire emblem three houses but the fights require planning and careful placement of units to be successful you also need to invest in grinding through battles to strengthen your troops because missions will test your squads with more challenging units that will easily wipe out weaker troops if you can look past the story hiccups triangle strategy will test your tactical skills for quite some timefamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in triangle strategy affected by the lack of blood and gore in most fights does the inclusion of blood and bodies for pivotal story moments feel more jarring when it includedtriangle strategy rewards cautious tactical planning in combat but is this the right way to play the game should you use these tactics in

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/humankind,Humankind,parents need to know that humankind is a downloadable strategic nationbuilding game available for microsoft windows macos and google stadia the basic structure of humankind is similar to other strategy simulation games asking players to use a certain number of movement points to travel across a game board with hexagonal tiles players can then choose where to develop their first city and begin collecting money growing population and researching technologies the goal is to gain the most fame points throughout the course of the game and these can be gained through any type of cultural innovation whether that be scientific political economic or militaristic though there combat in the game in the form of topdown views of armies battling each other there no blood or gore otherwise there no inappropriate contenthumankind guides players through six eras of history all with their own challenges and possible achievements every society starts as a mycenaean huntergatherer tribe in the neolithic era and players can advance to the next era by collecting fame influence or science points or by gaining food and building materials from the world around them depending upon how successful each player is as well as the length and difficulty chosen during that game players may only make it as far as the medieval or industrial era instead of all the way into the modern era the way to advance is by collecting stars which players can get by building a certain number of districts in their cities researching a certain number of technological innovations defeating a certain number of enemy units in battle or by staking a claim in a certain number of territories during each era players can choose whether to keep their current cultural influence which always comes with bonuses and modifiers or choose a new one from a list of cultures that were dominant during that era in real lifethe experience is the same across all versions although the google stadia version of the game has some exclusive features like state share allowing other players to hop into your game world from the first turn and compete against your civilization accomplishments and a direct touch feature that allows android mobile phones to act as controllers if you don have one handythis fantastic strategy game builds on classic titles and creates unique experiences that fans will love to explore obvious comparisons are being made between humankind and sid meier civilization vi both are played on a hexagonal game board asking players to expand their nation over time as well as communicate effectively with surrounding leaders and enemies while there are rather minor differences between combat and map structure between the two the biggest difference is the opportunity to build a culture piece by piece which is only possible in humankind the civic system is totally unique in this case and it completely changes the gameplay instead of creating a strategy and sticking with it throughout the ages humankind gives players the opportunity to switch their strategy from era to era for instance a society may start out as a more militaristic one when their view of the map only contains one hostile neighbor but it may become more concerned with naval trade when territory on an ocean is claimed in a later era and discovery of friendly allies across the sea is madethis freedom to constantly make changes is very exciting and it forces players to be more open to all of their options for growth over time as their focus could change at any moment still it tough to judge whether this key feature is enough to encourage hardcore fans of the civilization series that this title is a mustplay though it exciting for your culture to change over time it can get overwhelming if too many other players whether reallife friends or computer ai are switching their strategies every era as well as far as the stadia exclusive features state share is very cool it lets people take a screenshot or video clip of their game and anyone can instantly click on that asset and launch into that created world it a cool concept that a whole new twist on save games and it works incredibly well direct touch on the other hand is an interesting idea for android phones especially if you happen to be on the go and away from a computer without a controller although it does take some getting used to when it comes to using multiple fingers to cancle actions or access menus the biggest issue though is that you ruin your eyes trying to read through all of the text on your phones screen while you tapping away to direct your civilization but in the end the concern about being overwhelmed by choices and options comes down to personal preference and outside of comparisons to other games humankind is a fantastic experience on its ownfamilies can talk about the different ways that societies gain fame over time what are some examples and what does the history of your nation look like why might a society want to change over timethough each society can choose how they want to gain fame what are some examples of things that all societies need in order to be successful does that seem more or less effective for certain societies within humankind,en,395.0,Positive

an artistic achievement for mature players while life is strange true colors stands on its own it part of a popular and acclaimed franchise the original game life is strange was released in and has become a cult favorite this story doesn directly connect with the events of the first aside from one crossover character steph is originally seen in life is strange before the storm and a few subtle references hidden in some of the game locations despite this the relationship that lis true colors has with the rest of the franchise is palpable usually players aren asking for more of the same when

do choices matter adventure games better than anyone elsethe environment designs show exceptional attention to detail that makes all the difference the designers expertly uses spaces like apartments

characters immediately the balance between a breathtaking setting and its underlying darkness provides the narrative with an emotionally rich backdrop as early as the opening scene the game paints a starkly beautiful picture of how trauma and pain can coexist with joy and healing some choices presented may seem inconsequential in the moment but others are clearly uncomfortable and difficult to deal with while this may be a helpful tool for teenagers making sense of complicated emotions such as grief loneliness and betrayal for the first time in their lives it equally relevant for mature players to be reminded of the people and adventures that make living through this trauma and pain so worth it this may sound vague but some experiences are best firsthand and this is one of them overall existing fans of life is strange will see true colors as a mustplay all of what made life is strange a huge success feels emotionally present but this is also a totally new story with a singular tone setting and cast new fans will likely also be captivated as lis true colors continues in the path of its predecessors to challenge the depth of emotions that video games as a medium are

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land,Kirby and the Forgotten Land,parents need to know that kirby and the forgotten land is an adventure game exclusively for the nintendo switch this is the chapter in the kirby franchise which has been featured in various other games and has inspired other titles toys and other media players explore a variety of worlds as kirby or in coop play along with banana waddle dee in an attempt to rescue captured waddle dees players can use amiibos that are sold separately to gain coins powerups and other items while players are frequently attacking creatures and other opponents with swords hammers pistols and more no blood or gore is shown and defeated enemies disappear in a flash of smoke light and stars otherwise there no inappropriate content what is highlighted though is the persistence and constant drive by kirby to help others in unfortunate circumstances and the lengths he stretch his puffy body to so that he can defeat evil and save the daykirby and the forgotten land starts one day as kirby is happily exploring his world only to find himself and his friends sucked into a mysterious storm that appears out of nowhere while everyone attempts to flee the storm is far too strong and swallows them all up depositing them in a strange new land for some reason this location is full of ruined buildings abandoned equipment and hostile creatures that capture every waddle dee they can find placing them all in cages kirby leaps into action but only manages initially to save banana waddle dee a spear wielding friend and an odd creature named elfilin who advises the pink blob on what to do and where to go in singleplayer stages gamers will direct kirby across a wide variety of levels as he attempts to free the captured waddle dees bringing them back to their village so that they can rebuild and restore their lives kirby will also attempt to fend off attacks from a group of characters known as the beast pack thanks to his ability to swallow objects or enemies to absorb and copy their powers that means that by inhaling hammers pistols swords and other items kirby gains new skills that he can use against his opponents in battle but kirby will also be able to swallow items like cars parking cones and fallen signs turning them into new weapons against opponents players can team up with a friend taking on the part of banana waddle dee to clear levels together what mysteries lie in this new land and can you save the kidnapped waddle dees before it too latethis accessible adventure will make you smile but the additional gameplay challenges and hidden extras will keep you coming back for more the true appeal of kirby and the forgotten land is finding all of the secrets buried in each stage discovering hidden waddle dees are standard objectives in every level but you can also perform tasks along the way like knocking down wanted posters or staying out of sludge to rescue additional citizens each dee that you save and each goal that you complete helps you rebuild waddle dee town giving the captured creatures a place to live in return their buildings give you access to minigames statues shops and powerups that constantly provides motivation to explore and replay levels especially as you gain new abilities each copy ability has a standard attack and a poweredup strike with enough coins and stars earned from minigames these can be evolved into stronger versions providing new tactics that can be used in a stage in fact there are some level goals you can even accomplish without specific skills so there loads to do and plenty of things to unlock whether you playing alone or wandering the world in coop play exploring ruins like abandoned shopping malls is a ton of fun as you hop jump and blast throughnotable hiccups during play don ruin the game but do detract from the action for example forgotten land isn very hard to play through by yourself and it becomes easier with coop since one player can draw fire while the other takes out or injures opponents unless you have trouble coordinating with your partner you should be able to sail through the stages additionally while you gather figurines during stages and from the ingame ball machine the use of actual amiibos for gameplay is underwhelming tapping one usually results in coins fruit and the occasional powerup depending on the figure if instead they provided a substantial boost to a copied ability or an invincibility powerup it would feel more useful than decorative instead it seems like a missed opportunity that being said though kirby and the forgotten land is a lot of fun and adventure fans young and old alike will love exploring its worldfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in kirby and the forgotten land affected by the lack of blood and gore in the game is the violence acceptable because it cartoonish and laughable that a character could inhale an opponent and spit them outdo you feel the need to buy amiibo to access some of the hidden features of kirby and the forgotten land does the inclusion of this feature add to the gameplay or is it simply being used to sell figurines,en,412.0,Positive

playstation xbox one and xbox series xs this is the latest chapter in the longrunning baseball franchise and for the first time it expanded from its exclusivity on sony systems to include players on microsoft machines as well players are presented with three initial difficulty levels which can be further customized with a suite of sliders and options even with the flexibility in the customization the gameplay will still require lots of practice timing and luck to be successful during a match especially if you happen to be playing an online opponent further the latest addition to the control scheme requires pinpoint accuracy with analog sticks which could potentially frustrate some players without significant dedication to mastering its elements no inappropriate content is included but there lots of product placement for topps major league baseball chevrolet and other brands in stadiums or in stat boosting items found in card packs these items along with players stadiums and other extras can be purchased with real money or earned by playing through sessions in every game mode players could potentially be exposed to inappropriate comments in online games because they not moderatedmlb the show is the latest installment in the popular baseball franchise but this year the game has grown from its exclusive status as a playstationonly title to swing for the fences on xbox systems as well it brings with it a number of gameplay enhancements to fully take advantage of its expansion across systems including crossplatform play so friends can find and play each other regardless of the system they have the game has refined the difficulty into three levels casual simulation and competitive all of which can be tweaked with various ingame sliders to fit your skills similarly players have the option to choose the control scheme for each moment in the field such as baserunning pitching or catching new to this year game is pinpoint pitching an enhanced analog stickdriven scheme that lets you directly influence the speed timing and direction of a pitch as it heads toward the plate regardless of the controls you choose you can select a different option at any time and each mode comes with thorough tutorials also for the first time in the franchise history players can now create new stadiums all of the game modes from last year have made a return with a few notable adjustments road to the show the createaplayer career mode casts gamers as an upandcoming twoway player one that can pitch and hit as well as field the ball hoping to make their way from the minor leagues to a major league team along the way there are media clips from mlb network personalities commenting on your athlete progress or regression which feel like running segments on a sports show these players aren restricted to this mode because you can also import them into your diamond dynasty team which is your fantasy squad of current and classic ball players letting you see just how well your athlete would fare against the greats of america pastime diamond dynasty has also adjusted the challenges provided across this massive mode giving you more game situations from classic baseball to meet or exceed allowing you to earn new players stadiums gear and more rounding out some of the game enhancements are new batting and fielding animations boosts to the ai in how to attempt to rob home runs from going over the fence or to play balls that bounce off the wall to cut off an extra base and sharper graphics to take advantage of the hardware of the new systemswhile it isn a massive step forward for the franchise as a whole the expansion to the xbox ensures that a new generation of baseball fans can enjoy this homage to america pastime one of the biggest and most notable differences from previous years is that mlb the show is now available for players on microsoft system with crossplay meaning that fans can enjoy the best baseball title regardless of the system they playing on that a huge bonus it brings in a lot of excitement to online play and demonstrates just how massive this franchise is among sports video games it also nice to see that for these newcomers and even for veterans there a significant amount of tutorials and info to help bring them along whether it explaining a game mode or going over the ins and outs of the various control schemes of the game speaking of it clear that the new pinpoint pitching system is a clever concept to give players tighter control over the speed timing and direction of a ball hurled at the plate but in practice it much harder to effectively locate your pitches without putting in a ton of work on the sticks not only do you have to choose where you want the ball to go but you have to be extremely precise with your analog stick movement to be successful not too fast and not too far off the drawn indicator line or you have a wild pitch out of your hands if you not willing to put in the work on this you may want to choose a different setupmove past the controls and you have much of the same rocksolid gameplay as previous years the new animations deserve a callout because it a lot of fun to watch players slam their bat in frustration when they hit a pop fly during a clutch situation or see outfielders scale the wall and rob someone from going yard beyond that road to the show gets a new twist with the focus being on your created athlete as a twoway player able to pitch and hit and possibly be a good fielder it up to you to decide if you want to keep this distinction as you try to make your way from the minor leagues to the show or if you dedicate yourself to one position only while it nice to see the addition of mlb network analysts like cliff floyd jim callis jonathan mayo and others talking about your player successes or failures in video clips these sometimes feel like they scripted to happen at set moments instead of being specific to what you just done it also feels a bit lighter because the same issues from last year remain but the focus on rivalries has been removed perhaps that because there a bigger drive to push players into the diamond dynasty mode to enhance and unlock new gear for road to the show along with unlocking fantasy athletes and stadiums while you can earn content by playing games it hard not to feel a slight push to pay for ingame currency if you going to play and compete in some showdown matches for bigger packs and rewards again mlb the show may not be a home run but it definitely hits for extra bases with its solid gameplay across multiple systemsfamilies can talk about consumerism do you feel pressured to spend your money on ingame packs in mlb the show to give your created baseball teams or players an advantage or would you rather earn new players by playing multiple baseball gamesdoes playing this game make you interested in playing or watching baseball in real life what about learning about classic moments of the sport do some of the modes get you interested in fantasy baseball drafts could it make someone who isn a fan of baseball become a fan of the sportwhy do you think that this is the first time that mlb the show as a franchise has expanded to multiple platforms is this merely a business decision or is it to get more fans of baseball interested in playing a popular game,en,491.0,Positive

from altruism assertiveness and bravery to laziness cruelty and deception though most are concerned with the best interests of their friends family and the empire play encourages kids to think before acting as they realize that their actions have irreversible consequences both in terms of how the story unfolds and which of the heroes make it through one battle to fight in the next the game has also released optional downloadable content dlc which has included new costumes new game modes and even a fourth group of students to interact with and command on the battlefieldfire emblem three houses brings the longrunning tactical turnbased roleplaying game series to switch it puts players in the armor of a mysterious young man or woman players get to select gender who takes on the role of a professor at a military academy located in an ancient monastery at a time when mysterious events are taking place across the churchrun empire he or she becomes the leader of one of the academy

including new costumes missions and even a fourth mystery house as a side quest which has an impact on the main storythose who played previous games in this beloved series know what they in for here chesslike tactics with decisions that can have gamechanging consequences fire emblem three houses delivers all of this and plenty more there much more dialogue and character development here than in previous fire emblem games with players able to spend an hour or more running around the monastery between battles as they talk to and teach students fulfill quest requirements and carry out tasks that include gardening fishing cooking and hosting tea parties there also more opportunity to practice combat and grind levels thanks to a variety of quest battles prologue missions and monster routing assignments that come available every week expect to sink scores of hours into this one more if you choose to replay as each of the two houses you didn initially pick each comes with its own

fighters in their own right discovering why these characters are below the monastery is an interesting tale and it handled as a side quest so you can complete it and recruit these students to your main game unlocking new quests and story elements along the waysome other changes in this bigger and more ambitious entry might not sit as well with certain players though the optional permadeath feature returns it doesn have the same significance as in previous games rather than disappearing completely from the story defeated characters are placed on a permanent disabled list of sorts rather than outright killed they can often still be seen and interacted with in and around the monastery plus a new time rewinding feature means players can revert to a previous turn to avoid the deaths of particularly beloved heroes and while the expanded array of activities between battles is interesting at first it can get repetitive as players feel the need to obsessively seek out everyone to return lost items they found and see if they got anything new or interesting to say fire emblem three houses is a good addition to the series and it makes great use of the switch hardware for improved graphics and onthego play but franchise traditionalists may find themselves wishing for a return to its hardcore rootsfamilies can talk about screen time in fire emblem three houses tasks tend to overlap and lead seamlessly into each other making it hard to quit playing so how do you decide when it time to stop playing a gamenot every problem has a clear solution and once a choice is made it can be hard or impossible to take back so how do you feel confident about making and then living with the results of difficult decisions even if things don turn out as you like or

game offered on newer platforms and that it depicts antisocial behavior and violence within a school environment at its heart it is a simulation about bullying behavior in a school setting and therefore given the sad state of school violence a hotbutton topic for parents there is plenty of psychological mischief and physical violence including fistfighting kicking humiliating taunts and insults weapons include a slingshot firecracker launcher baseball bat garbage can lid and fire extinguisher but there are no guns or bombs nor is there any gore serious injuries or deaths the wii edition makes use of the console motion sensitive controls to punch but doesn make players engage in the physical act of punching the game contains some sexual remarks sexual pranks stealing girls underwear and sneaking into a bathroom to try to get a photo of a girl in the shower all you see is steam and alcohol references and depending on the path taken the main character jimmy hopkins can kiss another boy pranks include pushing kids into toilets tossing stinkbombs firecrackers and itching powder at pedestrians and throwing marbles on the ground for others to trip over the game does include consequences for misdeedsan update of the original playstation game bully scholarship edition is in essence a high school simulation game that puts players in the shoes of teenager jimmy hopkins after being dropped off at a new boarding school by his abusive mother and stepfather he immediately targeted as an outcast by several school cliques he has two choices succumb to bullying and beatings or stand up for himself and other students who are victimized by these hooligans sometimes the decision is left up to the player but there are many instances in which jimmy hand is forced and he compelled to fight back however he can be it in the form of a stealth attack with his slingshot or a bit of revenge by breaking into a bully locker make no mistake bully is filled with plenty of antisocial behavior but it also manages to act as a reflection albeit a sensationalized one of what life is like at some rough and tumble schoolsthanks to the game wide gamut of bullying behavior both physical fistfights and psychological taunts insults and humiliation some parents will be tempted to ban bully on principle but in the end there little here that most teens won witness at some point in their daytoday school lives in fact standing up to these video game bullies might even prove somewhat cathartic for kids who suffer bullying in their real lives yes billy uses excessive violence to accomplish many of his objectives but he never goes too farthere are no guns bombs deaths or serious injuries in the game and he does end up accomplishing plenty of good by the time the game credits roll there peace at bullworth academy all of the school cliques are friends with one another and the game most immoral characters have been suitably punished the main bully is expelled and a perverted and abusive teacher is fired of course players are free to experiment outside the narrative and start bullying innocents but there are consequences to these actionssuch as being busted by everpresent school prefects losing mission progress and being forced back to class to play learning minigamesjust keep in mind that bully isn a game intended for younger kids while most teens will be able to handle the game events younger kids aren prepared to deal with some of the psychological bombshells this game unleashes prominent among the high jinx are missions that see the player going on a panty raid for a perverted teacher shoving an occupied outhouse down a hill and taking a picture of a bathroom in which a girl is taking a shower though all we see is steam it also worth noting that thanks in part to the game spoton high school humor and surprisingly engaging story many gaming parents might want to check bully out especially those who remember having been on the receiving end of many a high school prank and who wouldn mind a little fantasy paybackfamilies can talk about the fact that in real life anyone who acts the way these kids act will be tossed out of school they can also talk through how to deal with bullies in the real world should you walk away as you can in the game or fight back to show them you not scared you can do this too the game also lets you stand up for the nerds in front of the bullies you may want to discuss how pranks and other mischief can hurt or harm others families could also discuss whether the game provides a moral compass if you try to be a good person in a world full of bullies are you rewarded the game could also prove an excellent launch pad for a discussion about violence in your children school you might ask your kids what they have heard and seen and how it makes them feel you can ask why they want to play a game that simulates rough behavior when bullying is a real part of daily life does it help them cope or give vicarious

while others are more complex such as working on the electrical systems on your vessel all of this would be fine except that there at least one imposter in the crew who working against your better goals actively sabotaging systems sneaking through vents and killing off the crew one by one as soon as a body is detected or someone notices suspicious behavior or the impostor wants to sow confusion players can call an emergency meeting to discuss who they think is guilty and why if players get enough votes that person is ejected into space or lava and their motivations are revealed if the crew can discover the impostors they win if the imposters can frame the crew or kill them all off by murder or sabotage the impostors win players can participate via local wifi or online or practice their skills and sneaking in a freeplay mode there also crossplay between computers and ios and android devices so people on various systems can play each otherdeception deduction confusion and humor go hand in hand with this party game set in space where the person next to you could be key to your survival or willing to stab you in the back there no plot in among us other than trying to complete your tasks and uncover the impostors hidden in the crew who are more than willing to sabotage your equipment and murder everyone to accomplish their goals it the drama that springs from trying to deduce who the killers are that captivating did you see someone murder another crew member why is that person hanging out in that room was it to accomplish a task or were they pretending to while sabotaging something these questions and more will pop up as you run through the halls until someone calls an emergency meeting to accuse someone of acting sus game lingo for suspicious or because they found a body at that point everyone can chat to explain where they were and who they think did it if you have an alibi or are a better liar who can divert attention from yourself you may stick around for the next round if not you get ejected into space or tossed into lava the bartering and excuses that people come up with during these meetings are not only an incredible glimpse into the minds of fellow players but also where the action shines watching alliances suddenly form and fracture as people accuse others and defend their actions and the game excels with a full complement of players and multiple imposters because it calls into question everything you think you know about people especially if the character you swore was guilty turns out to be innocentvisually the gameplay is cartoonish which is nice when you consider how ghoulish the actions are that you or your fellow players can commit blowing up a reactor or eliminating oxygen are just some of the ways you can kill players apart from directly getting your hands dirty but aside from the limited gore the game is easy to learn how to play within minutes and depending on who you playing with matches are quick affairs running minutes or less some of the minigames to complete tasks range from simple to difficult which is good because it raises suspicion depending on how long it takes to complete the downside though is that once you finish all of the tasks for a stage no new ones are issued apart from stopping sabotages which makes the action devolve into either a waiting game for the next murder or a bunch of rampant accusations out of boredom the other issue the game isn always stable games crash frequently matches that appear open are magically filled and wins sometimes happen without players doing a thing but these glitches aside among us is a surprisingly fun chaotic deduction game that keeps you coming back to find a murderer or to commit mayhem round after roundfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in among us increased since you are actively hunting and murdering players if you the impostor is the impact lessened by the cartoonish nature of the visuals even though bodies are left behindwhy is it important to tell the truth in games like among us when is it important to lie to accomplish your goals in a game that relies upon deception is it ok to have a game that relies upon deception at the core of its gameplay,en,402.0,Positive
commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nba-2k22,NBA 2K22,parents need to know that nba is a basketball simulation for the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs and windows pcs this is the latest installment in the longrunning and globally popular sports franchise that tries to present a complete version of the sport from the developmental leagues to the wnba and the nba whether you on the court or in the front offices there no offensive content to be found in the game although unmoderated online play can expose gamers to inappropriate comments the large amount of branding from previous years is even more significant in nba with billboards for ruffles sour patch kids mobil and more stores for adidas nike new balance and more are prominently featured in a mall with the option to display clothing on a catwalk in the city for a fashion show the commercial character jake from state farm also makes an appearance not only providing missions to players but giving state farmbranded clothing for players to wear and show off as they move through the streets some nba players show up in the city wearing branded clothing and there are brand ambassadors from companies that host different competitions at companyendorsed courts players can earn currency to enhance their athlete stats through gameplay but there an obvious push to buy coins with real money to boost players faster the same can be said for myteam although currency is used to purchase equipment players and other items for your fantasy team there are multiple versions of this year game all of which provide additional bonus content for players to take advantage of in the game modes once again players will need to spend a lot of time practicing and mastering their shooting because the shot timing meter is very small and requires perfect release along with an open look at the basket for the most success while that easier to accomplish in the lowerstress environment of the practice gym it significantly harder during a game situation and even with badges to enhance a player success there will be plenty of missed shots an aggressive dunk meter works on the same principle meaning that a mistimed slam will result in a wildly inaccurate miss or failurenba walks into digital gyms with a ton of new refinements to gameplay both on and off the court while last year game focused a lot on fast breaks and shooting this year has a heavier emphasis on defense and contesting shots instead of shooters that can always float a high arching shot over the outstretched arms of a defender players can now tip reject or outright snag balls out of the air with much more frequency than ever before it also much harder to drive the lane this year meaning that you have to be willing to get rejected if you go to the low post for a layup or a dunk speaking of dunks there a new aggressive dunk meter similar to the shot meter that been added for the highlight filmready slams that get the crowd and your team up on their feet time it right and you crush the rock through the hoop with a furious slam miss it though and you brick the shot and often land on your backside as the ball flies off into an opponent hands players on the xbox one and switch will experience their career mode in the neighborhood set aboard a cruise ship while those on pc and xbox series xs will face off in an expanded city but instead of having a specific story to the mycareer mode as in previous years players will now take on the role of mp a character that built a name in high school as a basketball influencer posting clips of himself playing games on street courts and embarrassing opponents as you choose whether to take the step to the draft the developmental leagues or college you start to define the kind of player you are and your personal brand that can lead to focusing on a fashion or music mogul career as a side job alongside your nba career or you can bypass all of this in favor of focusing on the court seasonal play has also been introduced to the career mode adding new content for players to explore myteam has a lot of new features for the fantasy basketball squad mode such as draft which provides a set of packs for players to build a random team of athletes from before competing online against an opponent for some of the better cards in the mode another notable feature is the card grading system which evaluates the quality of a newly acquired card highly rated cards provide additional currency bonuses when those cards are added into your active lineup the wnba returns this year with some of the larger extras in this mode being badge progression for your athletes as well as offday scrimmage sessions similarly franchise mode brings badge progression to the front office while at the same time expanding the numbers of staffing options that you be able to interact with and control for your team success whether it defining the strength of your medical and training staff or the focus on your domestic or international scouting you manage different positions balance the financial books and build your squad for championship successoncourt gameplay has never been better but the overabundant push for spending real money and branding this year just leaves a bad taste in your mouth especially for fans focused on the sport if last year game was setting a foundation for the future then nba has solidified its dominance with increasingly improved play while it was easier to carve through defenses and drive the lane before this year features more collapsing paths faster double teams and traps that limit the fast break especially on higher difficulty levels in fact if you not careful with your shooting you find most defenders rejecting or plucking your shots out of the air embarrassing your shooter and sucking momentum from your team that makes running plays to isolate opponents or swinging the ball around the perimeter for an open shot more vital than ever before so if you haven taken the time to practice in the gym to improve your stick skills you better do so before you get blown out in a game the same can be said about shooting which has more focus on the height and arc of a shot as well as the timing of release for the shot meter and an aggressive dunk meter for flashy slams it feels awesome to flush a monster jam with a successful dunk but miss it and the clang of the ball on the rim will just make you want to hang your head in shame myteam is still as solid as ever the inclusion of a card grading system adds a new wrinkle to the fantasy team mode by boosting the output of ingame currency for each game played with toptier cards in your lineup also the option to provide new fantasy drafts before taking on opponents levels the playing field in multiplayer matches no longer will you have to face off against blatantly imbalanced teams because someone has spent tons of cash building the best starting five and bench instead your chances come down to a luck of the draw allowing your skill in the game to help you earn better rewards this is a welcome change for this mode which has been one of the most engaging but is also criticized for frequently pushing users to spend more cash to successfully take on challenges or gain credits to boost charactersbut while other elements of the game have been influenced by myteam such as bringing seasonal play to mycareer to refresh the content it also comes with a focus on branding and cash that feels like it drains the spirit of the game this year decision to move away from storydriven career modes and onto side questlike tasks makes sense the stories have started strong but haven had a successful conclusion for a long time although it odd to see characters from previous career stories giving quests just because they there but with so much revolving around branding and possibly commoditizing your player into a multihyphenate product some of the spirit of the game feels lost previous games had lots of branding from gatorade for training mobil for replays and other products in arenas but much fewer logos on jerseys this has been cranked up to an alltime fever pitch with brand ambassadors hosting challenges on their courts athletes wearing clothing from brands like mountain dew and the character jake from state farm not only showing up multiple times but asking you to wear his branded outfit sure it optional just like the choice to promote a brand in a postgame interview but after a while it feels like you playing basketball brought to you by bland corporate interests blame some of that also on the focus on your character being a basketball influencer who driven to build their personal brand while there are only a few moments where you get a sense that your choices will impact how the game plays out like a controversy over playing time for the most part your decisions don seem to affect your career which again feels lifeless moving past this problem the wnba mode which was thin last year is mildly improved with the addition of scrimmages and badges but it still needs more content and more gameplay to make it seem like a fuller mode instead of an afterthought at least franchise feels a bit deeper with you juggling and developing your staff over multiple seasons to improve and strengthen their badges that translates to advantages for your players and feels like a substantial extra for players who want to track the growth of their team over the years overall if you can overlook some of the minor adjustments and the hefty consumerism you have a fun time on the court just try not to get blinded by the ads as you make your way to the basketfamilies can talk about consumerism in sports games like nba does including logos add to the realism or just push products is there a reason to have a logo on every street corner in the game should players wear logos for products that they don actually promote in real life how do you feel about an athlete that you create being a spokesperson for different products and should announcers call out brands during their commentary what about the inclusion of characters from national commercials being included in the game should they have been added or left outhow well does nba mirror the sport are there some elements that you wish were closer to the real game should there be more emphasis on elements like the college game or the developmental leagues in the career mode should the game be closer to a true simulation or is there space for arcadelike play and lighter elements in its many modes,en,484.0,Positive

to inappropriate contentfifa is the newest take on the yearly soccer franchise with a focus on refining gameplay from the past two years into a tighter package there a lot of adjustments across each game mode the volta gameplay returns with newly included seasonal play to keep the game fresh with regular updates there also a new weekendonly mode known as volta arcade where up to four players can engage in a round of skillbased minigames to earn volta coins which can be used to customize your avatar players will also find a new skill meter in this mode and performing different moves like wall passes or taking the ball away will fill this meter allowing you to provide a score multiplayer to a goal that means that one shot could be worth or three points depending on how much you fill this bar players will also get access to new signature abilities such as powerful strikes to knock over opponents or speed boosts to blow past defenders ultimate team returns with new adjustments for your team stadium so you can have larger tifos more seasonal themes new areas for fans to celebrate in and more there also new adjustments to the divisional rival play including seasonal play that lasts for six weeks getting on a win streak with your team will allow you to make faster progress in your division and checkpoints will prevent you from losing ground during as you make weekly progress up the leaderboards the checkpoints also mean that you have the ability to continually face people at your skill level giving a better challenge from game to game additionally there an new elite division for players to try to achieve locking the best players during an entire season for a battle for bragging rights fut champions now has been split into playoffs and finals to give enhanced rewards to players putting in the time in their divisions to earn the qualification points for the end of the season there a new treatment of fut heroes based on key moments in their professional career as well as the addition of previews of what certain packs in the store will definitely contain which allows you to decide if you want to spend coins or fifa points on them the career mode returns with some additional tweaks such as postgame celebrations or disappointment cutscenes as well as match objectives for each game allowing created athletes to gain experience that can be used to refine your player attributes specifying the kind of play style they have on the pitch they also be able to unlock new perks such as enhanced team defense or better vision to create scoring chances on the field players will also gain the option to create their own club as a manager from the ground up creating their stadium engaging in the building of the squad and dealing with the board of your club all of this is anchored by the new hypermotion engine with more than animations for more fluid gameplay as well as better ball physics improved breakaways with the ball and better air battles for headersrefining this year gameplay highlights just how similar it is to the past two years titles even though the adjustments do make this installment a tighter experience overall fifa has a number of adjustments on the pitch mainly to the ball physics so it reacts in a more natural and realistic way fighting for headers feels more dynamic and unpredictable and it possible to actually accelerate past your opponent if you time your run toward the goal and get the pass in stride while last year game felt like it had more of an offensive bent to it this year defense feels a bit more responsive to closing down open lanes to the goal especially on higher difficulty levels that being said there are still some odd moments in the gameplay with players on both teams still running offsides more than they should and strange hesitations where ai controlled players hold onto the ball for a second or two before choosing to make a move or pass the ball to a squadmate it doesn make sense and feels like the new animations are fighting with older code to determine what animation should be played on a situational basisfortunately the modes have gotten varying degrees of content some of which are more successful than others volta has jettisoned the weaker storyline surrounding volta in favor of a faster paced leap into street courts around the world since this mode was always more arcadelike than the other game modes it makes much more sense that the score multiplier and signature abilities are included to make play on these courts much flashier and more action packed this is somewhat contrasted to the inclusion of the volta arcades which are restricted solely to weekends although the downside here isn so much that there are minigames like tennis team keepaway and a corner scramble to knock balls into goals instead it the fact that few people are playing this mode and its limited availability means fewer people are going to pay attention to it even more career mode does have better adjustments by contrast particularly when it comes to hopping in as an athlete the addition of perks which allows you to passively give your athlete or your team a bonus in set situations and the options to further specify your player growth through multiple skill trees and archetypes means that you have a better chance at making your athlete more unique than anyone on the pitch at your position the addition of match objectives is a nice touch because it provides more goals to accomplish than simply winning the game but if you spending any time in fut which is where many people play fifa the tweak on divisional play is a nice bonus you at least feel like you making progress against players with similar skill to your own rather than having an inconsistent set of opponents that you might walk over or be crushed by it might not seem like a big deal but the checkpointing system also reduces a lot of frustration that would arise from trying to climb the ranks only to tumble when you ran into a stronger opponent similarly the inclusion of previewing packs to decide whether or not you want to spend coins or points on the content in a deck in the store goes a long way towards minimizing the longhated impacts of loot boxes it may not be a massive leap over the previous titles in the past few years but the adjustments made to fifa improve the play on the virtual pitch to make it a stronger experience overallfamilies can talk about consumerism in fifa which is full of branding including logos billboards and broadcast graphics is it ok that the publisher makes money from gamers and advertisers too is product placement harmfulshould you buy an annual sports game if the developers release a free downloadable update to account for changing team rosters do you really need to buy one every year can you skip a year or two or do the new features and better graphics justify the purchase does it help that console gamers can get an upgrade to the next generation system

will see more activity in arenas during time outs and other stoppages in play there are also newly expanded items across the nextgen version of the game as well the neighborhood which was a beachfront for the and xbox one has been replaced with the city a massive location that includes larger training facilities and the return of team affiliations that lets players select a squad and play for bragging rights wnba players can also be fully created in this year game with a separate career mode called the w that lets players introduce their athlete to the league and build them into one of the superstars of the sport apart from league play gamers can take on other challenges on the myplayer court for wnba players the standard myplayer created athletes have also been revamped so instead of matching your character to a set of ability wedges to determine your initial skill ratings for categories like shooting or playmaking you now have a set pool of points to allocate as you see fit to make your character the way you want them to play players also have a primary and secondary takeover ability allowing them to have a significant impact on the otherwise much of the gameplay is the same as the game released in september although in the career mode players now have the option to skip college and instead choose to enter the g league right out of high school giving a more direct route to the nbanextgen hoops have arrived and while most issues have been addressed grinding for levels and other glitches take their place making it a good but not perfect game nba nextgen is built on the bones of the title released back in september that version got some things right such as introducing seasonal play to myteam with daily and timebased goals to the overall goal of creating your favorite fantasy squad fortunately the work you done in the current gen version has carried over to this version so you haven lost any ground that progress doesn carry over to mycareer but for good reason instead of an outdated character with premade restrictions you now get to create an athlete that plays the way you want from a sliding scale of potential stats that means that if you choose to skimp on your points at the free throw line in favor of being a low post player don be mad when the opposing team goes all hackashaq on your character and watches you flail at the charity stripe this gives a much wider range of customization especially when paired together with primary and secondary takeover skills that fit your play style like having limitless range and boosting your teammates skill meters as well while there should been more choice and character interaction within the story at least next gen gives players the option to skip college and enter the g league directly giving you a taste of the minor league pro life for vets of mycareer from previous years you see some familiar faces on your squad which is a nice narrative touchtechnically nba nextgen is amazing games load in seconds and the visuals look phenomenal the haptic feedback provides a nice touch to detecting exhaustion or how much effort you putting out during a game the xbox controller responds similarly but without the same intensity to its vibration for the most part players look great stars look very lifelike and close to their realworld counterparts while some coaches and bench riding players aren as impressive shooting issues have been refined so you can actually be somewhat successful assuming that you put in practice to get your timing down but the game still has some gaps the wnba career mode feels half baked there no real story here simply giving players a text based option to promote things like the league or themselves with results playing out in social media posts another issue is that you automatically in the starting lineup of the team you choose instead of proving why you deserve playing time which just feels unrealistic also while the city is a gigantic leap forward with playable areas hidden quests and new courts thanks to the return of team affiliations the space just seems empty there are lots of storefronts and buildings that can be interacted with and the number of people in the city at any time feels limited compared to its size perhaps this is tied to the level grinding that you have to do to gain access to this area which is problematic having this feature gated when players have been used to exploring buying gear and training their characters in the neighborhood in older games just feels unbalanced this is intensified by the technical hitches lag and disconnections during games that often pop up in online matches in next gen proving that while nba looks incredible some older issues are still lingering on the court in this vastly improved gamefamilies can talk about consumerism in sports games like nba does including logos add to the realism or are they only being used to push products is there a reason for a logo to be on every street corner in the game do you feel uncomfortable with an athlete that you create being a spokesperson for different products does it seem like the announcers should call out brands during their commentary of gameshow well does nba mirror the sport are there some elements in the game or in its various modes that you won find on a real court should the game be closer to a true simulation or is there space for arcadelike play and lighter elements in its many modes,en,568.0,Positive

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/fifa-20,FIFA 20,parents need to know that fifa is the latest installment in the long running soccer franchise for the playstation xbox one and nintendo switch the game builds on the content of the previous year game while also including a new street soccer mode for players that don always want to play in arenas there no inappropriate content within the game although the unmoderated gameplay during online matches could expose players to inappropriate content players will find product and company logos are on characters as well as ads posted on billboards along the sidelines of the pitch the game also comes in three separate modes with each one providing unique content and while players can play to earn credits for the ultimate team they can also pay real money for new gear athletes and items under the ccpa law you have the right to protect your personal information make a do not sell request to fifa is the latest installment in the long running soccer franchise where players can take to the pitch to play soccer with football clubs from around the world there are dozens of leagues hundreds of clubs and thousands of players available in this year game now there a larger focus on action on the pitch including enhanced ball physics as well as a focus between attacking players and defenders dueling for position this year also sees an emphasis on a character speed and sprinting ability when it comes to cutting off players or jockeying for position with the ball instead of the story driven the journey mode this year game includes a new mode called volta football here players create a male or female football player nicknamed revvy and takes them to futsal or street courts in cities around the world as they try to take on rival squads and recruit players to make a super squad before challenging for a championship the always popular ultimate team returns as well with a ton of additional content including a new group of star athletes from today game and throughout history to anchor and improve your squads ultimate team also adds new seasonal goals that can be completed for unique bonus items including stadium decorations kits celebrations and more there also a new mode fut friendlies which adds new casual ways to play such as mystery ball power ups or king of the hill sections that multiply the score of each goalrevamped gameplay the inclusion of street soccer and casual ultimate team breathe new life into this year chapter of the popular soccer sim fifa has upgraded its gameplay thanks to a new focus on the ball this year speedier players that can outrun other athletes will get an advantage when they fighting for position that means they won be run down or caught by defenders as easily as previous year games so welltimed crosses to your sprinters can be an even deadlier combination for offense this is coupled with brand new ball physics so passes that get deflected will react naturally instead of moving in prescripted ways it adds unpredictability makes jockeying for headers and passes fresh and exciting and brings the action on the pitch closer to the real game along with the updated pitch play a large addition this year is volta football which casts players as an upcoming street soccer star trying to build a squad and recruit players from around the world the fastpaced action on rooftops gyms and on converted basketball courts just feels addictive you can help but get a rush when you bounce a pass off a fence strike a quick goal between an opponent legs and flip off a wall into a victory pose it probably the closest thing we see to getting a new fifa street anytime soon and the fact that the mode expands into larger online leagues and player defined competitions will keep you coming back for hours unfortunately the story of volta is limited predictable and nowhere as engaging or deep as the expansive journey storyline from the past three years but that can be overlooked for volta play which gives a charge to the franchiseultimate team receives new updates as well with new iconic players and new arcadelike modes called fut friendlies these modes are perfect for casual players because the inclusion of power ups player swaps or goal multipliers puts a fun spin on team competition ultimate team also showcases ea take at seasonal play with unique gear and items that players can earn with play or pay for during a certain period of days this feels wisely managed and a natural way to get content because you have clear goals and info on what you earn by playing matches and gaining levels the only other weak spot in this year game is the fact that the career modes for managers and created players feel a bit stale and underwhelming apart from some additional video sequences for press conferences these modes just feel bland compared to the rest of the game and almost like the same content for the past few years but if you can overlook the stale content for volta and ultimate team you find that fifa is a ton of fun on and off the pitchfamilies can talk about consumerism in fifa which is full of branding including logos billboards and broadcast graphics is it ok that the publisher makes money from gamers and advertisers too is product placement harmfulis it worth it to buy an annual sports game if the developers release a free downloadable update to account for changing team rosters do you really need to buy one every year can you skip a year or two or do the new features and better graphics

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury,Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury,parents need to know that super mario world bowser fury is an actionadventure game for the nintendo switch this is a rerelease of a wii u game from with lots of added content as in the original game players spend their time running around brightly colored environments dressed in various powerbestowing outfits such as a cat suit making their way to each level end while solving puzzles and occasionally hopping on or shooting a fireball toward the cartoonish enemies that try to block their progress the violence is pretty tame with fantasy creatures like goombas and koopa troopas simply disappearing once defeated cooperative local multiplayer makes for a rich and rewarding social gaming experience for up to four friends and the upbeat vibe and push to explore the world and help other characters foster a sense of curiosity and discovery keep in mind though that mario is a juggernaut game property and once players get a taste for him in this game they bound to want some of his other games and related fan merchandise this includes amiibo which are used to unlock special bonus items during play new amiibo specifically themed to this game will be available for purchase during its releasesuper mario world bowser fury is a remastered and lightly reworked version of a classic platformer first released for wii u in bringing it to a fresh audience nintendo has kept the core game in which mario and his friends adventure to save the sprixie kingdom intact players explore imaginative threedimensional stages alone or with the help of up to three additional friends by running jumping climbing and dodging each character luigi peach toad and rosalina has his or her own special ability such as being able to jump a bit higher the developers have taken advantage of the switch more powerful hardware to spruce up the graphics a bit and they also tweaked some of the play systems giving players improved control by making the heroes move a little quicker and adding a picturetaking mode to make it easy to share images of the game with friends the main draw for returning players will likely be an entirely new set of stages to explore in bowser fury where mario teams up with bowser jr to figure out what has driven his dad into a fit of rage it employs the same game mechanics but places the action in a bigger freetoroam open world with catthemed objects bowser jr tags along with mario controlled either by another player or the game artificial intelligence acting as a helper who runs around grabbing coins and powerups to save you timeit no secret that the wii u never really caught on with gamers like other nintendo consoles despite being home to a number of great games like this one super mario world bowser fury an exemplary entry in the mario catalog on switch is a welcome treat its worlds are inspired loaded with seemingly endless secrets and items to collect from stamps to powerups that you can store for later use if your hero already has one and the cat suit makes for wonderfully memorable play scenarios as players try to make mario scramble up walls to reveal hidden areas and attack enemies headon it looks and plays a little better thanks to some of the tweaks nintendo made for this port but the reason it remains such a great game eight years after it originally launched is because of its timeless controls and classic design which in many ways hearken back to previous mario platformers and seem almost never to age the ability to play with others locally or online and choose from a variety of characters just adds to the funthe original game alone should be enough to convince plenty of families to pick this one up but the addition of what essentially feels like a second game in bowser fury which you can choose to start playing right out of the box from the main menu is a terrific bonus it smaller than the adventure it been bundled with but provides players with an open world to explore which isn something mario fans have had before the freetoroam design means this game doesn feel as tightly choreographed as other mario adventures and the constant threat of a raging bowser showing up to make chaos rain from the skies for several minutes can be a little intimidating though you have opportunity to make mario grow to enormous size to combat him but bowser fury provides plenty of opportunity to further hone your mario platforming skills and the lovely felinethemed world in which it set where everything from the trees and shrubs mario passes to the badges he collects are bestowed with catlike cuteness will be a treat for cat lovers it an excellent finish for what already a terrific game and just the sort of incentive that should prove alluring to anyone who loved the original but is sitting on the fence for this remaster super mario world bowser fury should find a warm welcome from players of all ages on nintendo switchfamilies can talk about mario character strengths mario started out as a standard hero saving stereotypical damsels in distress but how has his character as well as those of his allies and enemies changed over timesuper mario world bowser fury is designed to be played both alone and with others do you prefer playing by yourself or with others if you like playing with others is it because it makes the game easier or because you enjoy the social aspect,en,439.0,Positive

is an action adventure game exclusively for the playstation and playstation the game which is a sequel to marvel spiderman casts players as miles morales as he grows into his powers as spiderman and defends new york from a variety of threats combat like many comic book games occurs frequently and players will use punches and kicks as well as webbing and electrical attacks to defeat enemies enemies use firearms and explosives to attack characters as well with some blood shown if people are shot there a scene where a character is tied to a chair and beaten and some people are shown with cuts and injuries as a result of fights st and ahole can be heard in dialogue and while there are some references to drug deals and drug items these are fictional drugs set in the spiderman universe on the other hand this game features a strong amount of diversity across its spectrum of heroes and villains embracing black latinx lgbtq and disabled characters while also promoting strong and positive themes like being yourself helping others and taking pride in your neighborhoodmarvel spiderman miles morales is the latest action adventure game to put players into the costumed feet of the popular wallcrawler but this time around instead of exploring a new adventure in the shoes of peter parker players take on the role of his young protg miles morales taking place shortly after the events of the previous game miles life has undergone a number of significant changes he and his mom have moved from brooklyn to harlem where his mom has decided to run for city council he shared his spider secret with his best friend ganke a tech whiz that runs support via headset on the missions that miles goes on most significantly miles has been getting trained in using his superpowers by peter who has faith that miles can be just as good at being a friendly neighborhood spiderman as he is when peter is suddenly called away on a business trip for the daily bugle to europe peter tells miles that he has to become new york only spiderman in his absence that of course is easier said than done aside from thugs that steal toys or hold up citizens miles stumbles into a massive citywide conflict between the roxxon corporation which is opening business centers and locations around new york and a street gang known as the underground can miles keep the peace and discover what it means to be a herothis action game builds on the success of the previous title and thrusts a new hero into the spotlight with a familiar yet fresh spin on the wallcrawler it notable to see elements that have carried over as the spidey story has continued in marvel spiderman miles morales for example if you swing by fisk plaza you see it boarded up due to the kingpin arrest in the first game you still see plenty of car chases muggings or crimes for spidey to stop as he swings through the city providing him experience to improve his skills thanks to peter training which is furthered by a series of holographic challenges that are scattered around the city miles works on his combat stealth and traversal skills as he grows into his role as spiderman initially defending his neighborhood but expanding that focus to the rest of new york city over time he discovers and embraces his new abilities like his powerful electrical venom strikes that stun opponents or his camouflage powers that give him an extra advantage in landing stealthy takedowns of enemies chaining these moves together becomes seamless and as you gain additional abilities and skills you start to feel like the superhero as well similarly this feeling carries over to web swinging through the city thanks to the dualsense controller where you actually feel the tension of your webs as you swoop through the streets based on how tightly you pull the triggers it incredibly immersive and helps to draw you in as you move from one place to the otherbut the thing about the spiderman character has always the emotions and heart that the young man feels in balancing his superhero duties and his alter ego life miles like peter parker is trying to figure out his path he moved to a new neighborhood with new friends and a new school he still dealing with the loss of his father and he got awesome responsibility as a new superhero without spoiling any plot points the game does an incredible job of capturing his inner struggle as miles comes into his own as spidey over the course of the game his selfdoubt and confusion about what to do is replaced over time with faith in his abilities and a swagger that confident without being cocky this is coupled with the significant positive messages that are presented from start to finish from the tagline of be yourself be greater to miles incredible support system of his best friend ganke who constantly motivating and helping him during missions the game pushes miles and by extension the player to do good deeds and be a positive force in the world what great is that as the game goes on the people in miles neighborhood are won over from being cynical about miles as a knockoff to being someone fighting for them going so far as to claim him during a pivotal moment by stating that he our spiderman it just one of the feel good moments that lands perfectly without feeling forced or hokey the biggest issue that arises in miles morales is that the game is somewhat on the shorter end there aren nearly the same amount of villains as the previous game and if you a veteran of action games you probably fly through some of the content quickly but don let that throw you off this title is a great showpiece for the playstation and easily lays the groundwork for future downloadable content and sequels for this franchisefamilies can talk about violence in video games

everything there is to do second while there a decent number of games here these are dwarfed by other collections of minigames from nintendo like earlier release of warioware get it together which packs ten times the number of challenges into its play on top of that the challenges feel uneven in their presentation and difficulty so you can play one round of a minigame and fly through it to the

to their whims while the and nintendo switch versions offer downloadable content for purchase separately the xbox and windows versions include this content in the purchase of the gamedragon quest builders takes place about a century after the events of the original dragon quest builders players take on the role of a builder someone who has a knack for harvesting resources refining them and

you slide blocks together to make images or archery tests which challenge how well you can aim and fire an arrow but apart from the large number of trials you be tasked with becoming the champion of the gods helping to fight off typhon a monster that escaped imprisonment in tartaros and is seeking revenge against the olympians to face off against this threat fenyx will gain the use of mythical weapons and gear like the sword of achilles the axe of atalanta and daidalos wings as you explore more areas and help the gods you also gain access to some of their powers such as strikes with the power of ares or athena these will be useful when you facing off against minotaurs cyclopes and gorgons will fenyx be able to help the gods defeat typhon once and for allthis engaging adventure with greek gods has loads of puzzles to keep you busy and plenty of positive messages about redemption and being true to yourself in the face of overwhelming odds unlike other openworld games that impose plotdriven boundaries on your progress immortals fenyx rising lets you explore any part of the island influenced by the gods at any time which gives you a lot of freedom because you can explore at your own speed and make the plot develop on your terms the only limitations you face are in having the strength to face down powerful monsters and the stamina to consistently perform powerful attacks or scale cliffs even these caps are designed to get you to slowdown explore the world and invest yourself in fenyx tale as well as the tons of trials and puzzles scattered around the land regardless of whether you make fenyx male or female the character story is a positive one as they grow from overlooked soldier that no one respects or values into a formidable warrior able to destroy hordes of monsters and mythical beasts alike but it more than fighting skill because fenyx gains the respect and admiration of the gods themselves when you can make zeus introspective you doing something right and without spoiling the tale it leaves room for expansions or sequels the first expansion a new god brings fenyx to the heights of olympus to test their skills against incredibly challenging puzzles that will test your reflexes and your brainpower the focus on combat and even on significant story elements in this pack takes a backseat to solving complex multistage brainteasers the second expansion myths of the eastern realms takes players to china and presents a new take on world saving adventures with a new hero ku there a larger focus on action and puzzles and while much of it feels like a reskinned version of the title with fewer deities characters and dialogue the shape of something special is here in a way it should been its own game instead of an expansion to a previously existing titleunfortunately fenyx has some issues that keeps it from fully soaring the difficulty doesn scale to meet fenyx strength gained as a result of your exploration if you spend time fighting creatures and completing vaults you have more than enough power to destroy virtually any enemy thrown your way so you only find yourself in danger if you not paying attention or mistiming when you dodge attacks the other significant issue is that the difficulty of the puzzles isn always uniform or even so while you sometimes skip or bypass ones that are tricky it can be hard to determine where one ends and another begins that makes it hard to complete some tasks but it makes it even harder when you face mandatory puzzles that must be completed before you can move forward it worth fighting past these issues though because this game whose influences are clearly taken from breath of the wild and assassin creed odyssey is an enjoyable and entertaining journeyfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in immortals fenyx rising affected by the lack of blood and gore shown during its frequent fight scenes would the impact be stronger if the enemies you fought were more realistic is it fine because the violence looks cartoonishwhat makes a person a hero are there certain qualities that someone has to automatically have to be heroic or can they gain those qualities over time do you feel like fenyx journey in immortals fenyx rising indicates that anyone could become a hero or is this more unrealistic and solely found in a game or a

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/game-builder-garage,Game Builder Garage,parents need to know that game builder garage is a game design suite exclusively for the nintendo switch unlike games that come packed with editors to design levels for games garage sole purpose is to help players create their own games and learn the concepts of programming there no expectation of knowing anything about programming to start and users are walked through the building of play experiences in chapter styled play with supplemental lessons and quizzes to answer any questions that might arise players have the option to use the touchscreen controllers or even a mouse plugged into the usb dock of the switch to build their games and there documentation available if they get stuck or have a problem with their creations sharing your own programmed games requires a friend to be nearby or sending out a design code to other players while there extremely mild violence included in the game such as shooting ships or watching figures fall apart from playing tag or getting hit by a ball there no blood or gore and the figures don look realistic they actually look closer to blocky mannequins than people there nothing inappropriate included in the gameplay arguably players could choose to create something with that content but that would be their decisiongame builder garage is unlike other titles you seen on the nintendo switch because it not so much a game or collection of games as it is a suite of tools to help you learn how to build design and understand how games are made this is done by creating seven different premade games ranging from a racing game to a game of tag and even a title that takes advantage of the motion sensing feature of the switch to collect apples players are instructed by friendly pixels named bob and alice on how to build these games from scratch over the course of several chapters here budding designers are introduced to characters called nodons which are visual representations of programming functions each one has a personality that helps remind players of what their purpose is such as firing spheres onscreen or calculating a number of seconds before restarting the game and all of these functions can be adjusted through ingame menus players will also have access to an encyclopedia that explains what each nodon can do and how they can be adjusted as well to ensure that you fully grasp the functions that you learned quizzes and additional chapters reinforce the segments that you previously worked on once you fully completed building each game you can play the titles as much as you want and fully completing all seven also gives you space to create your own games as well these creations can also be shared with friends who can further work on your games or download them to their systems to check outif you ever wondered what it would be like to be a game designer but you didn know how to start this programming suite can help make your wildest dreams or ideas come true game builder garage doesn require any experience with typing a single line of code or debugging a program instead it takes many of the complex programming functions and commands that you would spend months or years learning about in a computer science class and simplifies them into an easy to grasp visual object system it further gives these objects personalities calling them nodons while allowing them to explain their function to players as they create the seven sample games that come with garage it a clever process that helps players learn to do the programming by doing it themselves and these skills are reinforced simply and easily with small digestible chapters that are well designed along with basic quizzes and problem solving tests to make sure that you remember what you been shown what more not only do you have these sample games that you can play through when you done you then given the freedom and space to create your own titles based off your imagination and the vast number of assets provided that where the game truly comes alive because whether you trying to program a pinball table building a simple soccer match or anything else the sky the limit based on your imagination what also very cool is that you have the option to export your creation via code so your friends can check out what you made or possibly collaborate with you on building a game in a classroom setting this would be a great way to assign and collaborate with other students on a project for classwhile it great that you can share or team up with others to work on titles this highlights one of game builder garage biggest flaws which is its limited share functionality to share your creations you have to get the code from another player sent to you to access that game there no community of published works that set up for other gamers to download titles from which is a shame especially for budding programmers unlike super mario maker which fostered a community around the many levels uploaded to the game servers garage builders will have to hope a website will be created where they can submit their game codes for players to check out similar to this there no downloadable packs or extra content available for the game so if you were hoping to see nintendo branded characters or new nodons and items to expand your created titles you out of luck these are minor flaws though and while the games that you create are basic compared to the massive top charting titles that are released by major publishers overall this is a welldesigned introduction to programming it pulls back the curtain on how titles are made which makes game builder garage a perfect way to engage and interact with the next generation of designersfamilies can talk about the work involved in creating games since you can make games as complex or easy as you want does game builder garage give you a deeper insight into what the job of being a game designer would be is it something that you might like to do or learn more about as a possible careerdo you want to work with others to create games in game builder garage or is this a platform that you want to produce games on your own and share them with others,en,423.0,Positive

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/jurassic-world-evolution-2,Jurassic World Evolution 2,parents need to know that jurassic world evolution is a theme park simulation and management game based on the jurassic park and jurassic world film franchises for playstation playstation windows pcs xbox one and xbox series xs players are tasked with breeding or capturing and then tending to the needs of a host of dinosaurs while drawing from limited financial resources potentially receiving a few highlevel kidfriendly lessons on paleontology conservation and business management in the process some dinosaurs are aggressive and prone to attacking each other park staff and patrons who can be swallowed whole by bigger dinosaurs there no blood involved in attack animations but carnivorous dinos have feeders filled with bloody animal meat while playing some kids are likely to begin thinking about the ethics of zookeeping and whether animals are better off in the wild or looked after in enclosures parents should also note that the action and storytelling are both heavily tied to the films and filled with familiar characters and scenarios this could ignite or reignite kids interest in the movies and all of their related merchandiseplayers are challenged to capture breed and care for dinosaurs and then make a profit by displaying them in attractions for the public in jurassic world evolution a theme park construction and management simulator as with most theme park sims players spend their time researching technologies building attractions and amenities managing the park finances and attending to staff morale and guess contentedness much of this is done simply by issuing commands to staff including scientists and rangers but players can also take direct control of various vehicles and enter a firstperson view to take photos and fire tranquilizer darts to sedate injured and rampaging dinosaurs a large variety of modes allow gamers to play as they like working through an original story that involves establishing a conservation program for wild dinosaurs reenacting familiar scenarios from the films such as trying to build the original jurassic park but do a better job than they did in the movie and freely experimenting in a sandbox mode where players have the liberty and resources to construct the dino park of their dreams beyond a healthy selection of modes this sequel expands on much of what the original jurassic world evolution did well adding more species of dinosaurs augmenting their behaviors and needs they can get sick or injured pretty easily and frequently require care giving scientists specialties such as the ability to more efficiently heal dinosaurs or find fossils in expeditions and then providing players the power to customize the look of both dinosaurs and buildingsmanagement sims are a niche genre but if you like the idea of building a sprawling public facility and managing a business and you have an affinity for dinosaurs this game should be right up your alley jurassic world evolution is basically the first game made bigger and better with more modes more realistic dinosaurs and more ways to customize the experience regardless of whether you new to the series or not a good place to start is the story mode which is composed of a series of missions that introduce both basic play concepts like ensuring your dinosaurs are properly cared for in their enclosures as well as more advanced elements including how to manage your team of scientists based on their specialties fans of the films can then dive into chaos theory mode which has missions based on all five movies from the film franchise that are challenging but fair eventually most players will end up spending the bulk of their time in sandbox mode where every feature of the game is unlocked allowing for some truly imaginative park buildingwhat returning players will likely appreciate most though are the qualityoflife improvements park management has been made more robust but also more intuitive it fun for example to go handson and jump in a helicopter to chase down and sedate a rampaging escapee or go out and examine how the inhabitants of a particular pen are faring but later in the game when things get a little more hectic you can have your staff take care of tasks like these with just a couple of button taps freeing you to focus on other things it a good thing too since depending on the individual traits of the animals you capture and synthesize your dinosaurs may be prone to fighting or getting sick and require a little more attention than they needed in the first game plus your scientists are now more apt to grow disgruntled when they overworked so you need to consider their contentedness as well jurassic world evolution doesn revolutionize the management sim genre but it packed with features loaded with callbacks to lines and events from the films and is perhaps even just a little bit educational a great option for the simloving dino fan in your familyfamilies can talk about learning with technology in jurassic world evolution players will learn about dinosaurs paleontology and business management but do you think games can be effective teaching tools how can you tell whether you retain what you learn while playing a gamewhat do you think about keeping animals in enclosed habitats so that people can learn more about them what criteria should we use in evaluating which animals thrive in captivity and when it may be ethically questionable to deny an animal greater freedom,en,404.0,Positive

switch pokmon games combat is the main focus of play but while players use elemental attacks to defeat their opponents no blood or gore is shown and enemies disappear in a flash of light when beaten

makes it a bit more accessible for newcomers as wellpokmon brilliant diamondshining pearl is a title featuring two games in the longrunning monstercatching franchise remakes of classic games originally released on the nintendo ds in brilliant diamondshining pearl brings players back to the sinnoh region as in other pokmon games the people of the sinnoh region love to capture train and battle their creatures and your character is no different players create their trainer and their trainer childhood friend who a friendly rival that wants to be an incredible pokmon master as well one day on your journey to a lake just outside of your town you run into the famous professor rowan who only recently returned to the sinnoh region after a fouryear absence when you attempt to give him a case of pok balls that he left behind on the shore he lets you keep one of the monsters you chosen and tasks you with filling your pokdex with information about the creatures of the land this is no simple task as players will have to move from town to town collecting creatures and defeating trainers in gyms along the way to make their party stronger there also a mysterious faction known as team galactic that seems to be taking creatures and forcing other people to do their dirty work so you find yourself fighting against their grunts and leaders in an attempt to prevent their schemes between

super contest shows to boost the skills of their pokmon as well as decorate their pok balls with stickers that will have different visual effects when creatures are summoned will you be able to become the very best trainer in the sinnoh region and stop team galacticwhile these adventures bring players back to a classic adventure in the franchise the modern enhancements take away some of the challenge that made them so noteworthy pokmon brilliant diamondshining pearl are remasters of games providing a new generation of gamers a chance to explore the sinnoh region but this isn just a basic retread of the older stories a number of enhancements have been made to freshen the gameplay for a new audience not counting the cute new visuals these include an autosave feature as you enter buildings or routes and directions whenever you access your menu screen in case you ever lost about what to do next these are supported by massive enhancements such as the option to use hidden moves to bypass barriers such as rocks and trees instead of taking a precious skill slot that isn necessarily useful in battle similarly the option to always access pokmon from anywhere you are instead of having to trek back to town to remake your party is a huge timesaver and all pokmon in your party share experience at the end of a battle even if they never been deployed in the match itself these features are paired with improved connection options to help you trade pokmon or battle with friends nearby or with other players around the world as well as an improved grand underground that feels like you getting a second massive area you can explore for hoursall that being said the largest issue with these two games is that while the enhancements make the game feel more responsive and updated it also makes the gameplay incredibly easy this is clearly tied to the experiencesharing feature which can make your pokmon so incredibly powerful that you won have an issue taking on random creatures or opponents that you run into along each route when you realize that you can also instantly swap out your party for other captured creatures without ever having to retreat to town aside from resting your creatures you breeze through gyms and opponents alike unless you send out creatures that are clearly weak to specific attacks if these games had harder difficulty levels or if it took these new enhancements into effect to scale the challenge it would be more engaging especially since these games are basically the same as they were years ago but the simplicity of the game doesn ruin the fun especially if you a pokmon fan or want to explore the sinnoh region for the first timefamilies can talk about marketing to kids with no shortage of pokmonthemed products available how do you choose the best to spend your money ondo you think that remakes of classic titles are a great way to introduce a new generation of players to a game or should designers focus only on new tales is there

the playstation xbox one and windows pcs the game attempts to present a realistic simulation of the nfl and gives players multiple options to tailor and tweak games to match their personal playing style but thanks to some of the new tweaks to the game system such as superstar and xfactor it could take a few games to fully understand how all of the adjustments work in this year game while there are no language concerns online play is unmoderated and could expose players to inappropriate comments football is a contact sport so players will see painful hits that could result in injuries to athletes although no blood or gore is shown there a hefty push of promotional content in games ranging from commercial branding in stadiums and during ingame playback to players using money to purchase content for their ultimate team to improve their custommade squadsmadden nfl tells players to lace up their cleats and take to the field once again for this season of football instead of focusing on one side of the ball or another the game focuses on the elite athletes in the league with the new superstar xfactor system which is included across all modes of play the more you perform great plays with star players the more they get into the zone this boosts their stats and gives them the chance to amp up their play on the field moving a bit faster or passing more accurately in a match while there isn a story mode there a new careerbased mode called face of the franchise where players will select a young college athlete and try to lead him to the national championship before being drafted and playing in the nfl depending on how well you play the legacy you leave could put you in the hall of fame finally the popular madden ultimate team has been enhanced this year with new ultimate team missions that put you on a path to earning specific players items or boostswhile this year version of football manages to score in some key moments it occasionally fumbles the ball in surprising ways madden nfl targets the majority of its attention this year on the athletes that dominate the action on the field the superstars of the league athletes have specific traits like the ability to break tackles or disrupt passes as you play games and use these stars to excel at their position they get into the zone which gives them a boost to their stats and onfield performance of course this isn permanent they can be countered by certain plays from the opposing team like sacking the quarterback or gaining a certain number of yards on offense the system captures those moments where a pro athlete just starts to dominate a game turning their performance into a personal highlight reel the one hiccup here is that it can be exploited by both gamers and the computer alike and if one or two players on the same team are in the zone at the same time they can be almost unbeatable otherwise it adds tension and a rush to the onfield action from down to downthis year ultimate team also packs more challenges and missions than before what nice about this year tweaks is the fact that you can select a set of challenges and play from start to finish without having to ever move out to a menu screen that great if you want to fly through skill tests and boost your squad it also nice to see that the new mission set up gives you more options to pin down exactly what kind of players or items you want and directs you in how to get them but if there was a downside to this year game it would have to be the disappointing face of the franchise mode which is a replacement for the longshot story from the past few years here you play a largely forgotten college quarterback that tries to win a national championship then triest to make his mark on the league along the way you make choices that can define your player stats and gives dynamic challenges in each week game but apart from the initial sequences with the college game and the draft there really no story here at all making it feel like a bland introduction to the franchise mode characters introduced here rarely come back and have any impact on your game apart from giving additional experience for your quarterback even your choices are reduced to very tame text options in the locker room hopefully this is either eliminated in next year game or the mode comes back with a fully fleshed out story if you overlook the weakness of the career mode though you find that madden nfl is a solid chapter to the football franchisefamilies can talk about marketing to kids madden nfl packs in lots of advertising and product logos and even pushes for some ingame purchases but is this just a way to get more money out of players do the advertising and offers make the gameplay feel more like a tv broadcastdo you think that madden nfl could get kids interested in playing football or watching the game in real life instead of sitting in front of a screen could the tutorials and lessons found in the game be used in real games of football,en,383.0,Positive

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/streets-of-rage-4,Streets of Rage 4,parents need to know that streets of rage is an arcade action game available for download on the playstation xbox one nintendo switch and windows pcs the game the latest chapter in the longrunning and popular streets of rage franchise although it the first game in the series in more than years players take on the role of characters fighting against waves of criminals and corrupt authority figures that have taken control of a city players use punches kicks weapons found in the environment and special moves to eliminate their opponents while combat is the point of the game there no blood or gore shown even when players use knives or swords on foes similarly while some fights take place in a tavern and characters use alcohol bottles to attack targets no one shown drinking or using substances some female characters also wear tight clothing and short outfits revealing most of their legs and a lot of cleavage there also a downloadable content dlc pack called mr x nightmare that adds new characters a new mode new weapons music and morestreets of rage is an action beat up that takes place ten years after the events of streets of rage thanks to axel stone blaze fielding and adam hunter the criminal syndicate of mr x organization in wood oak city was dismantled unfortunately his children the y twins have spent the past rebuilding and strengthening a new gang with larger and deadlier schemes fortunately axel and blaze recognize the dangers posed and take to the streets along with two new allies cherry hunter adam daughter and floyd iraia a muscular construction worker with cybernetic arms these new heroes will fight their way through twelve stages packed with enemies that want to sow chaos and destruction using their fists and feet to take out enemies along with the story mode and five separate difficulty levels there a harder arcade mode that gives players only three lives to complete the entire game without any saves there also a boss rush mode to fight the bosses of each stage one after the other and a battle mode to pit the playable heroes against each other to see which character is best two players can play on the same machine or up to four players can fight enemies online players can also take on the newly released mr x nightmare dlc which adds three new characters as well as a survival mode that provides a random set of missions and scenarios on a daily and weekly basis to fight through successfully clearing stages will unlock additional moves and bonuses that can be used in the main game as well think you have what it takes to clean up the streets of rageit may have taken years but this arcade beat up is so much fun and so packed with excellent gameplay that it a must have for any action fan like many other arcade games streets of rage is a good vs evil tale that incredibly easy to get into thanks to a simple control scheme that incredibly deep you only have a few buttons to pull off attacks and you can button mash your way through some parts but it the timing and combo of button presses that unleash strong blows rage even adds a riskreward feature with its special offensive and defensive moves these are incredibly powerful moves at the cost of some health from your character but if you manage to strike enemies without getting hit you can regain that lost energy and while this is great as a single player game it even better as a multiplayer experience where you and friends can take enemies on and juggle opponents in a destructive ballet of fists and feet it almost as good as the classic arcade machines without needing a roll of quarters to keep the fun goingbut speaking of arcades the extra content that been packed into this game shows just how much of a love letter rage is to the franchise and arcades in general arcade mode really tests the teamwork and skill of you and your friends removing the option to continue and only giving you a handful of lives the boss rush is also a lot of fun and lets you perfect your strategies against each boss one after the other until you complete the gauntlet or fall in battle there also plenty of galleries showing the development of characters environments and even how the developers managed to bring back some of the classic characters to this updated title that right there are unlockable characters like skate and even the pixelated versions of axel and blaze included along with the options to revert the soundtrack to the classic tunes and a crt filter to present the grainy screen lines found on arcade cabinets the biggest flaw here is that the battle mode is pretty simple and unless you playing friends that have an opinion about who really the best fighter of the bunch you not going to spend a lot of time here but even this issue is surpassed by the newly added mr x nightmare dlc which adds randomly generated stages and challenges to players as you clear a stage you gain new bonus skills such as adding poison or fire to your combo moves or rockets as you launch a special attack the more stages you clear the more points you get which will unlock new weapons moves and other items all of which can be brought into the full game what other game lets you move from a fighting arena to an street and an aircraft carrier all while tossing challenging fights at you as you level up your character it breathes a ton of life replayability and depth into the gameplay and makes it something you come back to over and over again other arcade games should take notes from this one proving that there plenty of life to be found in on these digital streetsfamilies can talk about violence in games is the impact of the violence in streets of rage affected by the cartoonish nature of combat which doesn show any blood or gore would the impact be more intense if the violence was more realisticwhat the appeal of revisiting certain franchises years after their initial release is it just a sense of familiarity and nostalgia or do these franchises still have something to offer to a new

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2019,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019),parents need to know that call of duty modern warfare is a graphic and gritty military firstperson shooter for the playstation xbox one and windows pcs players take on the roles of several soldiers ranging in gender nationality and ethnicity who are fighting a global terrorist threat with events that seem plucked from current headlines including a terrorist attack in london men women and children slaughtered in a fictional arab nation orphaned kids attempting to hide from a raging murderous soldier scenes of torture and execution and the use of a highly controversial chemical agent called white phosphorous players are strongly incentivized to avoid civilian casualties and exercise trigger discipline but the deaths of some bystanders are impossible to avoid as in one case in which an innocent man is strapped into a suicide vest with a shortlived timer some scenes call on the player to make moral decisions such as whether or not to participate in the torture of a brutal enemy by using his family as leverage the heroes are loyal to each other and determined to succeed repulsed by the evils of war but sometimes also willing to step into morally gray areas in order to accomplish what they perceive as a greater good combat involves a broad range of realistic military guns and explosives that cause enemies to bleed burn cry out in pain and flail and sprawl in authentic ways the experience is designed to be harrowing and hair raising but the game developers have also glorified the violence and want players to feel exhilarated by the rush of battle parents should note that very strong language is heard throughout the campaign that several characters smoke and drink and that images of cannabis leaves and deep cleavage can be seen in multiplayer modescall of duty modern warfare a reboot of one of the most popular subseries in the call of duty franchise puts players in the boots of several soldiers tackling a growing global threat players take on the roles of an american soldier a uk operative and a woman leading a militia in defense of her home a fictional arab country which is under siege by both terrorists and a corrupt arm of the russian military through their eyes players experience an enormous range of atrocities that result in the neargenocide of an innocent civilian population terrorist attacks on western targets and scenes of torture and execution all of which feel as though they are based on recent realworld events players are largely propelled through a predetermined story though a few key scenes allow them to make important decisions as to what they will or will not abide an important part of the game is trigger discipline which essentially means avoiding civilian casualties at all costs including holding fire on men and women who may or may not be your enemy until they reach for a weapon and become an active combatant the fivehour campaign serves as a means for players to grow accustomed to the game mechanics which are mostly traditional for a firstperson shooter though there are a few novel concepts such as being able to mount weapons on solid surfaces for steadier aim and improved cover and using hyperauthentic night vision to gain an advantage in the dark players can put these tactics to use beyond the campaign in both a cooperative mode that continues the story and in the franchise renowned competitive multiplayerthis one isn for the faint of heart call of duty modern warfare campaign is among the darkest and grittiest the franchise has yet produced thrusting players into a firstperson perspective to experience such things as horrific waterboarding torture and the terror of being a little girl chased by a murderous russian soldier intent on exterminating every man woman and child in her village and by making us carefully select targets prior to pulling the trigger developer infinity ward has taken its simulation of the modern military experience one step further forcing players to do the moral and lifethreatening thing by hesitating until we are certain that targets are enemies it makes for a harrowing yet also strangely compelling experience assuming you have the stomach for it it worth noting though that the game message and sense of authenticity is undercut to a degree by its glorification of violence while some scenes are so horrific that most players will be glad when they end others are undeniably thrilling this is the seemingly unavoidable conflict based in military firstperson shootersof course any sense of authenticity is pretty much thrown out the window once you move into multiplayer which is where the vast bulk of players will spend most of their time the new fourplayer special ops cooperative game type while storybased in theory is essentially a runandgun mode that serves up fastpaced action with a focus on teamwork and little in the way of any serious moral quandaries it undeniably fun but not nearly as emotional as the campaign and competitive multiplayer which is just as entertaining essentially abandons any pretense of battlefield realism from its wildly fastpaced combat to its chaotic and large scale new ground war mode to its reliance on funfirst mechanics including kill streaks that unlock special abilities including the controversial white phosphorous chemical attack it designed for competition and esports rather than simulating a war experience it as finely tuned as any competitive shooter and will be wildly popular among avid genre fans and probably furiously challenging for the rookies and casual players who go up against them call of duty modern warfare succeeds very well in being the game it wants to be now it up to individual players to decide whether it what they wantfamilies can talk about violence in media is the impact of the violence in call of duty modern warfare affected by the realism of the gameplay which feels ripped from the headlines what is to be learned from the gritty and authentic depiction of terrorism and

played on the playstation xbox one and windows pcs and the basic game is required to play this is a firstperson scifi shooter focused on gun melee and magical combat against a range of alien robotic and in competitive modes human enemies the expansion story is focused on carrying out vengeance for the death of a close friend and ally with little discussion about whether or not eyeforaneye justice is the moral or proper response fights are accompanied by screeches of pain spurts of black bloodenergy from aliens and robots and splashes of red blood that appear on the screen when a playercontrolled character is injured but the depiction of violence stops well short of showing more graphic content multiplayer modes demand cooperation and reward teamwork while fostering a welcoming atmosphere of friendly competitive play keep in mind that this is primarily a multiplayer game and that kids will need to play with others to access some content and have a real chance of success in certain modes potentially exposing them to inappropriate content through chatdestiny forsaken a paid expansion to destiny continues to grow the story of the player customizable character a futuristic guardian sworn to protect the remnants of humanity from all galactic evils this chapter in hisher story begins with the death of one of the series most beloved protagonists at the hands of a group of bad guys being led by uldren the pastyskinned prince of an area of the solar system known as the reef fueled by rage and sadness our hero turns hisher back on the duties of being a guardian to embark on a quest to kill everyone responsible this story adds a brandnew destination the awoken homeland to the selection of large freetoexplore realms already available to destiny players as well as a dozen or so new missions and adventures it also adds a pair of new cooperative strike missions a new raid for larger groups of friends to tackle together an almost endless array of new weapons and gear pieces including several that require quest steps to earn plus three new superpowers for each character class also new is gambit a cooperativecompetitive mode that involves taking on waves of enemies as a team collecting orbs they drop banking them without getting killed and then sending a teammate through a portal to the opposing team map to invade and wreak havoc players should note that accessing much of this content requires a character that been properly leveled up playing the base game and previous expansionsif you were to rank the many pricey expansions destiny and its sequel have had over the years this one would be near the top destiny forsaken provides a wealth of content that gives players good reason to play for a couple more weeks or months to reach the newly raised level and power caps now and respectively the new missions and adventures lead players on hunts to take down a series of nine new memorable bosses each with its own special abilities and tactics one particularly gleeful mission even involves driving a halostyle tank through hordes of swarming enemies toward the final target earning new gear like the surprisingly quick and extremely powerful legendary bow and superpower abilities that can knock off a third of a boss health in one blow are satisfying rewards for the time players put in forsaken plays it pretty safe for the most part there are no revolutionary changes to game systems or narrative direction but successfully delivers more of the frenetic habitforming action that series fans enjoy and expecta bigger change can be found in gambit a new multiplayer mode with its own collection of objectives bounties and rewards that combines elements of several popular genres of competitive modes ranging from mobas multiplayer online battle arenas to gears of war hordestyle play players experience the camaraderie of working as a team to take down waves of enemies as well as the competitive thrill of sending ai foes and sometimes even one of their own players to another team map to sow destruction it fastpaced and a bit confusing to start but once you get a sense of the teamwork and strategy required it becomes deeply compelling it one of destiny best multiplayer modes to date taken alone gambit probably isn enough to justify investing in destiny forsaken but add in the new campaign gear superpowers and cooperative strikes and you have a very worthwhile expansion that ought to satisfy most series veteransfamilies can talk about violence in the media is the impact of the violence in destiny forsaken affected by the unrealistic robot and alien opponents that you defeat would the impact of the violence be intensified if the visuals were more graphicsome modes in destiny forsaken require players to cooperate

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nba-2k20,NBA 2K20,parents need to know that nba is the latest installment in the longrunning basketball sports simulation franchise on the playstation xbox one nintendo switch and windows pcs the game doesn include any inappropriate content but players can be exposed to offensive comments in online play the most significant concern parents might have is the amount of branding continually being pushed throughout the game including nike gatorade beats express clothes and more players negotiate contracts to be ambassadors of these brands in the mycareer portion of the game gaining virtual fans as a side effect of these promotions players will earn ingame credits by playing the game which can be used to upgrade a created athlete stats buy new clothing or gear or earn new players for their created teams by purchasing card packs gamers are pushed to purchase money to accelerate their progress through the game and it also dives heavily into casinostyled item spins and pachinkolike peg boards to earn new items it is also sold in multiple versions which offer varying degrees of contentnba is the latest installment in the long running sports basketball simulation and features lots of new content and features across virtually every single game mode ten new legendary teams have been added to more than hundred team roster from multiple eras of the sport fleshing out dream team squads and competitions so gamers can discover who the best players of all time happened to be this year also includes all wnba teams and unique broadcast team for those head to head matchups across play now and season modes also revamps the shooting and dribbling controls in all modes to make the action more dynamic and even ties some of the gameplay to a revamped badge system where players can lock down opposing athletes with their defense improve their success with jump shots and many more options the myteam mode has added new tweaks to the triple threat game challenge as well as evolving player cards that improve their stats as players accomplish certain tasks during games such as scoring a certain number of points some cards and game modes will also have limited time challenges to earn some upgrades as well the mycareer mode returns as well with a new story when the lights shine the brightest focusing on che a young basketball player and captain of his team in his senior year at bay city college instead of leaving school early to be drafted by an nba team che sticks around until his senior league but when a younger player is injured and kicked off the team before a championship game che decides to sit out and sacrifice his chances at a guaranteed place in the league to make a stand and bring attention to the injustices on his team can the player lead che through the draft and will his decisions for his teammate come back to haunt his chances at success in the leaguethis year installment of basketball is one of the biggest yet but its old issues some of which seem larger than ever keep this from being a total slam dunk there plenty of new content added into nba this year across virtually every single mode for example for the first time in franchise history players can choose one of the wnba squads and play a quick match or season with those teams it a nice addition that rounds out the professional simulation of basketball in north america and could be expanded in future years you also pick up on some adjusted elements to oncourt play such as a revamped dribble system to help ball carriers break ankles before driving the lane or kicking the ball out for a quick jump shot on the perimeter from an open teammate myteam returns with a dynamic card evolution of players by completing goals in challenges which gives an additional test to your oncourt play finally mycareer has been updated with an original story where players are cast as che a college athlete that endangers his draft stock when he protests the championship game for his school after an injured teammate is kicked off his team while there very little question that che will get drafted his impact on the league is up to the player and their skill fortunately some tweaks have been made such as improving the training sessions in your team facility and the gatorade center to improve your oncourt play in a more substantive way with larger sessions and stat bonuses that last up to an actual weekeven so the career mode is somewhat thin connections you make and people you talk to in the prologue rarely come back or impact the day to day action of your character for instance your roommate in the prologue gets no acknowledgement apart from a quick line by the announcers when you play his team in some ways it highlights the consistent issue of my career which is spending money to improve your created character while there are a lot of ways to earn bonus credits and items some of which feel right at home in a las vegas casino the truth of the matter is that unless you willing to sink lots of time playing games to earn cash you have to spend money to make your player even slightly competitive on the court worse unless you perfect with your shot meter every single time you need to spend a lot of credits on improving your shot stats also you have to select badges that boost your shooting chances thereby weakening your characters in other areas if you want any chance of consistently making a shot outside of taking a layup finally there are other technical issues that haven been ironed out yet like a surprising amount of network disconnection issues in the middle of online games that not to say that nba doesn look great or play well but the ball is a bit flatter and doesn bounce as well as you hope even with all of this expanded contentfamilies can talk about consumerism in sports games like nba does the inclusion of logos add to the realism or are they only being used to push products is there a reason for there to be a logo on every street corner in the game do you feel uncomfortable with an athlete that you create being a spokesperson for different productshow well does nba mirror the sport are there some elements in the game or in its various modes that you won find on a real court,en,455.0,Positive

xbox one xbox series xs playstation playstation and nintendo switch using overlapping commutes on a london underground line the three main characters initially don seem to have much in common but the events that occur during the first six chapters of their respective stories lead to a collective seventh chapter where the three finally meet for a supernatural climax while the story rich with character development and positive discussions about complex philosophical questions players should expect frequent language and some light sexual content including a scene in which two consenting adults engage in a sexual encounter there are also a few scenes that involve the violent use of weapons though this is treated as a very serious matter with negative consequences there are also a few references to casual teenage drug use which isn explicitly labeled as a negative behavior and doesn further the plot in any waylast stops three protagonists have very different lives first theres meena hughes a former military officer struggling to balance her commitments as a wife and mother with her highpressure job at a military intelligence firm overwhelmed by problems in her family and work life she having an affair with a doctor and attempting to help break her aging father habit of selfmedicating using psychedelic drugs meena also working towards a large yet vaguely presented promotion at her job but has been pitted directly against amy ng an upandcoming agent who inexplicably favored to be chosen for the promotion despite having only a very small amount of experience in her field next theres john smith a single father working a clerical job in a government office and raising a wonderful precocious old daughter named molly though he has a problem with waking up late and forgetting his phone when he leaves the house molly always happy to help him fill in the gaps of their morning routine hoping to get in his good graces so they can have chicken tenders for dinner this dedication to her father remains when he switches bodies with his neighbor jack smith and must figure out a cure for this strange curse lastly theres donna adeleke a rebellious teenager who would rather spend time with her friends than her controlling older sister emma and their mother whos dealing with an undisclosed illness she spends most of her time with becky and vivek her longtime school friends who are teetering on the edge of becoming a romantic couple during a normal night of throwing objects at cars and trespassing the trio stumbles upon a mysterious stranger with a supernatural secretwhile hampered with disappointing technical issues this adventure is a satisfying story with fantastic writing though not a dealbreaker the most glaring issue with last stop technical glitches is its animation flaws while the environments in this fictionalized version of london are beautiful many of the character animations break often ranging from minor issues with female characters hairstyles moving unnaturally during cutscenes to more obvious problems such as more than one nonplayer character completely missing a face while normally this isn something worth mentioning these issues hamper the games pacing by being extremely distracting in addition while the cinematic camera angles used in last stop are unique and conceptually impressive they make it difficult to understand where the character supposed to walk next also distracting players as the result of odd design choicesleaving those technical problems aside though last stop has some very funny dialogue and an engrossing dramatic character arc for each of the three protagonists last stop is westworld meets the xfiles meets freaky friday and it works together seamlessly that isn a small feat additionally it worth mentioning that though last stop gives the player control over character dialogue choices these don affect the final outcome of the story given the popularity of many recent story games in which player choices do affect characters fates either in small or large ways some may see this as a flaw even though it a deliberate narrative choice all in all last stop is a powerful story about the impermanence of life and the relatable challenge each one of us faces to balance being a good family member and managing a separate life outside of the family structure players looking to games for topnotch writing complex moral questions and memorable characters will leave satisfiedfamilies can talk about the difficulties of balancing life at workschool with life as a member of a family what expected of us in each role and what challenges may present themselves when deciding how much time to spend on each set of responsibilitieswhile both donna and meena have trouble with

for the nintendo switch it provides players with tools and tutorials to create edit and share their own sidescrolling super mario levels encouraging players to be imaginative while learning the basics of game design it also allows players to build levels together promoting a sense of teamwork and cooperation players will be part of a moderated community of game makers encouraged to support and provide positive criticism on each other work through a system of likes and text comments the cartoon violence is limited to what players encounter in most sidescrolling mario games with player characters hopping on goombas and koopa troopers kicking shells off the screen throwing fireballs at enemies getting poked by spikes and being burned by flames keep in mind that the difficulty is largely unpredictable with both nintendodesigned and playercreated levels ranging from short and very easy to longer and extremely challenging note too that a nintendo online membership is required to access online featuressuper mario maker puts players in the game designer chair by providing all the tools necessary to create their own sidescrolling super mario courses from scratch the story mode sees mario working to rebuild the mushroom kingdom castle by earning coins playing through a variety of courses these courses set in the visual styles of several classic super mario games are meant to serve as inspiration for what can be done in the course editor which is where kids are likely to spend the bulk of their time the course editor lets players place every brick goomba coin and powerup making courses as challenging and imaginative as they like it adds to what was available in the original super mario maker by including a new visual theme based on super mario world dozens of new items objects and enemies the ability to add special clear conditions for your courses such as not being allowed to jump the option to set your stage in either day or night and the ability to design courses in tandem with a friend on the same system using separate joycons completed courses can be uploaded to the game community where players can carry out criteriadriven searches for new courses to play provide feedback to creators and engage in special challenges such as seeing how many random courses you can complete with a limited number of lives levels can also be downloaded with up to four players able to play simultaneously and cooperativelyif you ever thought you could make levels just as well or better than nintendo designers this is the game that will let you prove it just don be surprised if it turns out to be tougher than you thought while super mario maker is just as accessible as its predecessor you can create and publish a course in a matter of minutes with minimal instruction making a level that challenging fun and fair takes a lot more patience and practice the good news though is that this sequel adds all sorts of nifty new features to fiddle around with you can add clear conditions to your course such as making players collect a certain number of coins or climb a certain number of trees before reaching the finish insert tricky new enemies such as the angry sun from super mario bros create sloped terrain so that you can slide through enemies and drop in gadgets like a swinging claw to create fun new ways to traverse the environment and working with friends cooperatively to make levels can transform the experience into something much more social not to mention give rise to ideas that you might not have come up with on your own and if you get into a disagreement you can settle it in versus multiplayer mode where the winner is the fastest player to the flagthe real challenge though may be getting your work recognized and elevated within the community with potentially millions of players making and publishing levels players may find it tough to find an audience for their courses happily the community is well designed and easy to navigate so hopefully kids will be able to find likeminded players who provide positive feedback that helps them improve their design skills plus players can show a little more of their personality by designing a mii avatar to represent themselves within the community which might help them gain fans and create a broader base of players willing to try new courses they create and if kids discover they have a knack for building levels others want to play it not inconceivable that this game could inspire them to pursue game design as a career super mario maker doesn just satisfy our urge to play and create it gives us a small but authentic taste of what it like to make a living making gamesfamilies can talk about learning with technology do you feel like super mario maker helped you understand what it like to be a game designer what do you think is the hardest part of designing challenging but fair levelsare there any advantages to working creatively as a team to design levels

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/super-mario-3d-all-stars,Super Mario 3D All-Stars,parents need to know that super mario allstars is a collection of actionadventure games exclusively for the nintendo switch the game is actually a set of three classic games from the super mario franchise which is one of the most recognizable game franchises on the planet playing through this collection could get people interested in playing some of the other mario games and they have a large number to choose from controls are pretty easy to get a hang of especially because the game packs tutorials to ease you through learning your moves and when to use them the trick of course is having the timing to use the right skill at the right moment to successfully navigate through the hazards presented to you in each level there isn any objectionable content in the games while players will frequently stomp on the heads of creatures spin into them or toss fireballs at them no blood or gore is shown and the cartoonish nature of the gameplay limits the impact of the violencesuper mario allstars is the latest installment in the longrunning and worldfamous super mario franchise but there a bit of a twist here this isn a new adventure for mario peach and the rest of the mushroom kingdom instead this is a collection of three classic adventures ported over to the nintendo switch to celebrate the anniversary of the series the first game super mario was the first in the franchise to feature openworld exploration as players explored princess peach castle in an attempt to free her from bowser clutches in super mario sunshine mario and peach head off for a vacation to isle delfino only to discover that the resort has been polluted by a mysterious shadowy figure that looks exactly like the mustachioed hero finally in super mario galaxy the popular plumber takes to the stars to stop bowser newest scheme to conquer the universe all of the titles have been updated and optimized to take advantage of the switch higher resolution in handheld or tv mode as well a music player that includes tracks from the three games but players will have to act quickly if they want to explore these three games again after march this collection will disappear from stores and the nintendo estore as wellthis collection of classic games is a musthave for any actionadventure fans of nintendo bestknown hero super mario allstars gathers together three incredible adventures from this wildly popular series from the nintendo gamecube and wii super mario super mario sunshine and super mario galaxy have been ported over to the nintendo switch and have been visually updated with hd resolution that manages to smooth out some of the rougher edges on the older games particularly super mario which was visually revolutionary at the time but can be a bit more pixelated compared to the other titles in the set that not a knock on super mario at all it still one of the most groundbreaking platformers ever made not only did it introduce openworld exploration and characters to a sidescrolling series it added a ton of other elements that plenty of today games now take for granted like hub areas a freeroaming camera and nonlinear gameplay sure the camera of super mario is still its achilles heel because it can sometimes get stuck on objects or throw players off as they move through environments when they need precise movement but it set the stage for vastly improved play in the other games in the collection such as super mario sunshine fludd backpack that used to hover over hazards and clear pollution from the environment it all wraps up with super mario galaxy which featured new suits new functionality for mario spin moves to slingshot him around areas and a coop experience to help players collect stars for additional liveswhat more nintendo decides to toss in tracks from all three games in a music player which allows gamers to listen to the songs with the screen off it hard to avoid getting a smile on your face when listening to these songs especially if you have them playing as background music aside from this there aren any significant enhancements or extras for the games but that ok any one of these games being rereleased on the nintendo switch would be worth the price of admission for switch owners adding in all three is an incredible value but the collection does raise two minor yet significant issues the first even though this is being released in celebration of the anniversary of the franchise it raises the question of when or if we see other collections of nintendo games donkey kong and metroid easily come to mind but there are plenty of others the other is the limited availability window it a bit tricky to support having games be available only during a sixmonth release window even if these are titles that were previously released it creates artificial scarcity and limits the ability of people who are new to gaming to enjoy or appreciate these fantastic titles if they happen to get a switch just after the release window lapses hopefully this is reconsidered or revisited after march but these issues aside if you a fan of mario or of actionadventure games you need to get super mario allstarsfamilies can talk about consumerism since super mario allstars is the latest installment in a massively popular franchise do you think its release automatically promotes other games in the series does it feel like you being enticed to purchase games that were previously released on other systems or is this a good way to play games you may have missedwhat makes someone a hero is it taking a stand against something that wrong or helping others in need or are there other heroic qualities that stand out to you,en,485.0,Positive

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/pixeljunk-raiders,PixelJunk Raiders,parents need to know that pixeljunk raiders is an actionadventure game exclusively for google stadia this is the latest chapter in the pixeljunk series of games but since it unrelated to other games in the franchise you don need to have played the other games to understand the premise of this one players take on the role of a nameless mercenary contracted to save the aliens of an invaded planet and defeat their captors the ulterior motive of the mercs is to loot the planet for all it contains so the rescuing of the aliens does come across as secondary to the bottom line of making money players will use swords knives energy weapons and turrets against a variety of aliens in frequent combat no blood or gore is shown as a result of attacks and enemies disappear when defeated although cries of pain are heard there are some areas where players will see the corpses of fellow mercenaries damn ass and sons of bitches can also be heard once in dialogue while the controls are easy to learn and understand players are frequently attacked from all sides at once which can require fast reflexes there are options to duplicate the actions of players that have previously explored a level thanks to the stadia state share function but these require resources without any information of what was done this could easily frustrate players if they feel like the action was ultimately a waste and didn fit or help their missionpixeljunk raiders is a science fiction action game set on the distant planet of tantal whose peaceful inhabitants go about their days trading and living in harmony with each other unfortunately for them their planet is invaded by mysterious creatures known only as the anomaly causing chaos and forcing the survivors to run for their lives without any hope of countering these marauders the tantallians send out a distress signal which is picked up by the united planets a confederation of worlds in a nearby solar system the united planets in turn send an alert to any and all mercenaries in their territory to help in the rescue of the aliens while also turning a blind eye to the looting of any relics found in the process players take on the role of one of the mercenaries interested in a contract on the world inputting coordinates to land in areas where aliens need help they have to search the surrounding area for survivors and gather resources to build turrets or other tools they might need they can choose to follow in the footsteps of mercenaries that have landed in that location before retracing their steps by using resources to perform the same actions made by other explorers such as summoning minions or placing mines this feature takes advantage of the stadia state share feature which lets players pass content between themselves via screenshots and links to potentially clear difficult areas players will also be able to collect items from fallen enemies or chests they come across when all of the survivors in a location are rescued the anomaly hold on that area is broken and a ship commanding those troops falls from the sky rescue enough aliens and you be able to return to your ship to receive a number of rewards such as dna that can be spliced into your character for skill and stat boosts as well as patches that can strengthen your avatar will you be able to help the tantallians free their world or will you run for the hills after collecting as much money as you canalthough it is visually striking this scifi action game stumbles from significant resource issues and difficulty spikes that limit its replayability and appeal at first glance pixeljunk raiders seems like a quirky action adventure as you beam down to the planet surface hunt for relics and survivors and fend off hostile forces it fun to sprint into a camp clear out the invaders and rescue the survivors that wave gratefully and sometimes give gifts in return for your help these allow you to upgrade some of your character innate skills and abilities what also very cool is that while the game will generate some missions for you you can also create your own through keywords which will spawn new levels based on the terms used these stages can be shared with friends allowing them to explore your footsteps especially if you like the items and the challenge found in that mission similarly with the state share feature you can place imprints of mines minions or other items to help you and your friends get past tricky battlesunfortunately the cleverness of randomly generated missions is overshadowed by larger issues for example while state share initially seems helpful you have no idea what been placed by other gamers so you gambling time and resources for something that may not help you at all in the middle of a fight see players have to balance attack and defensive moves because acting too quickly leaves you vulnerable to being hit and since you frequently swarmed from all directions this means getting overwhelmed but here the trick unless you have an ability to scavenge loot from your fallen corpse you lose everything you ever gathered since you don have storage on your ship you a walking chest that one outmatched fight away from a tragedy this can leave you woefully underpowered against stronger enemies especially if you fall on a difficult stage or boss battle making replaying or grinding through stages for gear very unappealingplayers can talk about violence in video games is the violence in pixeljunk raiders affected by the lack of blood and gore shown during combat would the impact be intensified if blood and gore was actually shown does the story seem more believable when you come across the bodies of other mercenaries as you explore the worlddo you feel like the mercenaries in pixeljunk raiders are doing their job for positive reasons or are they in it for a paycheck why is it problematic to only help people if you going to get something for it,en,478.0,Positive

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/madden-nfl-22,Madden NFL 22,parents need to know that madden nfl is a football simulation for the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs google stadia and windows pcs this is the latest installment in the longrunning and sportdefining franchise which has spanned multiple system generations created gaming tournaments and is a household name by itself the title does its best to present the most accurate most realistic tvlike presentation of a football game ranging from its camera angles and broadcast commentary to its replays of crushing tackles and crowd pleasing highlights depending on the difficulty level selected by the player the game experience can be more simulation or arcade focused making success on the field easier or harder like the sport violence is key to the game because football is a contact sport so punishing tackles and injuries are to be expected although no blood or gore will be shown no inappropriate content is included in the game though the unmoderated multiplayer can expose players to inappropriate comments from their opponents but what players will experience the most is a ton of product placement ranging from team logos to endorsed products like gatorade and microsoft surface tablets the face of the franchise mode so heavily includes and references nike from its shoes to scenes taking place at its headquarters that it can feel like an ad for the company finally the ultimate team mode allows players to buy players and items for real money to customize their squads and there are frequent screens pitching gear and packs that have to be purchased instead of earned through playmadden nfl takes the field for a new season of football with an adjusted lineup to its roster of football features the biggest addition to this year game is a new gameday momemtum meter that measures the back and forth swings that occur during a football game pulling off big plays will fill the meter for either team similar to how xfactor moves work for star athletes on the field these combine with home field advantages for each stadium triggering much larger global effects on the field than ever before such as making opposing team players tire faster scrambling their play calls or boosting the home team speed this also ties into a new gameday presentation that features crowd and player reactions stadium noise and commentary adjustments have also been made to catching tackling and blocking so moves like sideline catches pocket protection blocks and tackles that take out ball carrier legs are more dynamic and impressive than before face of the franchise returns as you take on the role of a top draft pick making their name in the league players have the option to be a linebacker for the first time in the career mode or can choose to be a quarterback wide receiver or running back each week players will be presented with options like how to spend their time receiving challenges from veterans and responding to rival players for upcoming games based on how well you do you be able to put bonuses into your stats and player class making you a better deep threat ball hawk or field general additionally franchise mode itself has received adjustments such as new seasonal scenarios for coaches to respond to both on and off the field there are now skill trees for your coordinators and staff and week to week strategy decisions that will affect and enhance the trajectory of your team also returning are the ultimate team mode where players build their fantasy squad of athletes from legends and today stars and take on game scenarios similarly the yard and superstar ko mode returns for quick arcade game play in locales across the globe bending the rules of the sport but also unlocking additional items for your created player avatarwhile some elements of this year game have received attention that make them very engaging stale elements and a ton of technical issues are serious penalties for this title the most notable adjustment to madden nfl is the inclusion of the momentum meter it always been said that one big play can affect the course of a game sucking the energy out of a team and giving their opponents new life the momentum meter tracks those key sacks those big runs those massive first downs and acrobatic catches and boosts your team accordingly on top of that while each squad has seemingly random effects it can trigger as momentum builds for their side the home team also gets a bonus advantage that can use if things are going their way it might seem like it more arcadefocused than before but you be surprised at just how much you care about keeping momentum on your side because it can completely demoralize your opponent on top of this the franchise mode which felt like it been ignored for a while has finally gotten a solid boost in the form of skill trees for the staff of your team so coaches can enhance their skills thereby boosting the play of the athletes they interact with this lets you tailor your team and coordinators to fit the kind of play style you want as well as the kind of offensive or defensive focus you want your team to have this carries over to the weekly offensive and defensive strategies that you can focus on giving boosts to your team as you call plays that focus on things like gaining yards on the ground or focusing on denying first downs with smothering zone play even better coaches may ask some players to take on tasks for the team like mentoring rookies as they play each week potentially enhancing their stats and strengthening squads while franchise could go a lot farther in handling the day to day tasks for your organization this is a good first step for where this mode is headingbut while on the field play and franchise has been tweaked there a lot of stale gameplay that is disappointing face of the franchise not only feels like an afterthought the plot and the scenarios feel stiff and uninteresting your player along with his agent and brand manager don really come across as having a personality or story that you care about and it a shallow way to highlight the elements that are handled in a stronger way in the franchise mode even worse the fact that everything initially revolves around nike its campus and your trainer happens to be one of their exercise pros makes this mode come across as more of an extended commercial for their products rather than a mode in its own right superstar ko and the yard return as well but much of this is tied to driving rep and cred to a skinned avatar and while that lets you customize this character it somewhat meaningless when it comes to the field but the largest issue has to be some of the technical problems whether it players being stuck in an animation or weird visual glitches that surround referees and other characters during pregame scenes there are a number of technical issues that still plague this game the worst problems were freezes and data loss for some game modes such as playing face of the franchise or online franchise modes as a result some of these glitches forced full restarts of these seasons it hard to get a full head of steam with your friends or with a squad only to lose progress because the game crashes or still pops up some visual problems that have occurred for the past few years these issues aren enough to put madden nfl on the ir list but it does hamper its run on the way to its digital super bowlfamilies can talk about marketing to kids does madden nfl seem like it just overpromoting the products of a few key sponsors like microsoft gatorade and nike does that feel like a commercial instead of a coincidence what about ultimate team frequent push for purchased

whether or not he stays sober or succumbs to these desires additional dialogue options frequently peppered with strong language including the f word allow players to decide if his interactions with other characters will be professional and respectful or if he plays the part of a racist classist fascist jerk often with consequences or if he ends up falling somewhere in between there no combat but players will encounter scenes with dead bodies blood and graphic language describing them some influential dialogue choices may lead to other characters getting hurt or killed parents should also be aware that several characters discuss sex in frank terms with words like ct ck and dkdisco elysium the final cut is a storydriven roleplaying adventure set in a fictional city it begins with the main character a police officer waking up in a trashed hotel room with no idea who where or even what he is he relies on strange voices in his head which tell him he a member of a sad apelike species living worthless lives in a flawed society he slowly learns that he a cop investigating a murder in a shady area of town that he has a terrible substance abuse problem and that he owes the innkeeper a lot of money for making a mess of his room the entire game is spent exploring the world and talking to people to gather clues and information conversations both those with other characters and those with facets of his subconscious are the main activity providing multiple avenues of optional dialogue that shape both the story and the personality of the game hero players can make him seem respectable and professional if mildly pathetic or choose questions and responses that could make him belligerent and frequently offensive to several socioeconomic groups various tasks are heaped on top of his murder investigation duties encouraging players to collect items revisit locations and people of interest and learn more about the city and the world as they try to piece together a range of puzzles not least of which is who the hero really is this special edition of the game which brings it to consoles for the first time adds support for gamepads drops in a handful of additional story missions and includes voice acting for virtually every characterthere aren many games as dedicated to telling an interesting story filled with complex and fascinating characters as this one thanks to its mature themes graphic descriptions and often intellectual subjects and messages disco elysium the final cut is definitely geared for an older audience equipped to understand its humor which flirts with offensiveness and impropriety at almost every opportunity it a deft work of writing allowing players to make the hero thoroughly despicable based on his interactions with others and how he treats his own body or a man on a slow tough slog down the road to redemption it also laughaloud funny with jokes ranging from lowbrow there are plenty of dark giggles to be had whenever our hero entertains his addictions to cultured with witty commentary about political ideologies class war and even existence itself it a dream game for bookish sorts who love the idea of sinking into a fascinating role but have little interest in combatthe new final cut edition is meant to build on the awardwinning original and it does this by adding plenty of quality voice acting to flesh out characters both real and in our hero subconscious it also includes new tasks and items meant to add to the world backstory as well as dive into our protagonist sociopolitical leanings as determined by the player dialogue choices the only real issue with this edition is that switching from mouse and keyboard the controls for which this game was originally designed to a gamepad has introduced a few interface problems such as occasional trouble finding and moving down certain paths while exploring and difficulty highlighting and selecting some of the objects and characters with whom you want to interact thankfully these aren gamebreaking problems disco elysium the final cut is decidedly not meant for kids but older players who appreciate great storytelling with a liberal dose of edgy humor are going to have a blastfamilies can talk about character strengths did the police officer in disco elysium the final cut as you chose to play him exhibit any traits that you think are worth emulatingdo you think the voices the police officer hears in his head urging him to do drugs and consume alcohol are realistic or are they so farfetched as to be merely comical,en,439.0,Positive

playstation xbox one playstation xbox series xs and windows pcs the game is the latest chapter in the watch dogs series which pits a group of hackers against corrupt politicians and government officials to free the citizens of london from oppressive control and the elimination of their rights to fight back the group does everything from pranks and destruction of propaganda to stunning enemies and even shooting or blowing up opponents violence and combat frequently occur with players using their fists firearms drones turrets and more to eliminate characters blood is shown when defeating some opponents although cutscenes show some scenes of body horror stabbings shootings and more profanity is frequently used with fk st ct and twat often being uttered some female characters wear tight clothing with a lot of cleavage showing while other characters are described as porn stars or visiting porn sites frequently there are also portions of town with graffiti describing genitalia sex shops and prostitution players also have meetings in their safehouse which is set beneath a pub where characters are shown drunk or in states of inebriation characters can also drink with the screen showing the effects of the liquor in their system and some missions feature drugs or drugrelated itemswatch dogs legion is an open world action adventure set in a futuristic london that has undergone significant upheaval and chaos with a government that restricted the rights of its citizens and turned over their personal information to corporations fighting back against this oppression and loss of rights is the london branch of dedsec a hacker collective that seeks to liberate the population from these crippling societal controls unfortunately on a mission a separate organization known as zero day bombs landmarks around london and pins the blame on dedsec getting them branded as terrorists afterwards a security company named albion takes over london with the use of security drones automated checkpoints and armed guards controlling the lives of the people under the illusion of security and justice the only possible way to fight back is to resurrect dedsec from its ashes instead of taking the role of a specific character players will recruit their team from the people on the streets of london so anyone could become vital to your mission a former spy the homeless even a little old lady feeding pigeons in the park bringing them over to you side can involve handling a task related to solving a problem in their life making a larger disruptive impact to free segments of the city from invasive control or in some cases simply walking up and asking a person that has benefited from dedsec previous activities if they like to join the cause can dedsec cause enough mayhem to get the people behind their movement more importantly can they figure out who framed them and put an end to their schemesthis hackingfocused adventure does an incredible job of giving players the flexibility of stepping into the shoes of anyone in london but its biggest stumbling block ironically is techbased watch dogs legion is a dire take on a future where citizens are no longer free in their own city because their government has sold their security and safety to a private military corporation coupled with tech that tracks their every move the conditions are ripe for revolution the commentary about cryptocurrency driverless cars drones illegal immigration and other issues feels ripped from today headlines the big twist here is that any character can join your cause and help start the revolution everyone on the streets is a possible agent in training the grandma that skilled with robotics the homeless girl packing a silenced the hypnotist street performer that can convert guards to your side for a mission these are just some of the people you can profile and bring onto your team rounding out your squad needs for a particular mission that also means that you can intentionally choose to make a mission harder by picking a someone that has to take a more direct route than a stealthier path in levels based on their skill set additionally the option to choose anyone makes london feel more alive and realistic than virtually any other open world game because each character has their own motivations and needs to fulfill for example if you prevent a random character from being arrested their spouse or family member might remember that and may be more willing to join the cause accidentally kill someone or cause their problem to become worse and you may make an adversary that will come back to haunt you including kidnapping some of your teammates and threatening their lives the overall result is that you not only care who on your team but you start looking at everyone as prospective teammates instead of random citizenslegion gameplay is incredibly ambitious but while it shoots for the digital moon it manages to suffer from some significant bugs environmental objects suddenly pop into existence or won always respond to commands which can hinder the solving of puzzles or missions character profiles and voices for your team will sometimes swap out with recruits which can be somewhat confusing when you picking team members for a mission but the most significant problem is that there are random crashes and freezes that will pop up forcing you to restart and reload the game it ironic that a game that so steeped in tech such as the hacking drone direction or scene reconstruction by holograms suffers from tech glitches many of these problems are scheduled to be fixed by upcoming patches so if you can overlook these flaws watch dogs legion presents one of the deepest most believable open world experience to

two factions is brokered by the impending marriage of lucis prince noctis to the oracle of tenebrae lady lunafreya unfortunately as noctis travels with his friends gladiolus ignis and prompto to the

new final battles a soupedup combat mode and new side missions it also comes with a new fishing vessel that opens up new areas to explore along with new places to fish and recipes to cook from your hunting excursionsthis longawaited rpg provides an epic adventure that fantasy and adventure fans simply have to play even if they never tried a game in this franchise final fantasy xv may have taken a decade of production but it manages to deliver an adventure that clearly builds upon the legacy of the series by merging several genres together successfully without spoiling anything because you really should discover this game for yourself the lands of eos are open and fully explorable completely embracing openworld gameplay whether you travel only through the plot explore side quests or fight through hidden dungeons the option is yours at any time the quest structure along with the management of each squadmate feels like it taken directly from a massively multiplayer online mmo game even though this is completely a singleplayer title what more the game manages to make the four main characters seem like real people instead of simply robots driven by ai plus while you can opt to give strategic individual commands it designed to play more like a hackandslash action title you wouldn think these elements would work together but they fit like pieces to make a larger immersive puzzle of this world even the addition of newer gameplay elements such as the photography cooking and survival traits of noctis friends compliment classic series elements such as racing chocobos birdlike creatures and using a skill tree to boost abilitiesthere are a few issues that arise during play you may see the occasional glitch here and there as characters get stuck in the ground or perform other odd behaviors that break the world some tutorials should go into more depth to explain what you can do particularly related to creating magic or locking onto some targets another curious decision was to leave out additional plot points and background information in the game keeping much of it in the separately released kingsglaive final fantasy xv movie which players should definitely watch to fully understand everything happening before and during the earliest segments of the plot it an odd admission for such a large story finally there are some pacing issues as you move toward the end of the main quest things feel very rushed as chapters are suddenly completed with significant battles near the end of the story but these are very minor complaints about a game that has a ton of gameplay especially since square enix has spent more than two years regularly releasing content for the game its latest set of dlc the royal pack expands gameplay with items like new dungeons and areas to explore a firstperson view to bring you farther into the game and a revamped section of insomnia city which adds new boss fights and scenes to the end of the game while the fishing additions may not intrigue some players the other content is easily more than enough to bring back players that haven jumped into the land of eos for a while if you a final fantasy adventure or roleplaying fan you owe it to yourself to dive into this game you may even find some of your new favorite characters waiting to adventure with youfamilies can talk about violence in video games is it a problem that

battlefront ii is relatively easy to pick up and play though some aspects of it have a steeper learning curve than others since combat is a central focus violence in the game is a core part of the nonstop action even so the violence is never graphic or bloody with defeated enemies simply falling over and vanishing from the battlefield parents should also be aware that battlefront ii has an ingame market where players use credits earned through gameplay or crystals purchased with realworld money to unlock additional contentstar wars battlefront ii is the direct sequel to ea hit shooter

entertain themselves in solo or couch coop splitscreen arcade matches it online matchups where the game truly shines whether you fighting in small eightoneight strikes starfighter dogfights or a huge galactic assault battle the gameplay is fluid and natural it never feels like things are too crowded or too spread out and you always feel like you an integral part of the action plus if you manage to earn enough points to enter the fray as a hero character you can help but get a sithlike joy from watching foes flee from your power unfortunately this leads to the one glaring exhaust port weakness in the game microtransactions upgrades to items and abilities are locked in the form of star cards and have to be either crafted or purchased with credits or crystals credits and craft materials can be earned by playing matches and achieving specific career milestones while crystals can be bought with realworld money this means that new players will usually jump into battle at a disadvantage unless they willing to take the time to earn some credits via gameplay or shell out the cash for crystals and though eight of the game initial roster of hero characters are unlocked from the start the remaining six can be purchased only with credits so if you want the chance to play luke skywalker or darth vader in a match you need to grind through enough matches to earn them and since credits are also used to purchase upgrades for the rest of your troops it can take a while it not enough to blow the game apart like alderaan but it still enough frustration to cause a slight disturbance in the

xbox one playstation playstation stadia amazon luna and windows based pcs players take on the role of a guerrilla resistance fighter trying to overthrow the dictatorship of the fictional country of yara players can choose to play as either the male or female protagonist at the start of the game each with their own look and voice acting but with no change in the overall narrative the game brutally violent with lots of blood and gore throughout there are scenes of torture executions violence against animals etc it also makes frequent use of strong profanity and shows characters drinking alcohol and occasionally taking drugs there are also references to sex work human trafficking slave labor and other criminal enterprisesfar cry welcomes gamers to the fictional country of yara an island paradise on the cusp of a return to greatness this is due in no small part to its discovery of a revolutionary cancer treatment ironically developed from a unique strain of tobacco harvested exclusively on the island it through this that anton castillo yara fascist dictator plans to restore yara to its former glory while forcibly molding his young son to carry on his legacy into the future paying the price for all of this are the people of yara who live in a classist society where the poor are stripped of their rights drafted into slave labor camps forced to participate in drug and human trafficking operations and executed in the streets for any show of defiance to castillo will dani rojas grew up in yara and has had a firsthand view of castillo cruelty barely surviving an attempt to escape yara dani winds up in the camp of the resistance movement libertad convinced to join their cause dani becomes a soldier for the libertad as dani it up to you to travel the vast open world of yara using guerilla tactics and mass destruction to chip away at castillo dictatorship while taking back the hope and the freedom stolen from the yara people viva la revolucionwhile ubisoft is no stranger to making great gaming experiences over the years the company has honed its skills by creating truly memorable openworld cinematic adventures far cry continues this trend offering players a huge open world sandbox in which to play any way they like while still crafting an engaging plot that feels like a summer movie blockbuster the story is an extreme look at life under the oppressive rule of a dictator giancarlo esposito does an amazing job of bringing the fictional yara leader to life in all his brutality even when his character isn onscreen his presence has real weight throughout the game and by giving players the opportunity to play as either the male or female versions of dani rojas both also superbly represented onscreen it allows the story to unfold through the eyes of a fully fleshed out character that they can still relate to this isn a story for kids though as there are brutal scenes of violence throughout including torture executions child abuse slave labor and more and even though the far cry series has always pushed the boundaries of violence in its themes there an extra layer of realworld influence here that makes these scenes a bit more disturbingas dark and grim as far cry base story may be its gameplay is a massive openworld toybox of mayhem and fun the overabundance of absurdity is easy to forgive when it gives players the chance to pull off the wall strategies like parachuting into an enemy base from a makeshift helicopter releasing a cloud of psychotropic gas before slicing soldiers in half with a cd launcher playing los del rio macarena all while sending your leatherclad pet crocodile to polish off any stragglers and that not anywhere close to the craziest thing that you can do admittedly there can be a little repetition in some of the side missions but considering the range of options for dealing with them they never feel stale and as much fun as the story is to explore by yourself bringing a friend in for coop play is a great way to share in the shenanigans best of all progress you make in the coop extends over to the solo campaign as well meaning there no reason not to team up that not to say everything in far cry gameplay is about good times and laughs there are some parts of the gameplay that can make players feel a bit uncomfortable like killing guard dogs or betting on cockfights still the bulk of the game is like taking an active role in an adrenalinefueled action flick couple that with a story that keeps players interest and far cry is a virtual paradise for mature gamers looking to feed their hunger for adventurefamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in far cry affected by the amount of blood and gore in the game what are some of the

the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series x and windows pcs players alternate between taking on the role of a new republic pilot and an imperial pilot the action presented from a firstperson perspective within a cockpit there no blood or gore but players will see ships bursting into flames and hear people crying out in pain over the radio plus while playing as an imperial players are tasked to shoot down innocent civilian ships and medical frigates the new republic pilots are clearly the good guys fighting for a righteous cause but as the game progresses the story becomes more about the camaraderie between pilots and officers in each faction and in some cases the grudges they hold multiplayer modes encourage players to work together and communicate as a team parents should also be aware that this game has potential to draw kids even deeper into the sprawling star wars franchise including related merchandise and paraphernaliastar wars squadrons is set after the battle of endor and the destruction of the second death star it focuses on a pair of space fighter squadrons the new republic vanguard squadron which is working to defend the construction of a powerful new republic flagship and the empire titan squadron a group of tie pilots assigned to destroy it players alternate between both squadrons attacking installations including civilian craft and medical frigates to weaken the growing power of the new republic as an imperial tie fighter ace and conducting raids on imperial ships and carrying out escort missions as a rising star in the new republic fleet the short solo campaign serves to acquaint players with a variety of ships and weapon loadouts as well as become accustomed to the controls ship systems and strategies used once the story mode is over players will be prepared to take on competitive online play where they can pick a fighter and loadout and either engage in deathmatchstyle dogfights or jump into bigger fleet battles where squadrons must work together to take down enemy corvettes and battleships while simultaneously evading or engaging with swarms of ai and humancontrolled fighters as players level up they earn additional ship loadout options and cosmetic upgradesthe story and characters are a bit of a snore and morally complicated but the space combat is a lot of fun star wars squadrons gives equal time to pilots on both sides of the war between the galactic empire and the new republic for better and worse this setup makes sense for multiplayer since players will sometimes be forced to take on the roles of imperial pilots when playing online but it makes for tricky storytelling for starters as an imperial you be assigned missions that involve the destruction and death of presumably thousands of innocent civilians which makes it hard to really get on board with any of the imperial characters we meet the writers combat this problem by making the imperial story more about personal revenge after a betrayal and defection but shooting down innocents is still a hard pill to swallow and the fact that half of the already short story is given over to the imperials means we don have as much time to get to know the real heroes in the new republic it all nets out to a bit of a disappointing star wars taleon the other hand the campaign does a fine job of introducing the many subtleties of space combat and gets you ready for online play where most players will spend the bulk of their time the benefits and drawbacks of each available ship from the speedy and agile awing to the slow but powerful tie bomber are explored in carefully scripted missions which also introduce various weapon shield and hull loadouts as well as targeting and resupplying the story also offers an opportunity to get a feel for how and when to shift power in each of these ships boosting shields when necessary useful when flying into battle against a capital ship from long range shifting energy to engines to beat a hasty retreat or funneling all power into weapons to deliver a fast and massive strike all of this information and experience is invaluable in online play where human opponents tend to be smarter and faster than ai pilots different ships are required for specific scenarios and the odds of success depend directly on the skill of the pilots involved star wars squadrons isn a mustplay

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/no-mans-sky,No Man's Sky,parents need to know that no man sky is a first and thirdperson scifi simulation game where players explore a virtually endless universe filled with massive planets alien life and technological secrets the bulk of the game is composed of exploring discovering and using resources to craft new items and technologies players spend much of their time searching for rare minerals which can come from crates plants rocks and even animals perhaps sending the message that the universe and all within it exists for us to exploit as we like players can also engage in battle with aliens and machines including those that pose no threat should they choose though most creatures will fight back if attacked and many are much more powerful than the player character the gunbased combat involves explosions and bursts of light but no blood or goreno man sky begins with the player character stranded with a broken ship on a random planet near the outer rim of the galaxy it up to you to explore discover and figure out where to go and what to do you begin by searching the nearby area to find crates plants rocks and animals capable of supplying the minerals needed to fix key parts of your ship once it fully repaired you fly to the stars eventually traveling to any point of light you like there are literally billions of unique randomly generated suns in the game each with its own set of enormous planets and moons many teeming with their own types of plants and animals some of which are dangerous for defense your character is armed with a gun that can also be used to break apart rocks and destroy barriers a lengthy story involving the discovery of alien secrets is available but it up to you to decide where to go and what to accomplish you gradually discover recipes for new technologies better ship parts and improved equipment that encourage you to hunt for rare minerals land in space stations to trade items and buy better ships and encounter ancient alien relics that help you slowly learn alien languages as the game progresses you learn to build bases anywhere you like on any planet you visit as well as begin putting together and taking command of fleets of enormous freighters that can help with resource collection and movement around the galaxy it a shared universe so you can choose to adventure with small groups of friends or strangers but the entire game can be experienced playing solofew games made by only a handful of people are more ambitious than this space adventure no man sky provides us with a randomly generated universe nearly as big as the one we physically inhabit making the possibilities for discovery virtually endless the unexpected things you find and the places you see in the opening hours hint at the vast essentially infinite scope of the experience and this huge game has continued to evolve during the first couple of years after launch with free content and feature updates such as the ability to view your newly customizable astronauts from a thirdperson perspective and find other players with whom to go on shared adventures better still is the ability to build colonies and bases anywhere you like and create and command fleets of freighters these additions provide a bit of muchneeded automation while also making it easier to transport resources and travel to previously visited locations the story has continued to grow as well with new quests and a dynamic story that provides a deeper understanding of the universe we explore you can spend dozens of hours chasing down answers to ancient mysteries or you can spend just as much time simply trying to get lost in the cosmos to see what you can find and what sort of amazing items you can craft it all up to youbut there are a few chinks in no man sky armor of freedom perhaps the most frustrating thing players will encounter at the start is the small and restrictive inventory you find all sorts of elements and items you want to collect but within the first hour you likely need to start prioritizing which ones to keep and which to leave behind as empty slots fill up also tiresome is the need to spend time searching for and harvesting basic elements and resources standing in one spot vacuuming up copper or iron for a long time hoping that sentinel robots don spot you and begin attacking gets old within the first few hours of play by hour or you be wishing desperately that you could craft a star trek replicator that could just spit out whatever you happened to need at the moment even with these problems though no man sky is well worth playing simply to experience what it like to explore a nearly endless galaxy full of wondersfamilies can talk about technology addiction a game like no man sky never really ends which means some players could keep playing for months or even years so how do you enjoy a game that can consume countless hours while ensuring you don overdo itdo you find exploration in the real world exciting or scary what rewards come with going places you never been and discovering new things do you think there are any places left on our planet that people have yet to explore,en,398.0,Positive

archery challenges and establishing animal sanctuariesthis adventure game set in feudal japan grips you from start to finish with its visuals and story which make you feel like a samurai facing off against overwhelming odds as jin sakai in ghost of tsushima director cut players discover his honorbound warrior code simply doesn match up when it comes to fighting the invaders as a result he reluctantly adopts unconventional methods and techniques to eliminate his enemies such as using smoke bombs to vanish from sight or stealthily infiltrate enemy camps eventually he merge and evolve these skills into a flexible fighting form one that befits his new persona as the ghost it incredible to watch jin terrify enemies when he calls out opponents for a dueling standoff and then vanish before reinforcements can arrive also duels highlight jin mastery of swordplay and feel pulled directly from a samurai movie it interesting to watch jin evolving sense of what it means to be a samurai in these troubled times an evolution that isn isolated to him his allies who have varying degrees of morality and honor have their codes tested as well without spoiling any details there are some dark quests for revenge and redemption which serve as a warning to jin about the hazards of giving in to emotion and about fully embracing the persona of the ghost as it could potentially doom him to a darker path it torturous for jin and it tugs on the player heart to watch his complex struggles the director cut also adds the new territory of iki island specifically tied to jin past it allows him to explore his failings and eventually find redemption for himself and his family while you can access the eight to hours of content in this part of the story about halfway through the main quest do yourself a favor and finish the game before departing to iki the events of the island carry so much more weight once you completed the talecountering the darker themes is simply how beautiful and atmospheric the game looks camera angles and shots look like they plucked straight from a movie or a painting and that even without including the customized kurosawa blackandwhite grain filter whether you galloping across fields of pampas grass standing in a dueling ring as leaves tumble around you or wandering through forests the environment is breathtaking plus the world directs players in a subtle and natural way such as foxes that lead players to shrines that strengthen their personal resolve or birds that lead players to points of interest the director cut builds on this with the inclusion of animal sanctuaries where jin will play a flute directed by tilting the controller up and down to gain the trust of a wild animal it a beautiful moment included as a time of reflection in the story the game even encourages players to compose their own haiku at vistas that inspire reflections of hope or despair not only does this help to make the world feel more alive but it makes jin and his progress seem more alive and closely tied to the land overall ghost of tsushima is an amazing story loosely based on the real invasion of tsushima that makes players feel like a true samurai on an epic quest if akira kurosawa had the opportunity to make a video game ghost of tsushima would be the story he would tellfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in ghost of tsushima affected by the amount of blood shown from sword fights would the impact be lessened if there wasn as much blood or gore shown would it seem as realistic or believable if the blood or gore wasn includedwhat are you willing to sacrifice for is there something that you wouldn sacrifice regardless of what the situation might be how would you respond if someone questioned your actions in choosing to give up something you held dear especially if it was for a good cause,en,516.0,Positive

submarine controls by following stepbystep instructions provided by ingame videos players are encouraged to customize their ingame vehicles with the addition of a cardboard spray can which allows players to produce paint jobs and decals on their machines thanks to the suite of programming commands players can also learn to make simple or complex devices and toys which could also foster an interest in computers and engineering cars in the slot car and circuit mode can run each other off tracks by colliding together but no damage is shown and cars quickly reappear on the road in the adventure mode players can fire missiles and launch bombs but only smoke and flashes of light are shown when these connect with targets otherwise there no inappropriate content to be foundthe nintendo labo toycon vehicle kit is the third collection of minigames and buildable activities featuring nintendo customized set of cardboard and digital games you don need to own the previous two kits to use this one but this time around labo leaving the robots and variety items in the dust in favor of transportation after carefully following a series of stepbystep instructions players will make a steering wheel flight joystick and submarine tower these are unified by a cardboard key that holds the right joycon controller this tells the system which machine it controlling at any time and a gas pedal holding the left joycon controller to make them go players can access a few minigames this time around the circuit racing and slot car minigames share racing tracks and can pull designed tracks from the labo variety kit if you have them saved on your switch there even a battle arena where your cars can fight it out bumper car style against each other and a rally mode where you drive through colored gates to get the best time there also an adventure mode where players are tasked with accomplishing more than tasks across separate distinct regions here players will need to dive drive and fly across the various environments to complete the goals scattered across the land outside of this the toycon garage mode returns to help players learn to build and design additional toy devices thanks to its set of programming commandsthe third installment of nintendo cardboard toyminigame collection puts players firmly in the driver seat and gives them a large digital world to explore the nintendo labo toycon vehicle kit builds on the strengths of the variety and robot kits with their excellent stepbystep tutorials to help you construct controllers it also brings along the great toycon garage which gives hints on everything from how to play some games to decorating their controllers to programming new cardboard toys but the previous kits were easily dinged for having minigames that quickly became stale along with controllers that didn really interact with each other once built this time around the true standout is the adventure mode which uses every controller to fully explore a virtual world you dropped into one of separate regions each with a set of goals to accomplish like escorting escaped cows back to their corral blasting ufos or balloons out of the sky or freeing trapped creatures underwater but you won be able to complete each task in one machine fortunately by pulling the cardboard key out of one controller and slapping it into another your vehicle seamlessly transforms from an offroad vehicle to a jet to a submarinethis quick transition makes exploration very appealing and you go hunting through each region looking for reasons to swap between each controller on the other hand the transitions between controllers highlight some issues for the kit for one thing the controllers are more complex and test the handeye coordination of gamers more that especially true when it comes to balancing the easier controls of the offroad car and the more complex underwater turbines of the sub what more the constant swapping really means that you need to play this game with the switch comfortably docked and connected to a tv there only one screen stand attached to the top of the steering wheel but it very awkward to watch that small screen especially if you need to switch over to the sub it worse if you have the controllers in your lap just spare yourself the frustration and dock the system but these minor issues aside the vehicle kit manages to bring a new expansive world to nintendo cardboard creation franchise players interested in programming creativity or machines won go wrong with this onefamilies can talk about screen time some cardboard models in the nintendo labo toycon vehicle kit can take a while to complete so should you take breaks between steps as the software recommends is there a reason that you would ignore breaks

characters in both the zombies and competitive multiplayer modes are clearly enthusiastic about their work enjoying the rush and chaos of battle and spending little time reflecting on the danger and horror around them playing with friends can encourage cooperation strategic thinking and teamwork but playing with strangers will often result in players being exposed to insulting and derogatory remarks from teammates in addition to the game graphic and glamorized combat players will also be exposed to plenty of very strong language a character who smokes constantly and dialogue that references drinking keep in mind too that players are encouraged to purchase additional content within the game including maps and cosmetic upgradescall of duty black ops does away with the series singleplayer story mode in order to concentrate on online play classic competitive multiplayer returns with a focus on specialists characters with unique abilities such as a grappling gun an attack dog cluster grenades and more after working through tutorials that provide backstory on each specialist and practicing with their special skills players engage in familiar game types such as team

confident in your abilities you can test them in a new game type called rush that ramps up the speed and difficulty and adds a competitive element via a new scoring system zombies has never been this strong out of the gate at launchbut the most striking addition to this multiplayerfocused edition of the blockbuster shooter is blackout it might follow a formula already well established in plenty of other battle royale games and the visuals take a noticeable hit compared to other modes thanks to the enormous map and number of human avatars at play but it runs very smooth and loading times are almost nonexistent plus it has a distinctly call of duty flavor thanks not only to its locations easily recognized by any veteran of the series but also its willingness to include some distinguishing features from the game other modes including remote controlled recon cars grappling hooks and in one area even some shuffling zombies to slaughter whether you want to go it alone or group up there dozens of hours worth of exploration strategy and challenge waiting for players to discover here blackout won replace what was lost for those mourning the death of the franchise singleplayer mode but

session you can launch one of the minigames to test your skills and at the same time get practice for when these activities show up in the adventure mode all this being said ring fit isnt perfect the

for the playstation and xbox one the game has lots of bloody gunfights some very strong language and mature narrative themes missions typically end in shootouts involving revolvers rifles shotguns and other period weaponry slowmotion effects highlight head shots and critical wounds with sprays of blood hovering in the air scenes of carnage and torture including hanged and eviscerated people can be stumbled upon in your journeys the player character arthur is an antihero he does terrible things including murder and theft but he feels a powerful sense of guilt over them these deeds are counterbalanced to a degree by his clear and innate understanding of right and wrong this often leads him to help random strangers including coming to the defense of victims of racism and sexual assault which helps arthur become more honorable in the eyes of those he meets but he continues to choose to be an outlaw out of a sense of duty and obligation to his fellow gang members the game strives to accurately depict its setting and era which means plenty of drinking and drunken behavior as well as characters who regularly use tobacco and chew cocaine gum strong language including fk st and the n word frequently appears in dialogue characters discuss sex frankly and prostitution can be found in towns one mission involves arthur attempting to extract a sex worker from her perilous profession red dead online mode allows players to create their own avatars selecting from two genders and altering skin tone online play also allows players to purchase gold bars using realworld money these gold bars function as ingame currency for the purchase of cosmetic upgrades to characters weapons and gearset in a little over a decade prior to the events of the original red dead redemption puts players in the spurs of arthur morgan one of the main members of the van der linde gang at a time when the existence of outlaw gangs in the west is speedily coming to an end arthur is the crew main muscle a grizzled conflicted man who bought into the gang leader philosophy of stealing only from those who can afford it helping those in need and searching for a place where they can be truly free but as the law closes in on them the posse becomes desperate forced to resort to riskier and more ruthless jobs that leave arthur racked with guilt and seem likely to lead them all to tragedy this epic story plays out over the course of a lengthy campaign that takes place on a massive map of several fictional us states which players can freely explore to find towns homesteads optional missions and strangers in need the game also functions as a detailed simulation of western life with players tasked not just with performing outlaw activities such as robbing stagecoaches and rustling cattle but also with doing camp chores looking after horses oiling guns hunting skinning and cooking animals even shaving arthur facial hair many side missions explore key issues of the era including the plight of native americans deprived of their land lingering racism in the south and women marching for the right to vote much of what arthur gets up to eventually ends in cinematic gunfights but players will also spend large chunks of the game simply galloping through forests swamps and meadows in search of whatever might be found over the next hill expect to spend upwards of hours working through the campaign and side missions red dead online mode lets players invest even more time as they create their own outlaw avatars and either join up with with a posse to take on new missions or work against and foil others playersif you looking for an enthralling interactive story it doesn get much better than this red dead redemption feels like half a dozen seasons worth of the best sort of adultoriented tv western you can think of rolled into one immensely ambitious game with poignant emotional writing and awardworthy performances to go with it the tale of arthur morgan and the van der linde gang is gripping from its first moments which take place in the aftermath of a job gone awry as the crew escapes into a winter storm in the mountains as we get to know the key players each with his or her own motivations and history the trials and fate of this motley crew only become more compelling one thing this game gets right in a way few other openworld adventures can match is the sense of purpose invested in everything players do each mission has its own context and dialogue and feels like a unique event meaning repetition is essentially nonexistent nothing exists simply to pad out the game virtually every activity no matter how short is designed to tell a bit of story grow the world provide new insights into characters or better familiarize us with what we can do in the game it all combines to create an astonishingly cinematic and memorable western yarnlending a hand in creating an impeccable sense of time and place is incredible attention to detail that includes exquisitely recreated costumes architecture and objects from the era you could spend half an evening just reading charmingly written product descriptions and ads in shop catalogs random conversations about jobs and weather overheard from the people you pass on the street and a gorgeously rendered landscape that conveys the ruggedness of the wilds and the sophistication of emerging cities the focus on accurately simulating life in the west might go a smidgeon too far for some players galloping between objectives can take longer than you might like and retrieving resources from slain game is a timeconsuming process but it creates a pace that somehow perfectly fits the game subject and an experience unlike that of just about any other game out there save perhaps the original red dead redemption equal parts brutal and beautiful with a hero both sinister and solemn red dead redemption captures the wild west in all its multifaceted and conflicted glory and in doing so stands as one of the most captivating games yet made for older playersfamilies can talk about the use of alcohol drugs and smoking in red dead redemption the player character drinks to excess smokes to improve his

nintendo switch this is a sequel to bravely default on the nintendo a party of four heroes roams around a fantasy world attempting to thwart a group of evildoers who have stolen several magic crystals and have used them to cause various disasters as the quartet journeys they frequently run into monsters and occasionally people intent on doing them harm which initiates battles in which the heroes and their enemies take turns attacking each other healing and casting various spells characters swing swords and shoot bows causing flashes of light and fire but no blood or gore enemies fall to the ground and disappear once defeated at one point the group runs across a pile of dead bodies with a red aura around them and they also talk at length about the murder of a child and how one villain is using blood to create red paint for his art the protagonists are clearly kind and loyal people who want to support each other save the world and assist anyone in need of help often without resorting to combat some people they aid end up imparting worthwhile lessons about a range of topics including equality jealousy persecution and seeing the good even in those who do bad parents should also be aware that one of the heroes is a borderline alcoholic who talks a lot about getting drinks to celebratebravely default ii puts players in control of a quartet of heroes who come together to help one of them gloria a princess of a fallen kingdom collect a group of magic crystals with the power to cause catastrophe in the wrong hands as they journey they see firsthand how the crystals are being used to bring mayhem to once stable lands including floods in a desert and a town overgrown with a tangle of enormous tree limbs their adventuring puts them in the way of a variety of hostile fantasy monsters resulting in turnbased combat encounters players choose actions for each hero when their turn comes assigning them to attack heal or use magic and items as in the original bravely default for nintendo players have the option of borrowing future turns allowing each hero to act up to four times in one go with various risks and rewards or to store actions for future use and spend the current turn defending each character has a pair of playerassigned jobs ranger white mage thief etc that slowly level up and unlock special powers that can be useful against specific types of enemies more jobs and abilities come available as the game progresses as do new side quests in kingdoms and towns that players have already visited providing reason to return to areas players have already explored and extend the game while gradually increasing the party strengththis very traditional feeling japanese roleplaying game jrpg tries hard to address many of the trickiest and most pervasive problems of the genre while weirdly ignoring others bravely default ii tells a fairly simple goodversusevil story set in a conventional fantasy world with turnbased battles the heroes are charismatic and memorable and the nonplayer characters they meet and attempt to assist suffer problems worth fixing such as a lonely girl who still feels beholden to an emotionally abusive man who helped her when she was down players are bound to care about the game various personalities and will likely feel invested in their stories even if it all feels a bit familiar new and returning fans who enjoy strategic turnbased combat will find plenty to like about the battle system as they tinker with borrowing future turns trying to match up character jobs with the types of enemies they encountering in each dungeon and choosing passive abilities that fit well with their play style it a sophisticated and wellbalanced system that rewards careful analysis experimentation and measured riskthe developers have done a fine job of providing ways players can tweak the game to overcome many of the complaints frequently leveled at jrpgs battles taking too long just crank up combat speed tired of mashing the attack command just press y to order your hero to repeat their last actions bored with surfing menus to use items and magic to heal everyone after each battle just tap x to revive heal and cure the entire party in the most efficient means available at the same time though there are moments of frustration that could have been easily solved the labyrinthine dungeons for example have no maps needlessly forcing players to try to memorize mazes as they deal with branching paths and dead ends and while scores of side quests exist to try to give purpose to the inevitable level grinding required to grow your heroes strength and abilities many boil down to simply revisiting explored locations to find something or battle a specific type of enemy bravely default ii is a fun and polished traditional roleplaying game that works to gently nudge the genre into the present but there still room for growthfamilies can talk about substance abuse one of the characters in bravely default ii

arcade the game is based on the massive star trek universe which has spanned movies tv shows and related products for almost years the game takes place in a new area of space where players discover an anomaly that brings characters from all of the shows together in one place that means that both villainous characters and starfleet officers can fight side by side together as they attempt to escape the dangerous section of the galaxy they in very little of the characters backstories are mentioned or referenced nor is there significant character development or motivation that occurs over the course of the game missions while there exploration and aid given to survivors of attacks the main focus of the game is combat where players and enemies will use melee combat and phasers as well as special abilities to eliminate each other no blood or gore is shown as part of the combat and defeated characters vanish when eliminated while it easy to learn how to play some of the controls for the game aren entirely precise although using a controller solves this issue while there no inappropriate content the game may get players interested in watching star trek or playing games based on the shows and filmsstar trek legends is a new chapter in the longrunning star trek universe and takes the journey to boldly go where no one has gone before in a new direction the story is based around a portion of the universe known as the nexus a strange section of space that messes with the spacetime continuum in other words this anomaly opens the door to alternate timelines strange collaborations between characters that would normally be enemies and other odd events that would seem to be impossible players take charge of the uss artemis a ship specifically designed to voyage into the nexus and counteract its timebending effects but they soon discover that things are stranger than they would initially seem more than characters from the various star trek tv shows and movies such as discovery the next generation deep space nine and others are mysteriously trapped in this anomaly and can be recruited to work on board the ship but you not just going to be fighting battles on board the vessel instead legends focuses on away team adventures where you send down a squad of four to a planet on these missions you take on enemies gather supplies and save other characters cleared missions will allow you to resend shuttles to those locations for additional gear and latinum legend form of cash you also have the option to take on other players in fouronfour matches and can join alliances to boost the elements that your team can earn will you be able to help the artemis escape the nexus or will you and your team be trapped in this strange part of space for all timethis roleplaying game lets star trek fans live out their dream scenarios of sending out the perfect away team completing missions and saving the universe star trek legends puts players in the captain chair letting them direct missions to planets and destroyed colonies in an attempt to figure out what happening inside the mysterious portion of space known as the nexus but instead of sending faceless characters or redshirts on missions to possibly be captured or killed you can send some of your favorites from the seven tv shows and the franchise movies that means that you could put picard on a team with a borg maintenance drone or captain kirk with the gorn letting players establish their own dream team squad scenarios each character has unique abilities so you can make a fight easier or harder based on the strengths and weaknesses of your squad while combat is a large focus there are occasional branching paths in missions where you need to make a decision about how you want your team to proceed using their individual skills successful completion of missions provides extra shards of characters that you can collect to eventually recruit them to your ship and gives you the option to send shuttle teams back to these areas to mine additional resources and experience players can also take these teams and pit them against other players squads although this is a limited multiplayer experience without any player interactionit great that a lot of attention is paid to the combat and that it so solid because the story is largely forgettable it more of a way to introduce new characters and scenarios to fight through although the difficulty will spike sharply at moments forcing you to grind past previously defeated levels to earn enough items and experience to strengthen your squad this would be where a freetoplay game microtransactions would force players to spend money to bypass these hurdles but since legends is part of apple arcade you spared this headache the result is that you actually enjoy replaying missions collecting characters and testing new squads by keeping the focus on gameplay instead of microtransactions star trek legends provides an entertaining adventure with beloved characters that should keep new fans and dedicated trekkers entertained for a whilefamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in star trek legends affected by the lack of blood and gore shown in battle would the impact be intensified if the fights were more realistic would that seem to fit the star trek theme or would that feel like it was out of context with the shows and moviesdoes it make sense to have villains and heroes working together without actually mentioning their previous conflicts is this something that works best for fans of a franchise

knights of the old republic is a roleplaying game for the nintendo switch this is a rerelease of a game originally launched in based on star wars lore that casts players in the role of a republic soldier who wakes up to find his fleet under attack by darth maleks sith armada eventually players and their ragtag team will venture across several planets to find clues to a planet that will lead them to defeat the sith or join them in this story and characterfocused game players can be good or evil by choosing their dialogue and whom they align with violence is frequently part of play with characters using lightsabers and blasters to eliminate enemies while there are severed limbs and characters shown being tortured the textures and older visuals reduce the impact of these attacks similarly the option to pause or allow the game to automatically play out fights limits the impact of violence as well players will discover some clubs with scantily clad aliens that they can flirt with and have implied sexual encounters although nothing shown they will also interact with characters that are frequently drunk although they can drink themselves and can inject themselves with stimulants although they won be affected by these items there also hell and damn that can be heard in the dialoguethousands of years before the events of the main star wars films star wars knights of the old republic follows a disparate group of jedi mercenaries droids and aliens who band together to stop the dark lord malek and his sith army from taking over the galaxy from a weakened jedi order and republic the only way to stop this is to travel to several planets and search for star maps thatonce pieced togetherwill unveil the location and route to an ancient space station the sith are planning to use for domination malek originally found this location with the help of sith master revan whom you and your jedi companion bastilla have visions about what happened between these sith what is this space station capable of and who built it what are the pasts and motives of your motley space crew these mysteries guide players forward with a narrative that takes twists and turns with its plot but also has dozens of smallerscale stories along the way that make the planets histories and places come alivewhile this game is widely considered as one of the best roleplaying games and the best star wars game the rerelease leaves a lot to be desired star wars knights of the old republic has every right to claim those titles thanks to its storytelling whether its your party or those you encounter briefly in short quests each character is crafted to have an important role in the overall story that purpose is to challenge players perceptions of morality and political issues by placing difficult situations in front of them from slavery to segregation corporatism to corruption and more characters whom players once thought innocent or situations that once seemed clear cut may not be such upon closer examination knights of the old republic constantly and pleasantly surprises with main and side quests that players will want to explore not so much for their rewards but for the ways these build up the era with a profound understanding of the essence and themes of star warsit helps that this game holds up rather well in spite of its old character models environments and animation each world has distinct areas that make every new planet a fresh sight of creative wonder but navigating around these locations can be a slog on top of the absence of helpful mechanics like fast travel getting around through empty hallways and barren valleys is painfully slow especially when backtracking is involved this isnt helped by the combats shortcomings encounters begin to feel boring halfway through the experience mainly because players can essentially let the game play by itself and if a situation gets dicey players can step in to manually guide which moves and targets their characters will focus on despite these criticisms the sheer breadth of options available to players with weapons force powers and abilities makes good team compositions satisfying to create plus players will only be able to access certain areas or talk with certain people only if they have the right moves or stats even if the game shows some of its age there an uncommon marriage of caring intentionality behind every action and decision carrying narrative weight while the switch port isn without technical issues such as several crashes and choppy framerate drops with larger environments knights of the old republic stands the test of time even if its a bit wobbly in the knees with its navigation and combat the core of its appeal remains as strong as ever with a cast and story that will stick with players if they give it a chancefamilies can talk about redemption if someone has a bad past or has made a big mistake recently how should they make up for these things how should you treat them if they sincere about changing their wayshow do you know when you should follow your heart or the rules is loyalty always a good thing when someone asks you to do something you think is

violent and challenging roleplaying game originally released in and is available for the xbox one nintendo switch and windows pcs players assume the role of a customizable warrior armed with swords and sorcery who engages in bloody battle with fantastical creatures such as skeletons and demons the obscure story provides little in the way of character background or motivation leaving the player to develop the hero personality through his or her actions helping or hindering other players online and assisting ignoring or attacking nonplayer characters some of the game female characters are scantily clad with exaggerated bosoms hidden only by dangling strands of hair parents should be aware that this is an extraordinarily challenging game that demands practice patience and a willingness to fail multiple times before succeedingdark souls remastered is a visually upgraded version of from software original dark souls a fantasy roleplaying game famous for its gritty and challenging combat labyrinthine world design and abundance of secrets it tells the story of a warrior in a world of undead who must fight his or her way through fantastical foes in an effort to somehow end a plague of endless human resurrection the adventure takes place in a series of intricately interconnected locations most of which are now home to demons and lords players are provided precious little instruction or direction and are instead encouraged to explore and experiment on their own sometimes calling on other players for help sometimes fighting off invading players from other worlds to discover how to survive the perilous world of londor this new edition includes the original game lone dlc pack artorias of the abyss which offers additional areas to explore more weapons and armor to collect and a playerversusplayer arena but doesn add any original content instead it lightly upgrades the graphics and makes a handful of socalled quality of life improvements such as allowing players to use multiple items at once rather than one at a time and the ability to switch allegiances to covenants at bonfires rather than seeking out their leaders it also expands online play allowing up to six players to face off against each other and supports password matchmaking making it easier for friends to play togetherit pricey for a remastered game from a previous generation even if it includes a few hours of dlc that once cost extra but this is clearly the definitive version of this classic action rpg while no match for modern graphical masterpieces dark souls remastered looks noticeably better than the original thanks to its higher resolution and steadier frame rate the switch version does have some darker more blurry textures than the other systems because it not as visually powerful as other systems but it still visually striking although no new content been added its collection of small improvements such as an extra bonfire and earlier access to the dried finger item for people who want to focus on playerversusplayer action helps smooth over some of the original game rougher edges and what made the original game so memorable stands the test of time its challenging combat system which penalizes death by respawning all enemies and robbing you of souls collected essentially experience points remains tough but fair encouraging caution strategy and play style experimentation the beautiful and complexly designed world is still satisfying to explore with secrets around nearly every corner and untangling the game dense knot of mysterious items and elaborate mechanics is as deeply rewarding as ever if it doesn feel quite as fresh as it did when it originally launched that only because so many other developers have taken pages from this game book since its releaseall of this said there some missed opportunities for improving the dark souls experience even further many known glitches and cheats remain the occasionally finicky camera is still problematic in some areas especially in tight corridors or when locked onto enemies on narrow precipices plus the continuing inability to pause when playing offline remains perplexing and is bound to cause friction for players whose family members don understand that they can simply stop playing on command without potentially losing a lot of their hardearned progress it frustrating too that finishing the game automatically starts a new game file overwriting your current save and prohibiting access to all of the areas you unlocked until you played through the entire game again still it a treat to be able to revisit this classic and influential roleplaying game on current generation hardware if you fancy a serious test of your gaming skills and patience dark souls remastered won

exclusively for the playstation that set in a world that has largely succumbed to a global pandemic spread by fungal spores that quickly transform people into mindless monsters it focuses on two young women who are tragically obsessed with avenging the people they love but characters come from all walks of life with different beliefs backgrounds races genders and sexualities fighting is brutal and graphic characters faces are strained with anger and fear in closequarters combat that involves choke holds shivs and knives and snapped necks bodies in varying states of decay litter the environment including hanged and tortured victims gunshots and stab wounds result in sprays and pools of blood while the fighting is intense and visceral the primary message is that violence begets violence outside of combat players watch the protagonists engage in loving relationships protect those they care for and make unlikely friends by overcoming preconceived notions of who they are subplots promote diversity in sexuality and gender identity and explore the complex relationships between daughters and father figures as well as the sort of thinking that leads to the creation of military and religious sects in times of crisis parents should be aware too that characters engage in onscreen sexual activity with women shown topless and that two protagonists get high smoking marijuana characters are also shown drinking and drunk dialogue contains frequent strong language including the f wordthe last of us part ii picks up where its predecessor left off with protagonists ellie and joel settling into a safe community in wyoming after traveling across an america that has been ravaged by more than a decade spent suffering a fungal plague but the events of the first game in which joel saved ellie from a group of scientists who wanted to kill her to understand her immunity to the plague and create a cure are about to catch up with them a tragic twist forces ellie and her new girlfriend dina on a mission to seattle where she determined to settle a score with a member of the local militia named abby what they don know is that they walking into an escalating conflict between opposing military and religious factions they go up against not just these two groups but also the fungusinfected zombielike creatures that inhabit the city abandoned streets and buildings these fast and dangerous monsters can often kill with just one strike players have an arsenal of cobbledtogether guns and explosives that they can use to defend themselves they can explore their surroundings to scavenge supplies necessary to craft weapon upgrades and ammunition that provide new strategic options for fighting both human and fungal enemies outside of combat and exploration the dramatic story edges forward through noninteractive narrative scenes that provide insight into the protagonists motives and personalities via conversations and intimate moments with other charactersstorytelling in games simply doesn get any better than this the last of us part ii is an epic emotional characterdriven tale that focuses not so much on monsters or disease but on familiar issues including family love friendship anger and death but the hub around which everything rotates is an urge for vengeance so strong that even the players might feel it even though they know as the protagonists do that it bound to lead to yet more suffering and tragedy even as players engage in the violence to which our heroes seem committed which is brutally intense and often terrifying there an unavoidable feeling of dread and regret do the people we kill really need to be killed what about their loved ones by the end of the lengthy story players likely will no longer want to fight pressing buttons to attack certain characters becomes agonizing once we fully understand everyone pain it a deeply violent game that somehow uses its violence to protest violenceserving to enhance our immersion in this moving story filled with complex characters is the stunningly realized world they inhabit it strangely gorgeous urban streets have been reclaimed by nature in all its glory including animals creeping greenery and rivers and every location we visit from little momandpop shops with broken windows to the dusty homes of families long dead has its own sad story waiting to be discovered through notes artifacts and architecture it easy to spend hours simply exploring the environment starting off looking for supplies and getting lost looking at old posters on walls or working out the history of a ruined wall or collapsed ceiling a more authentic and compelling imagining of a posthumanity planet doesn exist in the world of games the last of us part ii is a decidedly grownup experience packed with horrifying situations adult themes and multidimensional characters with good intentions and tragic flaws but mature players craving an actionpacked game with an emotional wallop won find anything betterfamilies can talk about violence in games is the impact of the violence in the last of us part ii affected by the sheer amount of violence in the game can violence in a game like the last of us

the nintendo switch players take to a variety of courses challenging multiple characters pulled from other mario games or mii characters to see who can complete a course in the fastest time or with the lowest score while it easy to learn how to play the game success is based on timing aim and environmental factors like wind or course hazards competition is the focus here whether it going for the fastest time or the lowest score unfortunately being a good sport is eliminated when your super drives or your attempt to sprint to your ball before others can knock opposing players and their shots out of the way these actions will frequently cause coins to erupt from players but that the extent of the violence in the game and it cartoonish without any blood or gore shown otherwise there no inappropriate content to be foundmario golf super rush is the latest sports game from nintendo taking players to the links of six different courses to test their skill and aim you have the option to choose from one of characters from various mario games with classic characters like mario and peach and less frequently seen characters like pauline and king bobomb stepping onto the course each character has their own stats controlling their activity on a course such as how far they can drive a ball whether to apply spin to a shot or controlling the placement of the shot on the green they also have special abilities such as special shots that will allow them to blast opponents balls out of the way as well as speed and stamina shots that will let them sprint down the course that important because some modes like speed golf will be fastpaced matches against up to three ai or playercontrolled opponents teeing off at the same time in an attempt to get the ball in the hole first this is raised to a more frenetic level in battle golf where players are tossed into an arena with nine holes and the first player to get the ball in three holes while avoiding obstacles wins finally there golf adventure which is a careerfocused mode where you take your mii persona and move from being a beginner in the mushroom kingdom to being recognized as a golf pro across the six courses of the land players will be able to develop their mii stats as they play and once they completed the mode they can also use this skilled player in the other game modeswhile this game doesn automatically score a hole in one the various modes and fastpaced multiplayer sets up a lot of fun on the links if you new to the sport mario golf super rush does a great job of breaking down everything from driving to putting in simple terms with a fairly detailed tutorial this is also supplemented by a golf glossary of terms and a colorful presentation with the playable characters if you count your mii avatar indicating the simpletolearn but hardtomaster nature of the game what really engaging about super rush are the subtle tweaks to the sport that liven up the action for example multiplayer matches against other players or ai characters are just exhilarating in modes like speed golf and battle golf where you try your best to be both quick and accurate in your shots to the cup aside from the pressure as you prepare your shots you have to be aware of incoming rushes from other players that can knock you and the ball out of position charged up super shots like yoshi that can turn your ball into a wobbly egg that won roll straight or environmental hazards like bobombs that will fling your ball off the course it hard not to laugh and get excited during close matches when you see a friend just miss a shot giving you an opportunity to sink a putt and win the gamesuper rush isn perfect though for example while the golf adventure mode had promise it essentially devolves into a tour of courses with a few tricks thrown in this could been a deep mode where you develop a character build a friendly rivalry or even select a character to explore the kingdom but instead much of the significant plot development is abandoned shortly after the first course another issue with this mode you can make your mii characters more powerful than the provided mario universe characters thanks to the leveling system you can have someone that drives farther than bowser is faster than daisy and has more stamina than donkey kong and you can bring them into other game modes when you done the upside is that these superpowered mii matches in multiplayer take a hectic game mode and turn it into minigolf chaos which is very amusing finally super rush would really stood out with a course editor that friends could use to design new holes and tournaments to play and share with friends there are only six courses included in the game and after a couple of playthroughs you learn the hazards for each which further drives home how vital multiplayer is the negatives are minor gripes though for a fun golf game that a blast to play with friendsfamilies can talk about the appeal of sports games what makes sports games so compelling is it the challenge to master the sport the test of skill against another opponent whether it controlled by a human player or the computerdoes it

made exclusively for the nintendo switch this is the latest game in the longrunning minigame franchise and features characters from previous installments in the series it also features a number of minigames based on other nintendo games like the legend of zelda metroid donkey kong and others while there are some combat sequences with characters shooting at enemies or hitting targets no blood or gore shown as a result plus the short nature of each minigame and their cartoonish looks limit the impact of any violence also there one minigame where you try to cover a person up before a fan can blow their towel away but otherwise apart from potty humor with poop or things like sticking a character up a nostril there nothing inappropriate in the gamewarioware get it together is the latest game in the longrunning franchise wario has gathered his crew of friends at warioware inc to develop a game collection that will take over the top of the sales charts but surprisingly the game suddenly runs a major bug that sucks everyone at the company into a console scattering them throughout the newly designed levels it up to players as wario to explore and succeed at each game in the collection to save his friends uncover the cause behind the glitches and escape the console before it too late players will make their way through more than different minigames each with their own goals like avoiding incoming attacks moving from one side of the screen to the other or freeing trapped characters something that unique to get it together is that players will be able to use the special abilities of wario team to succeed in their tasks like leaping onto the ceiling or tossing a boomerang to clear targets as you clear more stages the speed of each game accelerates as well forcing you to get quicker in your movements one to two players can hop into the story mode to clear stages or they can dive into the variety pack to take on one of separate minigames for up to four

from its digital fatestretch your fingers and get ready to react quickly because this collection of minigames will test your reflexes against a ton of crazy goalbased scenarios warioware get it together builds on the format of the franchise providing more than different bitesized scenes to play through in seconds or less figuring out what you need to do has always been the biggest trick with warioware games and this is no different in fact this actually takes on a higher stake when you add in the individual abilities of each character there are almost two dozen characters included in the game each with their own special abilities that change how each minigame is played for example if you have a character than can fly crossing a stage is much easier to do than a character than can only use rings to cross areas that makes it even trickier to get used to every single element for every single game as a result once you unlocked everyone you probably find the characters you really like and use them over and over again potentially expanding out to other characters if you feel like itthat not to say that there limitations here there a ton to do especially as you unlock additional play elements in fact there more of a reason to explore and hop back into previously played minigames thanks to the missions feature which gives you specific goals to complete in order to earn credits which can be used to continue playing sessions or purchase items to level up each character in the playopedia this is a fresh way to keep players active and engaged especially if they feel like they may be bored with some minigames the same could be said about the wario cup which will update on a weekly basis with new tests for you to accomplish for a top score on a leaderboard and for bragging rights amongst your friends less impressive are the variety pack games these are fine if you playing with a few friends once or twice but these solo games don feel as impressive random or engrossing as the random nature of the games in the story mode if you put this mode to the side though the fastpaced nature of get it together is sure to keep you blasting jumping and flipping through minigames for weeks to comefamilies can talk about the appeal of minigames does warioware get it together appeal to a wider number of gamers because it has a variety of activities to engage in or is it tailored for a smaller audience looking for shorter bitesized gaming sessionsis a game that relies on fast reflexes based on skill instinct or both can you train yourself to become better at these games or

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/metroid-dread,Metroid Dread,parents need to know that metroid dread is an action adventure game exclusively for the nintendo switch this chapter in the longrunning metroid franchise is a direct sequel to metroid fusion it features series hero samus aran fighting against an alien threat that could once again destroy all life within the galaxy this is a challenging game players will be hunted in some areas by relentless robots while fending off alien attacks from all sides players will also have to contend with puzzling out how to navigate an alien world that restricts access based on the equipment they have available at that time and hides pathways to others behind hidden blocks or walls fighting through some opponents particularly during boss fights requires precision moves and accurate shooting to be successful and will frequently take multiple attempts to conquer players will use missiles lasers bombs and other attacks against a variety of aliens and with the exception of some green liquid that looks like alien blood in some scenes no blood or gore is shown enemies vanish when they defeated in battle leaving behind resources for samus to use the game supports amiibo figures sold separately which can be used once a day to replenish energy or missilesmetroid dread is the latest chapter in the longrunning scifi franchise the story takes place after the events of metroid fusion with the galactic federation receiving a mysterious message claiming that a dangerous parasite known as x is thriving on a planet known as zdr the discovery of this creature is alarming because samus aran the legendary galactic bounty hunter had supposedly eliminated the last of the x on her last mission the federation dispatches a group of robots known as extraplanetary multiform mobile identifiers or emmi to investigate whether this report is accurate or made up but shortly after the robots land on the surface they stop transmitting leaving the group completely uninformed about what happening the federation tasks samus with investigating zdr discovering what happened to the emmi and eliminating any potential threat from the x before it can escape the planet and infect the galaxy unfortunately for samus shortly after she arrives she attacked by a mysterious warrior that steals all of her gear and abilities leaving her vulnerable to the planet indigenous life forms even worse she finds herself hunted by the emmi as well it up to samus to complete her mission and survive at any cost to do so she need to explore every region of the world acquiring replacement skills and gear to replace what she lost can samus uncover what happening on zdr and prevent the threat of the xthis game mixes fastpaced action and suspenseful chase sequences into an incredibly engaging tale but its challenge will keep players on the edge of their seat like previous games in the franchise metroid dread takes samus aran to a new planet where she faces a new and extremely dangerous threat it holds onto the classic formula of the series with samus needing to explore the world to get new abilities as a result you frequently backtrack through areas once you gotten a skill gaining access to new areas that you were previously walled off from this places a different spin on the area of the world you in because the map tends to change based on the actions you perform to get these items for instance changing the flow of lava that opens some doors and blocks off others forcing you to take a longer path through some sections but dread cranks up the intensity by placing the virtually indestructible emmi robots in the game to actively hunt you down in each location their inclusion basically turns these sections of the game into a horror movie with a killer that relentlessly chasing you down until it catches you or you escape the only way to survive is to find and acquire powerful energy sources that let you supercharge your arm cannon so that it can melt their protective armor and then fire off a charged shot or run as quickly as you can these sequences especially with cutscenes detailing your success or failure are very striking especially when viewed on the switch oled screen their sharp clarity adds to the tension as you eventually try to turn the tables on your pursuer it clear why this game was released on the same day as the newly launched system it showcases the visual fidelity of the machine beautifully and justifies an upgrade or outright purchase of the new switch to experience the game the way it intended to be playedbut the intensity of these sections highlights one of the play elements that can be problematic which is that dread is a very challenging game whether it trying to counter an emmi when it catches you you get a narrow chance to escape if you caught which isn easy to do or defeating the many different boss creatures scattered across the planet you need fantastic aim and precise timing to avoid incoming strikes this isn always easy to do and you need to replay sections and fights multiple times before you learn enemy patterns and that on normal difficulty the hard difficulty is even more intense this gets even harder when you also realize that there are plenty of sections that hide access behind hidden blocks and exploding walls you may run past the location you need to get to because you being chased or can immediately see which way to go and will spend loads of time running in circles searching for the right way to go so while the vibrant colors of the game and the incredible dark shadows pop out on the switch oled screen they can also serve to add to your confusion especially in a chase sequence when you looking for a way out and the thing you need to destroy fades into the background but this adds to a pendulum feeling in gameplay which is that you can feel incredibly stuck and frustrated until you figure out what you need to do or where you need to go then once you acquired the next upgrade you feel incredibly powerful enough to demolish sections you were previously trapped in this backand forth friction keeps play incredibly exciting and helps to drive you forward through the story which has plenty of twists and turns for a sequel especially within the closing chapters hopefully it doesn take another years to get onefamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in metroid dread affected by the fact that you blasting alien creatures instead of people would the impact be

enhanced play and new features for fans of the national pastime along with a visual overhaul of players and stadiums the game has received notable adjustments in timing for fielders and batting this year your reaction to a hit ball is vital thanks to the first step system which gauges whether you be in the best position to deny a ball from going over the fence or missing it entirely this is paired up with an extreme catch indicator which determines whether you make those sportscenterworthy plays or watch as your fielder eats turf with the ball bouncing away a new optional throwing meter allows you to preload throws to simulate the splitsecond reactions needed to make double plays or toss from the outfield to the plate to rob your opponent of a run for batters there a new hit mechanic called perfect perfect which gauges your timing and aim to send the ball screaming into the outfield or out of the stadium road to the show has received new challenges during games enhanced friendship and rivalry bonuses and accurate minor league rosters for aa and aaa teams march to october has enhanced the scenarios you face throughout the season including the option to call up specific players from the minor leagues and a trade hub to respond to the needs of your team over the course of a season there also a new mode called showdown in diamond dynasty where you draft a squad of players and pick perks to enhance your team you then play specific challenges in an attempt to win new players before facing off against an ace pitcher win and you get bigger rewards lose and you ejected from that set of missions entirely and will have to start all over from the beginningthis year chapter of baseball gets you as close as possible to the game without sitting in a stadium mlb the show is the sharpestlooking baseball game ever as players look closer to their real counterparts than ever before and for the first time real minor league rosters are included making the journey of athletes from minors to majors more believable similarly tweaks to the fielding and batting system just feel right you can rely on your outfielders making mad dashes and snagging fly balls now if you don make a good first step in the right direction you going to give your opponent extra bases even better is the new perfect perfect batting system which gauges your timing and aim on a pitch when your timing is just right the ball soars through the air from the whip crack of the bat it doesn guarantee that this ball will be a home run but it sure gives you a jolt of excitement when your player drives the ball during a key moment speaking of key moments the new showdown mode takes this concept and raises it to a tense fever pitch becoming easily one of the most engaging modes that the show and arguably many sports games has had in years draft a team from a handful of players and choose a set of perks to enhance your squad from there play through scenarios like avoiding strikeouts or getting on base a certain number of times failing gives you no help while successfully completing these tasks lets you draft additional players and gives you points toward a showdown against an ace pitcher from a major league team here you receive a set of outs like or as you try to score more points off this hurler than his team has win and you can continue for additional prizes but fail and you have to start over from the beginning considering that some showdowns cost ingame currency to enter each atbat feels vital and important every swing and pitch excitingall of this being said some elements should be sent back to the minors for instance the preload pitch timing meter is supposed to capture the splitsecond decisions and reactions necessary to make throws but it fills up way too quickly resulting in far too many wild throws even with practice if you looking for extra challenge you can turn it on but it much better if you leave this feature in the dugout another issue some sections just feel stale while road to the show has tweaked the relationship features between teammates and rivals the story of your created player has been the same for years now and show veterans know the sequence of plot cutscenes in their sleep similarly the booth commentary feels stale and outdated using many of the same phrases in a series of games so onthefield action doesn seem that dynamic but overall mlb the show is still full of great features that will easily rally baseball fans to cheer for its gameplayfamilies can talk about consumerism do you feel pressured to spend your money on ingame packs in mlb the show to give your created baseball teams an advantage or would you rather earn new players by playing multiple baseball gamesdoes playing this game make you interested in playing or watching baseball in real life what about learning about classic moments of the sport do some of the modes get you interested in fantasy baseball drafts could it make someone who isn a fan of baseball become a

madden nfl tries to present a realistic version of the sport from injuries to play schemes for situations on the field players who aren experienced or who are looking for a lighter more arcadelike experience can find that in the game as well violence is part of the game and the sport and players will get bruising hits when being tackled but no blood or gore is shown injuries may occasionally be seen as a result of collisions there no inappropriate content included in the game although unmoderated multiplayer could expose players to comments from other players there are some team logos and endorsed logos on stadiums that can be seen in the game as well as gatorade and microsoft surface tablet branding on the sidelines but there less advertising in this year title than in previous versions players can also spend real money to buy packs and items for the ultimate team mode to boost and enhance their playermade squadsmadden nfl takes players back to the gridiron for another season of pro football with a handful of new game modes face of the franchise returns this year with a new storyline anchored around a hall of fame player looking back on his career ranging from when he takes over his high school program as a quarterback from a rival who becomes his best friend it moves to him being forced to change his position to wide receiver or running back in college and his eventual span of time in the nfl aside from this mode and the inclusion of the standard franchise mode there are two new game modes superstar ko and the yard which are more in the arcade direction of play superstar ko lets you draft players from a pool of nfl stars to be the standout players on your team as you have one drive to try to score a touchdown on your opponent if both of you score you given three plays to see who gets the most yardage in a tug of war mode succeed and you get a chance to draft another star to boost your squad the yard by contrast lets you take a playercreated athlete onto fields around the world as you play six vs six matchups against other athletes based on challenges at each location finally the ultimate team mode returns with new challenges new boosts to player cards and a refined system to keep players interested in building their ultimate fantasy team the playstation and xbox series xs version of the game features enhanced load times as well as new game day cinematics a revamped play calling system and nextgen stats that tracks things like a player acceleration yards after the catch and the time to a sackthis year installment of football places a larger focus on arcadelike play than on traditional football which is fine for newcomers but hardcore fans may be disappointed madden nfl two newest game modes the yard and superstar ko have games that can be completed in less than minutes for fans who want a quick hit of football the yard is like a pickup game where you take the position you want to play on both sides of the ball and try to complete challenges it even feels like playground rules down to a rush or pass timer virtual one mississippi counts before defenders can go after qbs that is if the playground happened to be in locations like the parking lot of lambeau field if you want higher stakes including poweredup cards for your ultimate team superstar ko lets you draft nfl stars to see if you can stop opponents from getting into the end zone on their turn and then try to score when you on offense the tension ratchets up when you tied with an opponent and stuck in a tug of war battle to see who can gain the most yards in three plays because the winner moves on but the loser has to start over from the beginning it the closest thing to resurrecting ea fan favorite nfl street franchise ultimate team has also received some upgrades such as cleaning up the card interface and adjusting how you can upgrade players it mainly similar to last year mode but it much easier to dive into and understand for newcomers while still offering a lot of variety of missions and challengesface of the franchise returns and while the story interesting it still falls short it clever to have a player that already a hall of famer talking about their career from high school through the pros to a member of the press there even the twist of learning a new position which happens to some players in college but many characters and decisions feel thin and not fully fleshed out for example your high school teammate that set up as a frenemy disappears once you turn pro although he supposedly playing in the league as well what worse is that it ties into the franchise mode once you get to the pros but virtually no updates or changes have been made from last year game which is disappointing the same disappointment can be said for the x version of the game which sports minimal visual and onfield updates it should be expected that the game would have sharper graphics and faster load times to take advantage of the hardware and it does in fact the players look better than they ever have and their animation looks tighter than ever before the version of the game also has a nice extra bit of pop thanks to the haptic feedback of the controller so when you launch into someone with the hit stick you feel that pop but while the addition of the nextgen stats to provide extra details on the play is nice it feels tentative whenever it run you shown a precanned camera sweep down the line and a little hesitation in the video before the clip and stat are presented it not as dynamic as the stats that pop up in broadcasts and isn as effective as you want it to be once the novelty wears off and while the nextgen version has clearly fixed some of the visual bugs that plagued the older version the limited revamping of the play calling system isn enough to provide significant depth on either side of the ball all in all you can help but feel that this year arcadefocused madden is rebuilding towards next year seasonfamilies can talk about marketing to kids madden nfl packs in product logos and even pushes for some ingame purchases for ultimate team why is this just a way to get more money out of playersdo you think that madden nfl could get kids interested in playing football or watching the game in real life instead of sitting in front of a screen could the tutorials and lessons found in the

character displaying grit and resolve through their heroic actions multiplayer modes encourage a sense of teamwork as well as friendly competition dialogue includes infrequent mild profanity while combat is fairly straightforward though often challenging parents and players should note that many of the systems governing activities such as crafting leveling up and working on side missions are complex and can take quite a while to understand and master they may require searching for help outside the game in wikis and online community forumsdestiny the witch queen is a paid expansion that adds a new campaign and plenty of changes to game systems within destiny it brings players face to face with sevathun a complex and terrifying antagonist previously mentioned but never before fought in earlier destiny campaigns a god amongst the hive one of destiny chief antagonistic groups sevathun has found a way to control the light a power that until now has been wielded as a weapon only by guardians the warrior avatars controlled by players savathun has somehow bestowed this power upon her own soldiers giving them not just powerful attacks but also the ability to be brought back to life via rebel ghosts those little floating balls that usually only accompany guardians that have taken up with the hive beyond the new campaign which is set in a colorful new throne world filled with new areas to explore and tasks to complete the witch queen also provides a new legendary difficulty mode that ups mission challenges while promising greater rewards adds a variety of new weapons and armor including the ability to craft a powerful customdesigned glaive weapon using a special forge an epic new multiplayer raid mission dubbed the vow of the disciple and a new activity called the wellspring that has players either attacking or defending the titular area players can also engage in competitive and cooperative multiplayer combatthis may be the best expansion yet released within this franchise destiny the witch queen provides an expansive series of missions that at least for those who follow the series often murky lore delivers an emotional narrative from the player ghost who is genuinely shocked and disturbed at the thought that some of his brethren may have sided with the hive to savathun herself whose complicated motives and objectives make her a villain players can at least appreciate if not actually sympathize with there more to each quest than simply going to waypoints and shooting everything you see bungie has also attempted to bring added variety to campaign missions introducing puzzles and platforming challenges between combat encounters and while these new elements are a mixed bag jumping around platforms in a pitch black area by shooting timelimited light emitting spores on the wall is often more frustrating than fun they do at the very least make for a nice change of paceit all built on destiny peerless firstperson shooting mechanics weapons feel fantastic and can be upgraded in all sorts of creative ways by embarking on side missions collecting various resources and taking the time to learn the complex but satisfying new crafting system which allows you to customize weapon mods stats and shaders the glaive in particular is a very compelling new weapon capable of both melee and ranged attacks powerful enough to defeat even some of the game tougher foes with just a few good wellaimed strikes but it worth noting that while destiny veterans are by now used to the intricate systems used to create and upgrade gear and weapons and should be able to adapt to these changes without too much trouble players new to the series who jump in at this point are bound to be at least a little overwhelmed by the vagaries and intricacies of how everything works expect a long slow learning curve the good news though is that the fighting is never anything less than a blast which should help make the learning a little less of a slog destiny the

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/nintendo-labo-toy-con-vr-kit,Nintendo Labo Toy-Con VR Kit,parents need to know that nintendo labo toycon vr kit is the fourth installment in the cardboardtoy franchise thats exclusive to the nintendo switch players will use premade sheets of cardboard and digital instructions to build a range of controllers such as a camera pedal and a blaster pistol all of these are used with the included vrvirtual reality goggles that are constructed which allows the switch console to project movies and games in a vr mode this is the first labo kit that has been broken up into separate experiences so players that arent too sure about the vr play can purchase a starter kit and add on extra controllers as they want or purchase the full kit and get everything in one pack the controllers are responsive and the games are somewhat easy to play although some coordination can be slightly complicated with some projects like the elephant device also because theres no headstrap for the visor holding the cardboard and switch tablet can start to feel a bit heavy and awkward after a while especially for younger players theres no inappropriate content in the game and while you can smash cars with mallets shoot ufos or aliens and other combat in minigames theres no blood or gore and targets blow up in puffs of smokethe nintendo labo toycon vr kit is the latest installment of nintendos toyminigame collectionprogramming studio for the nintendo switch while the previous kits in the franchise explored a set of vehicles as well as well as toys and robots this kit takes players farther into the virtual world than before the base of the kit is a vr virtual reality goggle headset with lenses which are then inserted into a variety of cardboard peripherals along with the joycon controllers in the full kit theres a camera an elephant a wind pedal bird and blaster waiting to be created as well as a snorkel and pinwheel addon items each one lets you play with two separate game experiences such as photographing fish flying around an island as a bird or blasting aliens with a powerful gun players can also head into whats called the vr plaza which is a collection of more than minigames that show off how flexible the kit and labo hardware is of course like the previous labo games you can program your own games or enhance the experiences of the games in the vr plaza thanks to its suite of programming commandsthe newest vr kit for young gamers proves that you dont need to have a superpowered pc or headset to have an engaging virtual experience like the other labo kits the strength of the nintendo labo toycon vr kit is grounded in the peripherals that you construct from sheets of cardboard the key one is the vr goggle headset which is quick to fold together and has a surprisingly good set of lenses to reproduce vr effects this is vital because unlike the other labo kits you cant dock the switch and experience the vr on a tv you have to use the goggles in the headset to explore this environment compared to other low powered vr headsets like the swarm of google cardboard knockoffs that hit the market a few years ago these lenses powerfully amplify the content from the switch well there are moments where the depth can feel a bit off when youre trying to focus on objects on the edges of your vision especially if youre sitting down but for the most part its impressive this is reinforced by the peripherals which maintain labos legacy of solidly built controllers that can withstand a lot of play for multiple hours without feeling like theyre going to fall apart the blaster is a particular standout because cocking the gun and firing it with one button press feels better than some devices that are more expensive on other systemslike the other labo kits the main play experience tries to highlight the strengths of each controller most of the games are quite good such as the camera games where you photograph fish or aliens the zooming in and out has a great tactile feel thanks to a click wheel embedded in the device whats also great about the vr kit is that when you get tired of these games you can check out the vr plaza that has more than minigames that show off what the peripherals can do as well players that have a creative side can dive into the included vr garage and either edit these games or make your own that helps to really extend the life of this vr pack farther than the first two labo packs if there a negative its that theres no strap to help players particularly younger ones hold the device if you have a young kid with small hands trying to hold the goggles or a peripheral with the switch inserted for a long time can be tiring for them while it might be possible to modify your labo to include straps this is one of those things that nintendo really missed on fortunately the game does try to remind you to take breaks frequently so you dont get too tired but its something to pay attention to for little gamers this issue aside if youve been on the fence about vr gaming you may want to give the nintendo labo toycon vr kit a try it may turn you into both a labo and a vr fanfamilies can talk about screen time cardboard models in the nintendo labo toycon vr kit can take a while to complete so should you take breaks between steps as the software recommends is there a reason that you would ignore breaks when building the kits do you think its wise for the software to recommend taking breaks when playing the games or viewing content in

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/first-class-trouble,First Class Trouble,parents need to know that first class trouble is a downloadable social deduction party game for playstation playstation and windows pcs players are assigned as either a human resident or a robot called a personoid on a highclass spaceship residents try to accomplish tasks and find key cards to safely proceed from area to area and personoids attempt to blend in among the residents to sabotage or kill them before they reach the final goal personoids can kill residents in numerous ways and bodies are left behind after being killed but the deaths are all cartoonish and no gore shown while the text is simple and easy to understand unmoderated voice chat is an important part of the game and is on by default because of this players can be exposed to potentially offensive language and commentary alcohol and tobacco feature prominently and player avatars can engage in drinking and smoking players can choose to purchase dlc downloadable content packages that provide cosmetic items and outfits but no items that affect gameplayfirst class trouble is a six player social deduction party game set in a spaceship being attacked by a rogue artificial intelligence named cain four residents of the spaceship try to find keycards to make it to the center of the spaceship where the ai waits while keeping the ship oxygen levels up and resolving other emergencies two robots controlled by cain called personoids here attempt to blend in with the residents to sabotage their efforts if the residents discover the identity of the personoids and make it to the center of the ship they win if the personoids can kill all of the residents or convince the other residents that they are part of the group long enough to reach the center of the ship themselves they wina great setting and lots of interaction with other players helps this party game stand out from other social deduction games but you got to figure out how to play it first first class trouble has a very thin plot to explain what happening a rogue ai is draining the players spaceship of oxygen and needs to be stopped but this is more set dressing than a real story each round sees four players chosen as residents who try to reach the center of the space ship to shut down the articial intelligence named cain while two other players are designated as personoids who try to blend in and sabotage the residents efforts the resident have two goals they need to acquire three key cards from each level and make it to cain while keeping the oxygen levels high enough to make it to the end without dying and they need to figure out who among them are personoids the personoids have a more tricky role to play as they need to either kill all of the residents or successfully make it to cain having convinced the rest of players that they are a resident this is a fairly common setup for a social deduction game but first class trouble introduces several mechanics to add wrinkles to the gameplay the personoids have very few ways of directly killing players and have to be creative to elimate residents they can spread fires to block exits attack with singleuse syringes trap people in freezers and push people into pools to directly remove other players or try to do tasks poorly to slow down play long enough for the residents to run out of oxygen for their part residents can find log books that give clues on who among the other players may be a personoid thanks to these added complications rounds can play out a variety of ways especially if everyone playing is fully aware of the mechanics and is taking advantage of the system quirksvisually the game is fairly basic but the art style and highclass cruise ship theme of the spaceship go a long way for building a unique identity the lack of photorealism also helps diminish the brutality of the kills carried out by the personoids making them seem purposefully goofy and cartoonish no individual action is particularly challenging but there a lot of information to keep in mind and aside from some helpful tooltips the game doesn do a great job of teaching you how to play this means there a bit of a learning curve as you stumble around trying to figure out how things work and look extremely suspicious in the process voice chat becomes necessary to make out everything that happens which puts your experience in the hands of other players a good group can have plenty of humorous moments and tense rounds and an unpleasant group will lead to boredom and frustration very quickly but when everything lines up well first class trouble is an engaging and silly party game that worth giving a shotfamilies can talk about violence in games does the cartoonish nature of the violence in first class trouble lessen the impact on young players does playing as a personoid make the violence feel more real since the player is the one doing it considering that teamwork is the other way to win does the game say anything about how working together is more important than getting your way through violencehow does working together with fellow players in first class trouble help in accomplishing your goals how does it feel when players that say they are working with you sabotage your efforts to helphow does the presence of alcohol and

investigation with the onset of horrifying nightmares and the realization of having missing memories players will go down a rabbit hole of discoveries and unravel truths that will have them questioning reality itselfwhile this mystery looks amazing it gameplay and story is anything but martha is dead makes a stunning first impression with its graphics the italian setting is lovingly crafted to emulate its time period with architecture and artifacts players not only control handheld film cameras telegraphs and rotary phones but also are informed of how this technology worked in that era there a commendable attention to authentic detail and atmosphere but beyond the presentation problems arise everywhere else it packed with simple fetch quests that involve little to no critical thought puzzles are stumbled through with ease rather than actively solved players take and process photos with elaborate processes which is admirable in its realism yet remains more like a chore than a clever or fun part of gameplay to solve mysteries and lean into the horror in fact martha is dead has no frighteningly good scares or tension despite its promising setup instead relying on gory imagery and distressing themes for unnecessary shock value that doesn meaningfully contribute to the story professed themes and purposeif the characters and plot were engaging the gameplay issues could be overlooked but martha is dead ranges from erratic to droning in pacing lengthy awkward animation characterizes cutscenes and player actions along with painfully slow and sometimes unskippable monologues and dialogue to sit through the story is hard to follow with a main character who drastically shifts in her motives and moods randomly and while this attempts to capture dissociative identity disorder through play this intention falls apart with a story where truth and reality are impossible to discern with issues that can just be chalked up to an exaggeration of the main character condition here lies a bleak meandering tale with a frustrating lack of focus martha is dead may look impressive but its promise is buried in boring gameplay and a confused storyfamilies

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/fifa-21,FIFA 21,parents need to know that fifa is the latest chapter in the long running soccer franchise for the playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs nintendo switch and windows pcs the title keeps the focus from the previous two year titles with a street soccer element bolstering the professional soccer league gameplay there a hefty amount of promotional material for companies thanks to the many billboards around arenas as well as the logos on player kits or uniforms that can constantly be seen in close up shots and replays the game also sold in three separate versions each of which provide varying amounts of content for the ultimate team mode the ultimate team mode also allows players to purchase credits for this mode through the store using real money or lets players earn it by competing in matches by themselves or with other gamers online which can be redeemed for new gear athletes and items online play is unmoderated which could expose players to inappropriate content but otherwise there nothing offensive to be found within the gamefifa is the newest chapter in the soccer franchise which attempts to bring both the street and professional club focus of the world most popular sport into one package building on the foundation of older titles fifa now boasts more than teams in more than stadiums more than leagues from around the world and more than players like many sports games there a number of enhancements that have been made to this year game volta the street focused version of fifa now allows players to hop into games with friends quickly thanks to the volta squads which lets you team up with four other players to take on opponents players can also explore a quick prologue in the streets in the debut a mode that introduces a squad of players hoping to make a name for themselves on the global stage of street ball players can even recruit some star athletes in the featured battles mode the everpopular ultimate team returns with the ability to build teams of your favorite players this year players can also build and customize their own home stadium establishing everything from team chants and anthems to the color scheme of seats tifos and celebratory fireworks career mode returns letting players build a created athlete from a promising prospect into the star of a club or lets them step into the shoes of a manager running the club from the sidelines plus there are a number of additional gameplay adjustments such as enhancing your dribbling moves letting players decide when to direct teammates to sprint towards the goal or get open for a pass and adjustments to defensive play the playstation and xbox series xs versions feature enhanced graphics along with new cinematics of players arriving at stadiums or walking through media zones and faster load times there are also new celebratory cutscenes after goals a new camera based on tv broadcasts and for owners haptic feedback through the controller gives feedback during the game for tackles shots and as your player tires on the pitcheven though there are some tweaks that have been made to the gameplay it hard to not get over the feeling that this is practically the same experience as last year fifa presents three distinct segments of gameplay with its career ultimate team and volta modes but these are almost identical to last year title there are slicker overlays for menus and tutorials and a larger focus on coop play across virtually all modes but for the most part gameplay the same as it been in the past few years for example the career mode has some new visuals for managers to sim matches but in many ways the player and career mode have the same schedule micromanagement skills games and gameplay by contrast the adjustment to volta the street game feels anemic because its storyline is at best about three hours long before you essentially pushed into the action of online play or trying to hunt for athletes in the featured battles mode to add to your squad while completing challenges to unlock new clothing options for your teamat least play on the pitch has some improvements that are pretty useful players can now directly control teammates making cuts towards the goal allowing them to create their best attack scenarios with strikers or wingers there also been some additional tweaks to ball control thanks to the new agile dribbling system which makes it easier to make cuts and keep the ball away from defenders while these two enhancements do improve the gameplay this along with new crossing options for the passing game imbalances the action significantly towards the offensive side of the ball leading to a large number of goals being scored it not perfect both your players and the opposing ai will still cause a significant number of offside calls to be made when they starting their attacks but defenders often have to rely on the perfect tackle or the best player having the best position to effectively counter incoming strikes on goal ultimate team has also received new adjustments as well especially in the form of a customizable stadium that will allow you to build out your home arena chants tifos and even celebratory fireworks even better than crafting your home stadium is the elimination of some elements that just weren useful like training and fitness items that just felt like a chore for this mode that way you can focus solely on building your squad partnering with other players and accomplishing seasonal goals it still the mode that most players will dedicate the majority of their time to and there lots of content to sink into unlock and play the nextgen versions of the game are visually striking with the almost nonexistent load times and visual fidelity of cutscenes standing out especially if you score a go ahead goal in the last minute of play and you watch your team erupt in celebration but playwise there nothing new here the haptic feedback on the is a nice touch particularly when it comes to having a sense of a shot that clangs off a post or you feel the heartbeat of a player as they running but if you were looking for new gameplay content there nothing to be found which feels like a slight incremental update to this popuilar franchise overall though while fifa is still a fun and enjoyable chapter of the beautiful game it hard to not shake the feeling of dj vu when you step onto this virtual pitchfamilies can talk about consumerism in fifa which is full of branding including logos billboards and broadcast graphics is it ok that the publisher makes money from gamers and advertisers too is product placement harmfulis it worth it to buy an annual sports game if the developers release a free downloadable update to account for changing team rosters do you really need to buy one every year can you skip a year or two or do the new features and better graphics justify the purchase does it help that console gamers can get an upgrade to the next generation system for free,en,484.0,Positive

and heart and intense thirdperson gameplay and it a stellar example of technical prowessfamilies can talk about whether kids should play an action game like ratchet clank rift apart is it safe since it clearly a fantasy cartoon adventure and purposely overthetop or is it no better than more mature games since ratchet uses weapons and can draw blood from enemies is there a differencehow important is it that players get to assume the role of a male and for the first time in the series a female character too will gamers enjoy controlling ratchet and rivet how important is it for disabled gamers

city and former gang member carl cj johnson in grand theft auto san andreas who takes on various missions performing jobs for those in the criminal underworld in large and interactive fictional cities namely liberty city vice city and san andreas respectively which are based on contemporary new york miami in the and san francisco los angeles and las vegas in the played from a thirdperson

from the era they based on with humorous radio banter with djs as well as commercials players will meet and often work with or for seedy characters many of whom have a backstory and connection with other characters and events in these individual gameswhile these are some of the best examples of interactive entertainment the medium has ever seen this collection has also been marred with technical issues and other problems grand theft auto the trilogy the definitive edition titles provide exceptional storytelling open worlds that makes you feel like you can do what you want in any order and live vicariously in these fictional bustling cities you can hop into vehicles in total in grand theft auto vice city alone such as sports cars motorcycles boats planes and choppers and hear great music have a laugh with silly commercials and disc jockey chatter meet memorable characters in many locations and engage in hundreds of primary missions and side quests for a thrilling taste of underground adventure the controls are tight and responsive the graphics are impressive and there a ton of content to keep you entertained for several months on end the acting is also great which is often rare for video games in grand theft auto iii for example the many cinematic cutscene sequences are very well done with more than recurring characters and voice talent is provided by hollywood celebs such as joe pantoliano kyle maclachlan and michael rapaport in grand theft auto san andreas there are also familiar celebrities samuel l jackson peter fonda james woods and george clinton to name a fewbut because of the mature content it strongly recommended parents don allow young kids tweens or young teens to play these raunchy gory titles and not dismiss them as just games there a lot of adult themes here including sex along with murder drugs and very strong language in the dialog and lyrics these remastered versions do in fact look better but there have been many issues with this remastered collection on windows pc players who paid for the set were unable to play due to rockstar launcher issues and for all versions these three games have been filled with bugs visual glitches freezes and crashes problems with frame rates weather effects and more to make matters worse the pc version was said to still contain code from the grand theft auto san andreas hot coffee easter egg controversy with a deleted but still accessible interactive sex scene along with some developer comments and other issues such as some songs that were presumably cut over licensing restrictions perhaps these reasons were tied to the game being temporarily pulled from that platform this is all too bad as rockstar games had a chance to rerelease three of arguably the most significant games in a generation for a whole new generation to enjoy as well as enable fans of these instant classics to enjoy them all over again with better visuals and revamped controls on modern systems hopefully these issues will be eradicated quickly so that they don mar the exceptional work on the originals and give these games a welldeserved new life on today techfamilies can talk about whether grand theft auto the trilogy the definitive edition would be as fun without all the controversial content isn it exciting enough to race around a busy city hop on foot to complete missions and travel back to your home base is the inclusion of the violence sex drugs and profanity what makes grand theft auto games so specialwhat are the redeeming qualities of the games in the grand theft auto the trilogy the definitive edition some grand theft auto games let you run your own businesses to make money so isn that positive what about the fact that they like an interactive movie with well thoughtout dialog

windows pcs the game is set in the and is filled with gory murder scenes disturbing narrative threads about cults and madness and terrifying lovecraftian monsters that have tentacles bizarre limbs and incomprehensible heads players fight these creatures and the occasional human using guns and melee attacks and encounter scenes of carnage in which people have been hanged shot or carved to bloody pieces but most of the game is spent exploring the city and investigating cases players take on the role of a navy diverturnedprivate detective who uses a mix of sleuthing abilities and supernatural senses to piece together what happened at murder scenes track down missing people and discover the town darker secrets the game fantastical plot also touches on social allegory delivering commentary on racism and prejudice through fictional characters with physical characteristics that make them stand out the player has the ability to make certain key decisions that will alter the story such as whether or not to believe that a suspect was out of his mind when committing a crime and whether that should affect his responsibility for his actionsthe sinking city is set in a small american coastal city that has experienced a bizarre flood and is now cut off from the rest of the world creating an isolated community in which money no longer has meaning and strange nightmarish creatures roam abandoned streets and buildings players take on the role of a private detective who has arrived in the city by boat looking for answers to the strange visions that haunt him and which he worries are proof of madness he quickly makes himself of use to the locals including a wealthy family and the local hospital solving mysteries by combining his sleuthing skills he brilliantly observant and an ace at honing in on relevant information in stacks of files with newfound paranormal abilities that allow him to see visions from the past and put together chronologies of events based on limited evidence his history as a navy diver also comes in handy as he journeys to the seafloor to unravel what happened to a research team and finds clues as to what may have caused the city mysterious and enduring flood players are free to explore the city as they like pinning locations of interest on a map by studying clues in notes using boats to navigate flooded avenues and defending themselves from both monsters and men via a modest arsenal of guns and limited ammunition which can be crafted from scavenged resourcesthe key to enjoying this atmospheric horror adventure is to set and manage your expectations of your experience in this nightmarish town the sinking city was clearly developed by a small and passionate team with a grand vision and limited resources resulting in a game that can frustrate as much as it entertains for example the city of oakmont is satisfyingly large and stylized evoking an authentic vibe infused with eerie tinges of horror and weirdness but it not nearly as detailed as the open worlds players have seen in many other games and many of its inhabitants feel much more like lifeless automatons than real characters they spout the same lines over and over and heedlessly walk into walls and cars the action is a similarly mixed bag with competent but lackluster gun combat simplistic crafting mechanics and derivative sleuthing sections that involve finding and organizing clues these things have been done significantly better in games with bigger budgets that allow for more nuance and complexitywhere the experience begins to shine though is in its storytelling the writers have created an engaging world full of riddles begging to be solved and mysteries in want of answers what caused the flood where did the creatures come from is there any connection between the city cults why do so many people share the same dreams is our hero going mad or is he simply gifted even when the game limited budget shows itself in the story characters don always have a sufficient stock of lines to create smooth and useful conversations we still left with the desire to know more which should prove enough to keep players who enjoy cryptic lovecraftian horror stories playing through to the end the sinking city is a game that wants to be more than it is and while the seams show it hard to fault it for tryingfamilies can talk about violence in media is the impact of the violence in the sinking city affected by the fact that you fighting monsters most of the time instead of people is the impact intensified because you frequently see scenes of blood and gore would the impact be changed if you were mainly facing off against people instead of creatureswhy do the genres of horror and science fiction serve as such effective mediums to communicate important messages about our world is there something about these genres that sums up these messages easier than commentary about the world problems,en,429.0,Positive

lord the player freely roams the land on foot and horseback looking for demigods in possession of the ring shards but defeating these powerful enemies is no small feat along the way to each boss players will encounter many challenging enemies that must be overcome via skillful application of melee and ranged combat tactics this involves switching between swords shields bows and other armaments as the situation demands learning how to effectively block dodge and parry incoming attacks employing stealth if at all possible and knowing when you met your match so that you can beat a hasty retreat and live to fight another day death results in a temporary loss of all accumulated and unspent experience points and these points used to upgrade the hero base stats making them stronger

can increase their odds when facing down tough foes as a last resort you can summon other players to your world to help defeat especially tricky bosses but be wary because multiplayer can also be competitive with other players invading your world to attack rather than help youit a bit reductive to suggest that this is just a dark souls game set in an open world but when you get right down to it that exactly what it is elden ring preserves just about everything that from software fans love about the studio games including a punishing level of difficulty ambiguous yet weirdly compelling storytelling the ability to leave messages for other players and help strangers having a tough time and a host of mysterious artifacts the purposes of which need to be gradually riddled out through play at times dark souls players will feel like they simply playing a sequel in that series as they tread cautiously through dark towers they peer around corners heart pounding looking for hidden enemies that can kill in just one or two swings of their massive swords and hope to spy a save point where they can safely spend all of the experience points they accumulated before dying and losing them all the fighting is tough but it also fair especially once you mastered various skills and attacks and gotten to know your enemies patterns and the reward is that taking down harder foes carries with it a sense of accomplishment not felt in most games players are forced to earn their victories and that means something in other words it largely business as usual for a from software gamethe big change of course is that these familiar features are set in a sprawling more or less ungated open world that players can freely explore but whether this open world makes for a better experience than the dark souls games which feature meticulously designed and mostly linear environments is an open question the freetoroam world adds elements novel to from software games such as the ability to summon a steed to get around a little more quickly and fight enemies from a mounted position which can be a real advantage in some battles there are also changes to the purpose and type of enemies encountered for example you find easytodispatch animals all over the world and may be tempted to simply ignore them but skillfully dispatching an entire group will refill your restorative health flask without forcing you to find and use a save point which would respawn all the enemies you defeated tactical consideration is built into everything but do these modifications improve upon the traditional souls formula from software trademark nonstop intensity is significantly ratcheted down when roaming about open spaces where it easy to escape or simply avoid most enemies and the exquisitely handcrafted labyrinthine environments the studio is known for are limited to keeps caverns and dungeons found within the open world these don make up the bulk of the game which may disappoint some in the end elden ring knows what it wants to be and it fully embodies that game players will need to determine for themselves whether it an improvementfamilies can talk about violence

management game for windows pc xbox one xbox series sx playstation and playstation it casts players as the leader of a colony of people who have survived a catastrophic event that has left the world in ruins under your management and according to your decisions the colonists cooperate with and help one another on various scavenging and building projects to create a happy healthy community with housing crops water and medicine unfortunately they will sometimes be beset by bandits they fight back with various melee and projectile weapons if they can struck by disease or fall unlucky victim to natural disasters these events can leave colonists sick injured or dead the action viewed from a raised threequarters perspective and there no blood or gore though dead bodies can lie on ground for days as they await disposalliving in a postapocalyptic america is no easy task or at least so it would seem while playing surviving the aftermath a strategy management game that tasks players to create a happy healthy resilient community after the fall of civilization the game begins with players basically designing their own catastrophe a creative way of determining the game difficulty since you be forced to deal with the consequences your choices such as resource shortages bandits and world toxicity then it time to set up camp and start building you begin with just a few colonists wandering around the village looking for ways to be helpful and you need to guide them to build shelters collect water and food and gather resources such as wood and plastics eventually your colonists will have children and welcome in stragglers who happen across the community increasing the community needs but also adding to available hands as the town grows you be able to build better facilities to treat injuries and diseases and harvest resources more efficiently but you also need to deal with marauding raiders and random disasters such as meteor strikes and pockets of radiation key to survival is sending the camp handful of specialists out into the wider world where they search for technology and resources to bring back to the community your primary goal is simply to survive but along the way you reach a variety of milestones that act as proof of your ability to weather an apocalypseanyone who reckons themselves a wise leader and savvy survivalist is in for a rude awakening here surviving the aftermath starts off easy enough with your little band of colonists casually walking around gathering wood digging wells and building tents survival appears to be strenuous though not particularly difficult work but as you soon learn you never more than a single disaster away from your community collapsing a plague could decimate your population in a matter of days if you don have proper medical facilities debris falling from the sky could wipe out half of the houses you built or depraved bandits could target your town for a raid it all but impossible to defend everyone under your stewardship from every possible threat so you need to make the best decisions you can with the information and resources available knowing full well that it only a matter of time before some calamity leaves your community roads filled with dead and dying citizenssome of the game most interesting moments come when you forced to make surprisingly personal decisions will you welcome newcomers even if you don currently have enough housing for them will you indulge an unhinged colonist belief that he stirred vengeful spirits in one of the houses he scavenged will you punish the community funstarved kids for stealing muchneeded resources to build a fort these choices have consequences that could impact the camp fortunes more than that they combine to form a picture of who you are as a leader what risks you take to protect your people and what shenanigans you allow to take place to increase the camp livability and happiness this isn the type of simulation game that overwhelms players with technologies to learn and structures to build but rather is more concerned with creating an organic and dynamic narrative in which you feel connected with your little band of survivors as they experience various trials and tribulations while you do your best to rebuild a civilization founded on determination amid inevitable compromise surviving the aftermath tells players the apocalypse isn something to fantasize about but with prudent decision making some people might just be able to live through itfamilies can talk about screen time progress in surviving the

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/star-wars-the-force-unleashed,Star Wars: The Force Unleashed,parents need to know that much of the gameplay revolves around combat but there no blood or gore and you fighting primarily against alien creatures or faceless stormtroopers however the fighting is relentless thus garnering the t rating and our age recommendation of the game raises interesting moral issues as you must decide whether you are an evil sith or a good jedi since you are required to play part of your time in the game as an evil sith kidfans of the star wars movies may have trouble with the mandatory killing of many of the good characters they have come to love including wookiesstar wars the force unleashed takes place in between star wars episode iii revenge of the sith and star wars episode iv a new hope you play as a lightsaberwielding apprentice to darth vader but as you unravel more of the story key players and locations you might choose to become a noble jedi knight instead of an evil sith the game begins on the wookiee homeworld of kashyyyk as seen in episode iii but also takes players to the junk planet of raxus the floral world of felucia a tie fighter construction facility and more players will meet and interact with new characters designed for the game as well as familiar faces from the films in fact you get to play as the sith lord vader during part of the gamealong with its stunning widescreen highdefinition graphics on the xbox and playstation the game excels in how you use your learned force powers specifically the developers at lucasarts did an extraordinarily good job in making players feel powerful thanks to superhuman abilities including the ability to push around huge objects without touching them or damage things by emitting lightning blasts through your fingertips players can also combine these rewarding powers for a dramatic effect such as using a force grip on someone neck lifting them in the air and then zapping them silly before tossing them into a nearby tree the xbox and versions of the game play exactly the same but the nintendo wii version lets you swing around the wireless and motionsensing wii remote and nunchuk to pull off the lightsaber moves and force effectsone of the key problems with star wars the force unleashed however is its linearity players are on a pretty tight leash as they navigate these indoor and outdoor levels and can veer too far away from your path how amazing would it be to have some openended levels such as a grand theft auto sandbox game where you left to explore your surroundings this drawback can also hurt the game replayability other issues are the lack of a multiplayer mode and a pc version of the game plus the thirdperson camera can sometimes obscure your view instead of providing a cinematic perspective of the actionif star wars the force unleashed was rated by special effects alone the scifi adventure would garner unanimous praise by video game reviewers but as with some criticisms of the iconic feature films not everyone will find substance underneath the style but it sure is a fun ride and one that star wars fanatics will revel in as they appreciate its gorgeous graphics and impressive physics effects while turning a blind eye to the game shortcomings visually speaking the xbox and versions are much better in highdefinition than the wii and handheld versions of the game an iphone version is also available at the apple app storefamilies can talk about how you can be good or evil in this game how did you decide which to become this game is not unlike many of the star wars movies big on production but light on story are we more forgiving of a star wars adventure in this regard than other video games based on movie franchises or do video games really need depth also what did you think of this game linear path would you have prefered a more openended experience,en,329.0,Positive

who sails across the sea from europe to a mysterious island in the atlantic home to monsters and magic once there they join countless other players who have arrived and set up settlements with an aim to tame the evil forces that inhabit the land so they can make new homes and fortunes for themselves as in most mmorpgs players spend much of their time completing an enormous array of quests which include fetching items killing monsters running errands and meeting new nonplayer characters among other activities when not in battle players will be engaged in crafting tasks which require collecting resources and ingredients by chopping down trees mining ore hunting animals and harvesting plants then using the proper facilities to refine the raw goods into materials that can be used to make armor weapons jewelry food potions and quest items virtually every action players undertake will improve one or more of their avatar skills and new quests recipes and abilities are unlocked as these abilities grow while the vast bulk of the game can be played alone some enemies are much more easy to deal with when adventuring with a larger group of players and many activities require banding together with members of your chosen faction sometimes taking on other players in battleamazon game studios has sort of just remade the wheel with its first major mmorpg but it done so in striking and effective fashion new world is sprawling and polished set in a stunningly detailed world and loaded with complex intertwining systems that virtually guarantee you always have multiple quests on the go new abilities you just unlocked and want to experiment with fresh gear to craft and new achievements to earn it a fastpaced nearly neverending feedback loop of tasks followed by rewards when exploring the world you rarely more than a few yards from a resource or animal that can be harvested and landmark locations teeming with enemies are everywhere there so much to do that it easy to be torn between quests and jobs and wind up sidetracked doing something other than what you planned players are free to swap between weapons and gear at will which means they never locked into a specific role or class and are generally allowed plenty of freedom in how they want to play a handful of important features are missing at launch such as mounts getting around aeternum can take quite a while on foot and native support for gamepads but these are likely to be added over time via patchesbut new world will live or die based on its community the good news though is that it seems players are remaining enthusiastic and engaged wars between factions the push and pull to wrest control of settlements and the drive to band together in companies to take on some of the game bigger challenges appears to be keeping players involved and happy to communicate and work together creating their own metanarratives atop the game official stories this community is bound to be what drives any longterm appeal new world may possess but those interested in simply playing for the story amazon has created are perfectly capable of doing so since playerversusplayer activity needs to be opted

commonsensemedia,2022/05/04,https://www.commonsensemedia.org/game-reviews/battlefield-2042,Battlefield 2042,parents need to know that battlefield is a first person shooter for playstation playstation xbox one xbox series xs and windows pcs this is the latest version of the longrunning military shooter franchise and takes players to a variety of battlefields as their teams attempt to accomplish various objectives before their opponents can gameplay also features maps and modes from previous games in the series such as battlefield bad company and battlefield combat is the point of the onscreen action and there no shortage of violence as players use knives guns explosives vehicles turrets robots and other means to eliminate their enemies while bodies are flung into the air landing awkwardly on the ground upon impact and blood is frequently shown as players are shot turning the screen red there no gore shown during play the multiplayer is unmoderated which could expose players to all kinds of inappropriate comments but that raises a particular issue with its current state the game fosters teamwork but doesn come with voice chat relying upon third party communication for player coordination this coupled with technical issues and server instability could significantly frustrate players that are trying to play with friends or other gamers players will also face a challenge in trying to accurately and effectively shoot and use their skills in the heat of battle while fending off ai and human enemiesbattlefield is the latest chapter in the longrunning first person shooter franchise and takes place in the future in a world that engulfed in crisis climate change has resulted in the first category six hurricane which devastates north america this storm is followed by global food and fuel shortages massive wildfires across europe that can be contained or prevented and the collapse of the governments of several countries as a result more than a billion people find themselves displaced and turned into refugees without a home leading to a new faction of civilians and soldiers known as nopats after a disaster in space destroys most of earth satellites leading to a loss of communication navigation and information the us and russia quickly move towards war using nopat soldiers as their warriors to claim dominance over the remaining resources players will select from one of ten separate specialists all of whom have their own special abilities like hacking deploying turrets or charging with ballistic shields these soldiers aren restricted to specific classes such as assault or medic nor are they restricted to specific weapons players can customize their character loadouts and gear to suit their play styles before deploying them in three modes to explore in this pitched multiplayer experience there allout warfare which is broken up into two separate modes conquest and breakthrough conquest gives both sides respawns for each side as they fight for control of objectives the team that holds all of the objectives or eliminates their opponent lives completely wins the round breakthrough by contrast gives a team on offense lives respawns and tasks them with taking each objective in a zone to be successful thereby forcing the defending side to fall back for reinforcements fortunately for the defenders they have unlimited lives so they can try to wait the enemy out or launch counter attacks on incoming troops to eliminate their chances of success there also a squadbased mode called hazard zone where fourplayer squads are sent into locations with the goal of retrieving as many data drives from satellites as possible and making it back to an extraction point before time runs out of course every other squad has the same goal in mind meaning that they will hunt down ambush and attempt to kill players as they trying to get on the few transports remaining which can lead to tense firefights as the clock winds down and the zone becomes unstable as long as one player of a team makes it onto the transport the entire team gets away with the drives they acquired which results in credits to unlock stat bonuses and additional gear finally there the portal mode which allows players to play rush from bad company where attackers try to arm and destroy objectives in a base before defenders can stop them or conquest from battlefield or players can also take elements from battlefield games and create unique game modes to fight across thanks to a webbased programming system allowing virtually limitless levels for the community up to players can play on or xbox one and up to players on windows and xbox series xsthe skeleton of multiplayer fun is clearly visible in this installment of the popular shooter but technical issues and missing features cause more misfires than accurate shots on its targets battlefield starts off with a futuristic premise that builds off the gameplay from battlefield but the story is largely forgettable it more of a justification for why there are tornadoes wrecked ships melted polar ice caps and more affecting some of the game maps and why everyone willing to shoot everyone else this revamped take on combat extends to characters as well because you now using specialists instead of soldier classes each with their own unique gadgets and abilities as well as the option to adjust your weapon loadout to suit your playstyle for instance you could choose to play boris as a sniper but place his sentry gun down to cover him from any enemies that try to sneak up on him as he aims at his targets not being tied to a class means that anyone can step up and perform the job of virtually any other soldier on the field which seems appropriate given the chaotic setting of that can give you an extra rush of adrenaline as your squad goes charging towards an objective during a match of breakthrough and you relying upon the aim and support of your teammates to secure an objective or you in a pitched match of conquest trying to squeeze out a victory from your opponent as allies are falling all around you from incoming fire it also a lot of fun to dive into user created game modes in portal one stand out was a zombie mode against waves of computer controlled opponents that demanded accurate headshots to eliminate the attacking bots it was exhilarating engaging and felt like something that could be played for hoursat least it would be if the game was stable enough to play for that amount of time battlefield is plagued by tons of technical problems that can make the game unplayable chief among them are connection issues that can prevent players from even connecting with ea servers to play the game itself assuming that you can get past the loading screen there no guarantee of game stability because players are frequently ejected from squads during loadout screens deployments or in the middle of matches players have loaded into new matches with the servers considering their player automatically dead preventing them from spawning into the match and forcing a restart during some play sessions with other writers the game even crashed xbox series x systems turning the systems completely off but moving past all of the hardware issues there are other problematic items in gameplay such as characters that go sliding for yards across the map during a running crouch instead of a few steps or characters that are launched far in the air or through walls hit detection can also be questionable as players can unload half a clip into some enemies without them falling even dozer riot shield was so overpowered that it had to be disabled because it made him invincible but perhaps the biggest and hardest issue to understand is the omission of voice chat within the game for player interaction and coordination voice chat is literally a standard for multiplayer games and isn just expected it required for a teambased game to help players coordinate their tactics and ingame actions but for a squadbased mode like hazard zone which is dependent on communication between teammates for players to be successful excluding chat isn just a mistake it virtually makes the mode unplayable that a bitter pill to swallow especially for players that have spent for the ultimate edition of the game sure if you playing with friends you can possibly set up a group chat on discord it awkward especially if you not playing on pc but it can be done on the other hand if you randomly paired with other players it doubtful that you just going to set up a random group chat for gameplay that isn stable to begin with that not to say that this is the final word on battlefield it clear that the devs are working on fixing bugs and problems and it still very early for the title as well for example the voice chat is supposedly one of the first items on the list to be addressed but right now until a number of these issues are fixed players have to be aware that battlefield is a bit closer to a minefield of tech problems than a fun session of multiplayer matchesfamilies can talk about violence in video games is the impact of the violence in battlefield affected by the fact that you may be attacking and destroying turrets vehicles or robots instead of humans does the impact intensify when you fighting and killing human controlled opponents is that impact affected or lessened when you attacking soldiers that look human but are controlled by ai within the gamehow vital is teamwork within battlefield do you think there should be a way to coordinate multiple squads for effective attacks against enemies is there a way to transfer the teamwork and coordination learned in this game to other games or to real
