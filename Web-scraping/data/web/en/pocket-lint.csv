it?,pocketlint if you a gamer then the chances are you heard of ray tracing but you might not know exactly what it means or why it a big deal we here to help you find outnvidia has been pushing ray tracing since it first announced its rtx graphics cards in but ray tracing is much more than just a marketing ploy to help sell graphics cards for highend gaming pcsand hardwareit a developing technology for enhancing the visuals of games that results in a much more immersive eyecatching and visually pleasing gaming experienceray tracing is actually nothing new it been around for years now but it only recently that pc hardware and technology has got to a point where ray tracing can be implemented in a way where it can make a real difference to your games in realtimein its simplest form ray tracing is a system that used to enhance the lighting in games this is done in a variety of different ways it used in everything fromreflections to shadows both in the gaming environment and on items within it this includes things like atmospheric effects reflections on surfaces water metal glass and even diffused lightingdiffused lighting is especially interesting as that includes light bouncing off of surfaces and reflecting onto others this in effect is an indirect lighting source that then helps create a more realistic experience imagine how sunlight falls into a room then bounces off walls and floors and naturally makes the entire room brighter that one part of how ray tracing workswhen ray tracing is fully implemented you often won even notice what happening unless you paying really close attention as it part of the whole picture of a graphically stunning environment it only when you see a sidebyside comparison of the games with ray tracing on and off that you see what a difference it can makewith the latest and greatest nvidia graphics processors all this happens in realtime this helps generate highresolution realtime reflections that reflect details in front of behind above and below the player or camera details the player couldn see with previous techniquesas well as reflecting light shadows and environmental highlights the ray tracing system can also add impressive visual effects to characters within the game and even the items they carryingthink about the reflections of a sword blade or player metal armour showing the surrounding world with a mirrorlike effect but realistically reflected and in realtime changing as the character moves and passes through the game worldthis demo created in the unreal engine shows many of the nextgeneration rendering features possible with the tech the effects in this demo includeusing this technology in rendering lighting and creating visuals developers are able to create uberrealistic gaming experiencesit will certainly be interesting to see how this tech progresses in the near future we already had a taste of what the future of gaming might look like and ray tracing is yet another stepping stone in the right directionwhen ray tracing was first announced it was only open to gamers with the latest nvidia graphics cards in their gaming machines only the rtx cards were capable of supporting ray tracing and dlss although that list included the nvidia geforce rtx and it was hardly an extensive onethese graphics cards are also expensive and put ray tracing out of range of most gamers unless they were willing to splash out for cuttingedge techthis all changed in april when the company announced that older gpus would support ray tracing with the latest gameready driversfor some this means that ray tracing is enabled via software level directx raytracing dxr rather than at hardware level but it gives more users access to ray tracing visuals you can find out more about this hereand so the current list of older raytracing capable graphics cards includesit not just gaming desktops that support ray tracing either laptops with equivalent pascal and turingarchitecture gpus are also included in the listthere also quite a list of gaming laptops with rtx gpus included as a specification option that list is constantly growing tooray tracing isn limited to pc either thexbox series xandplaystation both have some support for ray tracingall that said it worth noting that if you want the best experiences with ray tracing then you need the best hardware although older graphics cards now support ray tracing they will struggle with performance old gtx gpus can only offer basic ray tracing effects with a low ray count while rtx graphics processors can manage much more complex effects with multiple effects being presented with a higher ray countray tracing is also a graphically intensive process with it turned on and settings maxed out even the highestspecced gaming pcs can see a dip in performance in terms of frames per second displayed on the screenbest games amazing playstation titles to pick up by max freemanmills may get a visually stunning gaming experience but it won necessarily be an ubersmooth one nvidia even shows the impact maximum settings can have on average fps at various resolutions and even at x these figures are around on older gtx gpus so it worth splashing out for rtx graphics cards if you can afford itthe newer rtx series graphics cards see notable improvements in performance even with ray tracing turned onsupport for ray tracing depends greatly on developers implementing the effects and visual enhancements as they crafting their gamesmany of the supported games are triplea titles that have also appeared on console but without the same visuals the original list of games that supported ray tracing was fairly short but it constantly being added toit helps that nvidia and intel have been working to standardise the vulkan api in order to make it easier for game developers to add ray tracing support to their games in the future this will also mean that ray traced games should more easily make their way to the new consoles with the same support in futurebattlefield has all the good things from nvidia ray tracing dlss and nvidia reflex too so not only will the game run well and look great if you have the right hardware you be able to get the competitive edge toocyberpunk might have had a rough start and a bit of a difficult launch but if you have the right hardware you can take advantage of the superb raytracing capabilities for some seriously awesome views in night cityfortnite now has ray tracing support along with dlss to help with performance improvements this means fortnite players can now enjoy

playstation was first released of storage seemed ample it soon turned out not to be however with game file sizes expanding at a fair rate of knotsnow years later games like call of duty warzone can easily top that doesn leave too much space on your default drive for many other gameseven if you have the enhanced version of the or the pro each with drives they will struggleluckily there are two options for increasing the storage space on your or pro one is blindingly simple the other slightly more complicated they both work very effectively though and aren too easiest way to increase the storage of your whether it be the original model refresh or a pro is to add a usb hard drive to your setupany usb drive will do the job and the supports drives up to in sizewe chose a dedicated edition of the seagate game drive with of space it great value at under and is designed to match the perfectlyanother great alternative is a wdblack game drive which is specifically designed for gamers and costs only a little more for up to you choose to get it work with your just plug it into any of the three usb ports we chose one of the rear ports to tuck it out of the wayyou then need to head to the settings menu in order to format the drive to work as external storage head to devices then usb storage devices you should see your new drive listed on the next screenclick on it and you will be taken to a page with a box that says format and extended storage click on that wait for a short while and bingo the drive is ready to usethe will automatically set your external drive to be the default to install games onif you want to use your internal drive instead go back into the settings menu head to storage and press options you will have the option to choose between the internal and external drive as the game installation locationanother way to expand the storage of your is to replace the hard drive inside the machine it not as complicated as it sounds and could be ideal if you say want to add a solid state drive for speedier accessyou will have to take at least part of the console apart sony makes it very simple for you but you will still find the process a little longwinded the easy part though is choosing a drivethe uses a sata hdd the type of which you find in a laptop however not any old drive will work to fit a it will need to be no greater than in depth or it will be too big forthe hard drive enclosure drawerthere are some out there that will meet the specifications at around the mark we opted for a western an older blue drive with a depth which fits nicely but there are plenty of more recent sata iii alternativesyou can even opt for an ssdhdd hybrid drive such as the seagate firecuda gaming drive that on amazon uksome have also suggested pure ssd equivalents which ramp up load speeds dramatically but can be prohibitively expensive if you trying to increase storage rather than shrink itinstalling a hard drive is a lot more time consuming than increasing the storage via an external solution the will take a bit more to get up and running which includes having to back up files as you have to completely start afresh once the new drive is in placethe files that will need to be backed up are games saves and any video clips or screenshots you wish to keep you can do the former in a couple of waysthese new keyboards by logitech have our favourite emojis built in and we love them by pocketlint promotion may you are a playstation plus member you can upload all of your save files to the cloud ready to download again when you done in fact if you had already set this up to happen automatically you needn bother yourself with this part of the process again if you haven and have a fair few games this can take a whileif you aren a playstation plus member or wish to keep a more local copy of your saves you will need a usb memory stick or ironically an external hard drive formatted to fat or exfat standard to store data on plug it into the through one of the front usb ports and get ready for a laborious processhead to settings application saved data management saved data in system storage and you see copy to usb storage device go into that menu and you see a list of all your games enter each one individually and you can tick the files you want to copy and confirm the files will instantly be copied onto the external drive or uploaded to the cloud if you go through that routealso remember to back up your captured videos and screengrabs from the capture gallery section of system storage management and once you have you ready to install the new drivemake sure you completely power down your not just into rest mode and then unplug it from any of the wires at the back put the console on a flat surface and then slide off the hard drive casing it shouldn be difficult to do but does vary in location from the original latest and proinside you gain access to the hard drive enclosure which is fixed in place with just one large screw with the playstation symbols on it undue that with a phillips screwdriver and you can slide out the existing drive using the small handleunscrew the four black screws two either side of the hard drive enclosure leaving the rubber holders in place then remove the drive that came with the it with the new drive and screw the black screws back in placeslide the drive back into the console until it feels like it has attached properly and screw it in place using the large playstation screwclip the lid or flap back into place and that part of the job is doneas the console now has a brand new drive with none of the system software installed you need to reinstall it manually you definitely need an external usb drive or memory stick on at least in capacity for this part of the setup even if you stored all of your saved games in the cloudcreate a folder called on the drive using acomputer then a folder inside that called update you then need to download the latestsystem software file from sony and be wary of following some links on the playstation site as they can send you to earlier versions that won work you just get an error message when trying to installthe latest system software at the time of writing is version which we found here at playstationnet it will be around to download but is the complete software not just an update if the file is much smaller it the wrong one and won workmove the downloaded file named to the update folder on the drive and you ready to install it on the consolereattach all of the leads into the rear of the plug your usb drive into the front and attach a dualshock controller via its own usb cable then press the on switch on the front of the machine for seven seconds or longer this will boot up the console into safe mode and give you some options choose initialise reinstall system software and the will find the update if the correct one and install it it only takes around five minutes in total and then your will reboot and start up as if it has just been unboxed and set up for the very first timeof course you then have to reinstall everything again and sign into your playstation network profile but at least you have much more storage space than when you startedas we opted for a drive much like the one that came with the machine in the first place we not really noticed much of a performance upgrade on the internal drivewe weren aiming for speed though for that you can opt for a drive instead if you willing to splash a little more cash and just having that extra storage space is making a big difference to our gaming livesif we being honest you best advised to go down the external drive route considering that dead simple and relatively cheap these days but if you really want to beef up your system you might want to add a new faster internal drive too at some point,en,504.0,Positive

PS5,pocketlint the playstation has been out for well over a year now and it still as hard to find in the shops as anything you can name such has been its popularityit easy to see why it is resplendent in its skyscraper looks and boasts true nextlevel technology but what exactly can you do with it other than play gameswe put together a handy guide for anyone who has recently bought a or the digital edition here are the best tips and tricks we foundif you already own a playstation and want to set up your using existing settings and installed games you can transfer files from your to the new via your local networkyou will need the latest system software on both consoles so make sure they are updated first you will also need to ensure your trophies are synchronised by pressing options when viewing your trophies and selecting sync with playstation networkyou now need to set up both of the consoles for the transfer you can either do this by connecting them both via wifi to your home router or via lan cables the latter is definitely fasterif you only have one lan cable make sure both consoles are connected via wifi to the router then plug the lan cable into each console ethernet portonce connected turn both on and head to your settings tap on system then system software and select data transfer hit continueyour should appear on the next screen select it and as soon as prepare for data transfer appears press and hold the power button on your until you hear a beepyou can then select all the content you wish to transfer and select star transferthis might seem an odd tip but if you stand the standard playstation on its end something that it clearly best designed for a disc doesn go into the drive in the most natural directioninstead you need to face the top of the bluray or game leftwards and towards the meat of the console itself some might say that obvious but it wasn for us the first time aroundif you have your laid horizontally it makes much more sense as the disc inserts the right way around with the disc slot at the bottom of the console it is also irrelevant for digital edition owners of coursethe lets you create global settings to choose defaults on new games as you start them a handy feature this means you can tell games to always use their performance modes for example if you prefer higher frame rates or to choose the medium difficulty setting when you startto choose your settings go to settings then save data and hit gameapp settings under the game presets section you can choose the default settings you want to use most games should recognise these but you may have to doublecheck before you get too far inif you playing a game from a little while ago and want to avoid seeing images from later sections as you browse your cards and pages there a handy setting to help where you edited your game presets under gameapp settings you can also see a section about spoiler warningsyou can then block either any images the developers have flagged as spoilers or any images from areas you not seen yet both are great ways to steer clear of new information the good news is that the game hint cards you see when you press the playstation button on your dualsense controller will abide by this and won show you any spoilers eitherthe playstation has its own optional media remote to control streaming apps and bluray playbackthe bluetooth device is easy to pair with the console you just have to head to settings then accessories scroll down to media remote and tap on set up media remotea wizard will guide you through the steps but to put the remote in pairing mode just hold the playstation and options buttons down for a few seconds the remote can also be set to control your tv and as in our case a sound systemin the early days of the it was surprisingly fiddly to make sure you were playing the nextgen version of a game where both versions were downloadable this has thankfully been fixed by software updates you now see a logo next to the game on your homescreen to let you know which version it isif you accidentally got the version installed you can just go to your library and download the option instead also sony has ensured that when you buy a game it be the nextgen version that automatically downloads which is usefulif you already have a decent library of games assigned to your playstation account or have downloaded several of the ps plus collection but want to just see what games you own that are native titles you can filter the listhead to the game library icon in the top bar on the homescreen and click on the filter button on the lefthand side has a downward arround on it select platform then tick your library will now just show games you can do the same for other platformsafter months of waiting sony activated the ability to accept an additional internal ssd to get more storage for your games and applications the process is really quite simple but you can find a full guide on how to accomplish it right hereon top of that we also got a carefully curated list of the best internal ssd options for you to pick up so you can make sure that you don get fleeced by an overpriced drivewhen you have an external drive plugged in and active you can move games and apps from the internal drive to the external onefirst head to settings scroll down and click on storage then click on console storage move across to the games and apps tag and click on thatselect the items you can move tag at the top of the next page click on any of the games you wish to transfer then hit movethe does not support dolby atmos as such but can output bitstream audio over hdmi for dvds blurays and blurays so your av receiver surround system or soundbar can decode the signal itself the only issue is you have to choose the option manually and it not available in the usual settingsbasically you can only do it when a disc is inserted and running when it reaches the main disc menu of the movie or tv show hit the options button and you should see a few popups appear at the bottom of the screenselect the burger icon the three dots and then settings in the next menu that appears select audio format then

pocket-lint,2022/05/04,https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/news/138270-best-pokemon-go-tips,The best Pokemon Go tips and tricks,pocketlint the basics of pokemon go are simple and fun you walk you catch pokemon you collect as many as you can and you visit poke stops to load your backpack up with goodies to help your trainer along the waybut when it comes to mastering the game there a lot more you need to consider here are some top tips to help you become a pokemon prothe eggs you collect at poke stops or get from gifts will help you get some pokemon as well as gain xp and boost candies once you put them through an incubator and walked the required distance or everyone starts with an infinite use incubator with an symbol on but sometimes you be rewarded with incubators as well as being able to buy them in the shop use them wiselyusing this technique you get more efficient use of those incubators also watch out for special events where hatching distances are slashed generally speaking the longer distance eggs have greater rewardsthe skill of your trainer is dictated by the xp you have you move through the levels of xp needing more xp each time to level up but as you do so the rewards get higher and you evolve and hatch pokemon at a higher level as well as being able to powerup to higher levelspoweringup your pokemon when your xp is low means it costs you more candies to do so so it better to save your powerups of pokemon until you reached a higher xp level like over level help build xp quickly try some of these thingsthere are two areas of the game that register the pokemon you catchthere no need to carry every type of pokemon as a growing collection in your bag that what the pokedex is forit better to keep only the pokemon you need that an army to fight with in gym and raid battles you need high power versions of pokemon but it better to have a number of powerful blissey than one blissey and a caterpie metapod kakuna and so on because those pokemon once registered and evolved won really do much for you so learn your pokemon skills and build an army of those who fight well like gengar blissey vaporeonyou also need to carry those you still need to evolve and hang on to those who need a special item to evolve like onix if you not yet got steelixalso keep your eye out for special edition characters like the seasonal pikachu these evolve into special raichu so it worth having and holding these just so you can put them in gyms for others to be jealous ofthere an option to transfer pokemon to the professor in return for candy of that pokemon variety having captured a pokemon and got the stardust and candy they bring you can then transfer out pokemon you don needif for example you already have rattata you can probably swap some for candies to power up those who will actually battle for you as raticate as we said above you can only carry a finite number of pokemon and you want them all to be powerful so get rid of those weaker specimensthe pokedex shows how pokemon evolve and it worth checking out what a pokemon can evolve into before you drop candy on it to power it up or evolve lesser forms for example if you have lots of pidgy and a few pidgeotto you probably don want to spend candy evolving pidgy into more pidgeotto you want to save them until you can evolve pidgeotto into pidgeot because it needs more candymaking more midtier pokemon is less useful than getting the rarer evolved form who will often be more useful in battlealso doublecheck the evolution path many pokemon have another evolved form that opens up as the game expands for example with the addition of the sinnoh region new versions became available you need a sinnoh stone to evolve them meaning some pokemon you thought were finished can now do something else so it worth going back to checksometimes you collect a lucky egg this will double your xp earned for minutes don just randomly drop it however try to use it for maximum gain to help level up your trainer that might be when you arrive in a new busy place and you know you going to be catching or hatching pokemon or where there lots of gyms for you to battle and winso save those lucky eggs for those epic town centre pokemon go sessions to get the most xp in returnsure the ar mode is fun because it brings it to real life but it uses battery and it makes the game more difficult it also doesn work on some lowerpower phonesswitch it off and play in the game world and you find it easier to catch pokemon because the environment is always the same it will save you battery life toowhen you visit a poke stop and spin the sign you don have to tap all the things released just hit the x at the bottom to close the stop and you automatically claim your rewardsremember that if you near a pokestop having lunch or coffee you can visit that stop again and again it just takes a few minutes to become available againgyms are where the real glory lies as they are the route to coins gyms are really what pokemon go is about you battle win and take over a gym for your team you want to leave behind a powerful pokemon to defend that gym as the longer they sit in place and defend it the more coins you earn the more coins you earn the more stuff you can buyyou take over gym for your team and other team members can defend that gym with you some pokemon like blissey are hard to knock out if you want to keep it blissey it but remember that in high turnover gyms like in town centres your pokemon will soon be knocked out so there little point in using your most powerfulalso consider that pokemon that sit in gyms but don defend it don earn many coins so that remote gym no one ever challenges isn going to earn as many coins as you might thinkthis might sound like a cowardly approach but there little point in pitching your squirtle against a kyogre if you don have enough powerful pokemon of your own or a team of friends to battle with then you lose and just have to revive your pokemon and treat them with potionsso check the power of the pokemon in the raid battle before you startwhen battling gyms you can wear down your opponents gradually so you can take on opponents that are more powerful you still lose but you might make some progresssome pokemon don appear very often because you won see these very often making them your buddy means you can earn those types of candies gradually as you walk with time you find you have enough to evolve that pokemonprobably best not to do that with magikarp because you need candies to evolve it and you get bored before anything happens it worth noting however that different pokemon will need you to walk different distancesthe golden razz berry and silver pinap berry are basically the ultimate berry they really good for helping catch important pokemon that just don want to be caught if you been after something for ages and nothing is working the golden razz berry will probably make it happen the silver pinap berry will give you extra candies too when you catch that pokemonhowever you can also feed the golden razz berry to pokemon you have in a gym when your pokemon is feeling miserable and needs some attention basically to keep it in top fighting form then the golden razz berry takes it right back to the top if you want to hang onto that gym this really helpsif you struggling to beat a pokemon and you can figure out why it probably because of type advantage this is basically the underlying principle of the whole pokemon battling world this is replicated in pokemon go with weather factors also boosting some types over others there also the issue of particular fighting moves that your pokemon might havethere are a range of charts available online that you can refer to for the nitty gritty but here are some basic details of which types are strong against which other types in the list below the first named type inflicts increased damage on the secondpokemon go has never been the most stable app all the way from early server problems through to general unresponsiveness you often get a spinning icon in the top left to show that it talking to the server and sometimes it will just get stuck there or commonly you see no poke stops and no nearby pokemonif there nothing happening try tapping the pokeball to open the menu if it not responding stop restart open the app and keep going otherwise you wasting battery and time waiting for it to start working againthis might not be possible for some but going to as many places as possible will help you gather more types of pokemon your home town is likely to be dominated by a certain variety so make sure you go to new places to find morethat might mean getting off the bus early and walking or taking the weekend to head to a different area perhaps visit the family or distant friends then say you want to see all the local sights so you can gather pokemon find gyms to take over and so onspecial events are now fairly frequent and introduce some less common pokemon or previously unseen pokemon including some of the region specific characters you might not have seen make sure you look at the news section of the pokemon go app to see what happeningpokemon go is a battery killer on all phones battery saving mode in pokemon go will let the screen shut off when the phone is upside down meaning you not spending all that battery life on illuminating the screen when you don need to you need a phone with an accelerometer in it to work which may exclude some entrylevel android phonesonce it on you can often put the phone in your pocket upside down the screen will turn off but it will still be live tracking your distance to hatch eggs and vibrating to alert you to pokemonresearch will setting you a range of tasks to complete to give the game more variety it also the route to some of the rarer pokemon often appearing through special events the field research is ongoing letting you complete tasks you get from poke stops like collect pokemon with a weather boost here are some top tipspokemon go can now be synced with the step counter on your phone so that you don need the app open all the time turn on the adventure sync function in the settings menu and that will do the counting when you just walking meaning you can hatch those eggs more easily even if you not playing you get the advantage of all the walking you doingwith more and more regions opening up in pokemon go it can be hard to keep track of those pokemon that can still evolve use the favourite functions to put a star on them so you can see at a glance those pokemon that you still trying to evolve that will make it really easy to select one off the list to make your new buddyraid battles have always put some demands on pokemon go players needing you to be in the right place at the right time thankfully with remote raid passes introduced because of lockdowns you can now see raids and get involved without having to physically be at that location keep and eye on them because it a route to getting some of those rarer pokemon you might reasons why the redmagic is a sublime gaming phone by pocketlint promotion may the original pokemon go game was about discovery and finding pokemon the evolution of battles adds another dimension including a lot of rewards you can battle in tiers earning lots or rewards as you move through

win,pocketlint call of duty mobile brings a heady mix of action both in multiplayer and battle royale gameplaybut if you new to the game there a lot to take in to get you started and get you winning matches and cranking up your xp so let dive into how you can get the most out of call of duty mobile in our extensive tips and tricksprepare device storage you need around of storage to install cod mobile and for game data so you might have to clean something out if you right at the limit your phone won run as well and this is a demanding game codm breaks down the files so you only need to download what you need the entire thing can be up to down background activities and alerts if you have a gaming mode on your device then now is the time to use it to reduce notifications you don want and to kill other processes that might be lowering the performance of your phone to get the best from codm you need your phone running as best it canuse facebook or call of duty account login sadly there no usernamepassword login you have to use facebook your call of duty activision account or play as a guest if you use facebook login you will then be able to move your profile to a different device if you get a new phone or want to play on a tablet for example as you will with an activision accountpro tip occasionally there are incentives for using a different type of login perhaps you can get a different character for connecting to your call of duty account which is worth looking out forconnect your headphones the soundtrack to call of duty mobile is excellent and it also helps you get more aware of what happening around you you be able to pinpoint footsteps listen for the cough of a silenced sniper rifle and much more if you can hear them clearly playing with headphones is a pro move or turn the speakers up loud if you have stereo speakersyou need an internet connection yes as this is live multiplayer there no offline mode you need to be connected to play watch your data allowance or stick to wifi although the game doesn actually use a lot of datahelp my gameplay is laggy if you appear to be freezing or repeatedly moving over the same area it probably because your connection is dropping out try turning wifi on or off or restarting your router or phone to solve the problem sometimes we switch to mobile data when wifi is playing upturn the brightness up what you see is what you shoot the brighter the better so turn off autobrightness turn up the levels and make sure night mode or the blue light filter isn on as it will skew the visuals if you have a game mode on your phone get it to disengage autobrightnessconnect your xbox or ps controller controller you can connect a console controller to play on your mobile you be paired with other people using controllers when you play so you don get an unfair advantage first connect the controller to your device via bluetooth then head into settings controller and you can see when the controller is connected and customise thingsthere a wealth of settings and options for call of duty mobile and the best depends very much on how you like to play and what phone or tablet you playing on it worth taking the time to test all the optionschoose advanced mode there are two methods of control simple or advanced that you be presented at the start of the game simple is autofire when you pointing at someone but advanced gives you full control and it the latter you should choose even if it means getting a little more practise you never get anywhere on simple controlscustomise your controls from the lobby tap the settings cog and you open up all the settings for the game in controls you have the option for simple and advanced as above but in advanced you have the customise button tap this and you can drag control elements to new locations be aware that multiplayer and battle royale have slightly different docks so customise bothturn on prone button to enable dropshotting a recent change as been the addition of the option to go direct to prone lying down rather than having to long press on the crouch button the prone button is off by default but if you turn it on you be able to drop to the ground and keep fighting a move called dropshotting it popular in pubg and it getting very common in codm since that addition of the new control option the options are in settings basic controls hide prone buttonchange the shooting mode in the same area as above in advanced you can change how different weapon types shoot you can fire from the hip aim down sights ads or select custom this will let you change the behaviour of weapon groups so you can fire shotguns from the hip for example which is worth doingchange the graphics quality your device will automatically detect the settings for your phone on first start but if you want to change them in the settings tap audio and graphics here you can select the quality and frame rate as well as other options play around to get the smoothest gameplay you can because setting it too high will cause you problems if it gets jerky this is where you find ultra mode but be aware that it might drop the graphic quality to play at the fastest frame rateadjust the sensitivity different devices respond slightly differently and in sensitivity you can change the settings for how you move as well as how sensitive movements are through scopes using the phone gyroscope these can also be changed for multiplayer and battle royale separately as well as changed for individual scope magnifcations as you might want more sensitivity on lower zoom and lower sensitivity on higher zoom to keep it steadytest your settings with practice vs ai head into multiplayer and tap the selection button just above start to choose the game type here you see practice and practice vs ai this is a great way to test weapons settings and controls to see how they feel and if it going to work for you you can change settings on the fly and this is the place to do itwatch your friends playing you can watch what your friends are doing by heading into your friends list and tapping the eye button you can watch them play in real timecall of duty mobile is divided into two major sections those are multiplayer and battle royale although the controls are broadly similar and the visuals are mostly the same these are fundamentally different modes of play zombie mode has been and gone and come back again for a limited timethere are a number of different multiplayer maps and modes to play the core modes are frontline team deathmatch domination search destroy gunfight kill confirmed hardpoint free for allthen there are features special modes for example standoff halloween sniper only gun game prop hunt there are incentives for playing all types so keep your eyes on the battle pass to see where you can gain rewards the featured modes come and go and sometimes debut with a new map to play on our favourite is vs when it available as it nonstop carnagethe maps vary by the game type changing to suit the type of game you going to play killhouse nuketown russia and temple hijacked cage rust gulag shipment reclaim dome scrapyard oasis highrise crash summit crossfire standoff terminal firing range hackney yard takeoff raid meltdown icebreaker slums suldal harbor shoot house miami strike icebreaker hardhat hacienda hovec sawmill vacant monastery the first are pretty small the second lot are larger changing the style of playsome maps come and go some are assigned to particular game modes so you won always have access to all the mapsthere are also ranked multiplayer matches and these will circulate between game modes and mapsin battle royale there are two maps isolated and blackout and you can play in first or third person perspective you can play solo duo or team there has also been an alcatraz map which is smaller but comes and goes from the game blackout contains locations including many multiplayer map sitesin battle royale you basically parachute in with nothing gather weapons with the aim of being the last player or team surviving the play area gradually decreases pushing surviving players into a tighter area it classic battle royalethe game sometimes has additional modes sniper challenge where it only sniper weapons and warfare which has teams of on opposing sides for a variation on br gameplay but these come and gowhile it just fine to play the game and have fun there a huge rewards system in call of duty mobile this comes in the form of events and the battle pass there a paid and a free path through this both following the same timeline those who pay get access to more characters skins cp ingame currency but those on the free path still get quite a lot of stuffspeed up you battle pass progress you essentially move forward on the battle pass by playing the game and gaining battle pass xp however taking part in the events will speed you along you way and help you get to the higher tiers faster unlocking more and better rewards as you do sowatch the events the events system adds some variety to the game while you can just play tdm all the time if that what you want the events add variety and through a series of tasks increase your rewards and battle pass progress this will include credits weapon xp battle pass xp crates and sometimes new weapons characters and skins see what listed in the seasonal or featured events and you find things like kill enemies with agr equipped with any attachments this basically steps you through the process earns the rewards and adds the chance to play all the new features of the gamegunsmith allows you to customise your weapons with loads of attachments and skins you have to unlock a lot of the options and that done by playing with those weapons or using weapon xp cards to levelup that weapongunsmith can be found in the loadout section and to complete some events you need top use gunsmith to ensure you have the right number of attachments on the right weapon to progress just tap on the gunsmith button and you enter the area we written a comprehensive guide to gunsmith right here if you want more detailsend xp to friends friends have a number of uses in codm and one is as a method of getting more weapon xp cards you can send xp to your ingame friends and you recieve weapon xp back it a simple daily task that gives you more cards so you can do more in gunsmithwatch the weapon stats the changes you make aren just for fun they change the characteristics of the weapon that might be the accuracy the damage or the mobility the values will go up green or down red to show you what changes you make to that weapon this lets you change weapons to suit your style of play for example boosting mobility if you like to play fast and close or increasing damage and range if you a long range fighterpay attention to perks it easy to ignore perks because they don all have an immediate impact on weapon characteristics but they can do things like speed up your magazine change or increase the damage of a weapon one of the most powerful perks is akimbo which lets you carry twin fennec smgs but that has to be earnt and unlockedthere is a wealth of weaponry in call of duty mobile and you can collect and upgrade these weapons apply skins and choose your loadouts for playing multiplayer gamesincrease your xp to unlock more loadouts as you play you earn xp to rank up and unlock extra loadout slots you can have different loadouts each with primary and secondary weapons grenades an operator skill and three perks meaning you can choose a different loadout for different mapschoose your weapons wisely the loadout you carry determines what you enter the game with and this will change based on the map and game type you playing maps like killhouse hijacked and nuketown are great for smgs because it close quarters combat a map like crossfire is great for longer range weapons having loadouts means you can change during a match to suit the situationupgrade your weapons rewards can get you weapons cards for upgrades and this can be anything from adding a scope to extending the barrel the weapon characteristics chart will show the impact of those changes you make and this can make a big difference to how that weapon performs in the game this is what gunsmith is all aboutyou can really hide in multiplayer while you can stay out of sight or find a corner or building to lurk in when playing multiplayer the two sides are separated by the enemy wearing red flashes on their uniform camouflage doesn really matter in that sense as you can spot the red marks even when hiding you can be spotted by a uav and placed on the map so remember you not invisibledon wear red there are a number of red skinsoutfits and this can confuse your team if someone sees a flash of red it easy to think it an enemy avoiding those red colours might help your team focus on who they are fighting particularly important in hardcore modetop nintendo switch games best switch titles every gamer must own by max freemanmills may on moving because you can hide staying still is your enemy keep moving so the enemy can target you a skill to master is strafing sideways while keeping the enemy in your sights duck into cover when you run out of ammo pop out again to engage it simple use of cover but it works really welluse the slide you can tap the down button when running to slide this is unpredictable and gives you a much better chance of making it to cover and avoiding getting shotget familiar with crouch crouch is really useful decreasing your visible area while still letting you move around there even a perk for this skulker which makes you faster when moving croucheduse sprint sprinting means you can move faster you can slide up the forward controller or tap the sprint button to do this there a menu option for always sprint too but use this with caution it sometimes means you can stop as accurately as you want and you might end up running into your enemy by mistake but that a great option when using a shotgun as you can sprint and spray there also a perk to make you faster use itgo to your pistol the renetti is a great sidearm and it will take people down just as readily as a rifle when you up close often it faster to switch to the pistol than it is to reload your primary weapon it great for maps like nuketown when things get crazy in the middle avoid the silencer though it lowers the range but through gunsmith you can increase the capacity to make it more effectiveuse your grenades when the fighting gets tough often there isn time to grab a grenade but it a great opening move on maps like killhouse and nuketown lobbing the grenade from one end to the other is fairly easy and can quickly wake up your enemy just make sure you don run into your own grenade and make sure the opening immunity has expiredwatch out for martyrdom perk this drops a grenade when a player dies something to watch out for if you are too close to the player you just killed their grenade might take you outmaster the sticky grenade the sticky grenade is great because it doesn bounce or roll throw it through a window throw it against a wall and it stays there it great for clearing snipers out of rooms or clearing out people hiding behind cratesmaster the scorestreaks the scorestreaks are really powerful you have three slots to fill and these can be anything from a hunter killer drone to a vtol gunship which is basically a game finisher some are ai guided others offer manual control the predator missile for example needs to be guided to where you want it to hit the sentry gun can be placed and left cutting down the enemy when they come around a corner but can also be damaged by enemy fire to activate scorestreaks you need to get mixed in with the enemy and take some scalpstake out enemy aircraft scorestreaks the stealth chopper and vtol can really damage your team but you can shoot them down choose an lmg and unload into it and you shoot it down alternative if you have the sparrow skill with explosive arrows a couple of hits from these will bring down aircraft of course there the which will lock on and end that scorestreak pretty rapidlytake the fight to the enemy in games like frontline and team deathmatch take the fight to the enemy hanging back might mean you out of the game not doing anything while your teammates are locked in fighting find those strategic points on the maps and dominate them pinning your enemy inget fancy with smoke smoke grenades are actually very useful if the enemy has you pinned down obviously but if there sniper in a building you can get past smoke out the room by lobbing that grenade through the window or drop smoke to give you cover while you retreat from invincible respawned enemy it also really useful in domination when you capturing a location so the enemy can see youpick the loadout for the map and the team the multiplayer maps encourage a range of different gameplay styles crossfire for example has a lot of places for snipers whereas nuketown does not vary your loadout to suit the map and the team if you have five players with sniper rifles on nuketown you might struggle or just get bored be prepared to switch to maximise team performancetop tip for hijacked if you playing on the hijacked map the boat there a secret passage through the boat that will take you from one end to the other this can bring you up behind the enemy so you can even up the score just head into the cabin and look for the hole in the floorbattle royale feels like a totally different game in call of duty mobile you don get to start with your preferred loadout you can just respawn at will and you have a much larger play area and it a much more tactical game than the combat of multiplayer even the user interface is slightly different although alcatraz brings a smaller play area that more like multiplayerswitch to fpv if you play a lot of multiplayer and are used to the firstperson view you can switch to that view with a tap rather than the thirdperson viewchoose where you drop carefully the maps are fairly well loaded with both vehicles and weapons but if you drop into a builtup area you more likely to run straight into contact where the first person to get a weapon will hunt you all down go a little more remote and you more likely to survive through the first minutes alcatraz has numerous high points and often there are sniper rifles there so you can easily dominatework as a team or not team work makes the dream work drop with your team move with your team fight with your team and you easily win but if your teammates are determined to drop into contact and die straight away you might want to go solo to survivebattle royale is about survival if you just want to kill play multiplayer insteadrevive your teammates there are revival flights that will drop you back into the game but it better if you can get revived by a teammate remember that if a teammate is in contact with the enemy they ignore you until it clear so don just crawl straight over to them get close but be prepared to wait to be revived if you can dropping smoke can give you cover while you revive someonedon worry you got a wingsuit as you wearing a wingsuit it doesn matter if you jump out of a helicopter or off the top of a tower as you survive use that to your benefit you can wingsuit right on top of someone and pop with your shotgun if you don have the range to engage from the top of a mountain it great funkeep your eye on the map and look for footprints knowing where the enemy is is half the fight in battle royale watch the map for footprints if you a scout keep your ears open and you know where they are before they know you there it the route to victoryhit the deck unlike multiplayer where hitting the deck means dying in the dirt in battle royale you can hide and wait until your enemy is in range before engaging them it really workswatch your ammo there are loads of different weapons but you can rinse through your ammo really quickly keep an eye on how much you have make sure you not picking up stuff you don need and make sure your second weapon is useful,en,654.0,Positive

late april was followed up by an absolutely tiny teaser trailer that really doesn give much away but again underlines the title and logothe new era of call of duty is coming all nice and exciting and we can wait to see what infinity ward has up its sleeve it been talking quite a big game about how revolutionary the title will be after alllooking further forward we even seen indications that the game after this one will be a return to the black ops series suggesting a familiar rotation of titles is spinning up however a bombshell report from bloomberg had indicated that it will not release in leaving modern warfare with a full twoyear cycle of support to enjoythat big news for both the franchise and the game since no title has got a full two years without a new competitor in over a decade it be interesting to see what plans infinity ward can cook up to keep it fresh for that longcall of duty normally comes out on every single platform that can run it to maximise sales but everything changed in january when xbox announced that it was buying activision the series publisherthe news sent shockwaves through the community since it threatened the possibility that call of duty might become an exclusive series to xbox hardware on console somewhere down the line while that possible eventually it won affect modern warfare game will release before the deal is completed and existing contracts with playstation means that at least the next main cod to come out in should also appear on and microsoft has also stated that it intends to keep the franchise on playstation once those deals run outthus you can be confident that modern warfare at least will appear on xbox playstation and pc when it releases including for older consolesallegedly codenamed internally as project cortez the game will feature a singleplayer campaign that rumoured to take place during the americanled war on drugs in south americaaccording to further reporting by tom henderson the game will be even grittier than modern warfare which already leant further into realism than call of duty has for a while with missions like clean house featuring realistic room clearances and night visioninfinity ward has been working on the game since it released modern warfare giving it a healthy threeyear cycle during which to innovate and the campaign will accordingly see some nice additions like real narrative choices and guns that might sometimes jam to really put you up the creek without a paddlethe story should see captain price task force taking the fight to colombia cartels in undercover missions that won be as militarised instead focussing on stealth and incisivenessthere will obviously be a significant amount of continuity from the last modern warfare when it comes to gameplay for the next game from infinity ward but that still leaves room for some improvements and additionstop nintendo switch games best switch titles every gamer must own by max freemanmills may still expect it to feature a low timetokill making it fairly hardcore as shooters go but will be interested to see if it embraces some of the technical advances made by vanguard in the meantimefor example the shooter features much more destructibility in maps and environments as well as an expanded weapon mounting system that lets you move around more while still getting weapon control bonuseswe think the latter will probably stay but we not sure about the environmental design given how much cleaner and less cluttered many of modern warfare maps are compared to other call of duty titleselsewhere tom henderson extensive report says that the campaign will feature more advanced enemy ai that react more to your shots and clutch wounds you inflict as they duck for cover that sounds a little grim written down but in motion will probably just make for a more immersive feel as you fighthe has also said that the game will feature multiple remastered maps from the original modern warfare multiplayer component which means we could be going back to legendary locations like dust and terminalafter the messy integration of black ops cold war into warzone with a recycled map and unbalanced weapons activision seems to be aware that it has to stick the landing better when it comes to new cod titles getting mixed into its freetoplay sensationvanguard brought an allnew map with it caldera taking the fight into the pacific arena and finally bringing a new location to the table and from the sounds of it modern warfare will seek to make that an annual changeaccording to its community briefing infinity ward is building a new warzone experience from the ground up with modern warfare on a new engine that all cod games will share moving forward to avoid similar teething problems between their ecosystemsthe game will have a new map alongside a new sandbox mode that we haven heard much more about and infinity ward sounds confident that it going to shake up the battle royale genre again with this new reimagining of warzoneactivision has said in recent job adverts that it sees the next step for the cod franchise as transitioning it into its state and that means more connectivity between

duty warzone has well and truly settled into caldera now after it waved goodbye to the original map verdansk upon the launch of mainline game cod vanguardthings are getting pretty wild in the latest season too with the arrival of towering behemoths godzilla and king kong on the island find out all the details belowseason of warzone subtitled classified arms launched on april so you can tuck into it ingame nowthis monstersized season is now declassified here everything coming to season three of and a bunch of detail in the above image about what arrived in the season but we broken it down belowthere are a host of changes as part of the season so we separated them out into sections for you you can check out the update full patch notes to get all the granular detailthe longawaited and muchrumoured arrival of godzilla and king kong on the island will be part of a limitedtime event called operation monarch we know that the two monsters will actually be there on the island thanks to glimpses in trailers like the one belowbe a force against the force of nature gear up with the season three arms battle pass on april in and pictwittercomyrhaltyqzyyou can see them moving around and launching huge attacksthe important thing to note is that this event isn immediate it slated to happen on may we hoping it last at least a few days so that you have some wiggle room to organise a sessionthere are four new weapons for warzone and vanguard a new marksman rifle the is joined by the nikita avt assault rifle and you can get both for free by levelling up your battle passlater in the season a new melee option will appear in the form of a hammer called the junkyard jet likely inspired by king kong brute strength finally an smg called the blixen will also appear at a certain pointsome changes have come to peak the top of caldera central volcano finishing off the inprogress building work and turning it into a more complete fortress this should make it even more of a hot dropspot than it already wasalso new is a point of interest called dig site where huge skeletons hint at a crazy past for caldera while the runway and lagoon areas are getting more points of cover added to them to make them a little less open and vulnerablethe gulag warzone lastchance saloon has received a new map seemingly set in the hold of a cargo ship it been a while since the gulag got a new rotation so this could be welcome for those who tend to die a lot as they playthe previous update for warzone came out on march after a few days of teasers from raven software about what it would entail season two reloaded launches at pst a new lte rebirth reinforced weapon trade stations deployable buy stations new modes a new weapon new operators new gameplay and morethe patch notes are available at means if you haven played since before the update you want to ensure you get the patch downloaded regardless of what platform you onthis update for warzone was mainly focussed on rebirth island the smaller map that plays host to some of the game less timeconsuming and more casual playlists but there were a fair few telling changes that apply to caldera as wellarms race rebirth reinforced and the codfather check out everything coming to and in season two reloaded alcatrazflavoured island has been a mainstay since it launched alongside verdansk a couple of years back and this is the biggest set of changes that have hit it since then there are a fair few new points of interest to help add cover to spots like the prison courtyard that were previously very openthe map lighting has also changed substantially while the decor all over the island has been updated to reflect the supremacy of stitch nova gas manufacturing bad guys in the slightly complicated canon of the call of duty worldthese new keyboards by logitech have our favourite emojis built in and we love them by pocketlint promotion may a new smg to try out the armaguerra which hits nice and hard at close range but also seems to have manageable enough recoil to work at slightly farther out distances too it also in the ground loot rotation for both rebirth and caldera so you can try it out thereyou can now find very rare drops that let you spawn in an airdropped buy station that sticks around for a few minutes a hugely useful option if you need to buy someone back into the match or get your loadout but you don have a buy station within rangearmour satchel and gas mask changessmall tweaks to gas masks mean you can now drop a mask for a teammate while armour satchels now display the number of plates they contain making it easier to manage your armour once you already have a satchelthere are a few balance tweaks to weapons and their attachments although these are granular enough that they not causing a dramatic shift in the meta at this point you can find out more detail in the full patch notes herethe last season of warzone got extended by a few weeks to give raven and the other development teams more time to get the next one ready but season debuted on februarythe best defense is a heavilyarmored offense see whats rolling into and in season twocoming february more means you can dive into caldera right now and check out all the new content and adjustmentsthis is a seriously big set of changes for warzone even by the standards of a new season you can find all the detail on the call of duty blog here but we pulled out the highlights belowthere are four new weapons to unlock and use during the course of the season including the kg assault rifle and whitley lmg on day one both of which apparently pack high damage outputs and manageable recoilthe ice axe will debut in a bundle midseason while the armaguerra smg will also come out as part of the midseason updatepart of the ongoing story of warzone involves the discovery of nebula v gas on caldera and it going to play a big gameplay role new field upgrades around the gas are herefirstly nebula v ammo adds a clip of toxic ammo to your gun dealing no extra damage to players but adding an effect if you down them they be surrounded by a gas cloud to hinder those trying to revive them like the circle gas doeseven more potent are nebula v bombs superrare items that let you set off a timed explosive to set a spreading twominute minicircle of the gas on an area blocking off flankers or trapping people in a buildingfinally the addition of portable decontamination stations counters this a little they let you create a safe haven in either nebula v or circle gas giving you critical time to heal up and replate your armour before moving onnew vehicles have arrived in vanguard royale modes although you can only drive one the new bomberthis fourman plane can drop payloads that destroy loadout boxes and inflict massive damage on players and vehicles so teams may look to focus on bringing them down from aa guns and trucks the standard planes can do significant damage to bombers too although they getting their health pool thankfully reducedalso new are armoured transport trucks which drive along set routes and defend themselves with machine guns they tough to take down but will drop toptier loot including the chance for a nebula v bombfor the first time outside of limitedtime modes warzone has got pve scenarios or more accurately pvpve two new location types are guarded by enemy ai for players to clear out in fights that could alert other teams to their whereaboutsthe first is a chemical factory near mines and docks expanding on a refinery that was already there it has patrolling guards and highvalue loot along with some sort of trap that players can deploy additionally seven new underground labs have opened up we seen various hatches and bunker doors around caldera so you might already know where they are although circles on your map will make things more obviousthey too are guarded by squads of ai soldiers but hold loot including durable gas masks and potential nebula v ammotaking a note from the books written by apex legends and pubg these new balloons dotted around the map let you zipline up to a height and then jump off for a parachute glide to a new locations hundreds of metres away giving you a way to quickly outrun the gas or get out of an engagementafter a huge amount of consternation raven recently announced that it was making a major change to balance in warzone effective immediately whereas when pacific launched the schedule for buying a loadout changed to make players wait longer before they were available that being revokeda update has gone live loadout drops are now available for purchase via buy stations from the getgo in battle royale no more waitingthe season one patch notes have been amended see feb pictwittercomozuuborvkwthis means that from now on the second you have collected you can buy a loadout drop regardless of when in the match that might be the community has rejoiced after demanding the change for weeks although we a little worried it just mean the best teams in each lobby will get their best guns even more quicklyraven recently released a midseason update for caldera adjusting a load of weapons and fixing a range of bugs although the game still has plenty of issues including a really frequent freeze when you open a buy stationit a pretty lowkey update compared to midseason launches from the months gone by without a major theme or new map events but if the developers are focussing their energy on fixing bugs and exploits we not complainingthe one major addition in this update is a new smg the welrod gun which raven says is a shorttomidrange option like most smgs you can unlock it by getting kills while aiming down sights on smgs and it shouldn be too onerous to get hold ofalso included in the new update are a host of adjustments to weapons and their attachments focussing in particular on the bren and all of which have been perhaps a little too easy to use since pacific launchedthey a bit too detailed to go into fully but in general more recoil should be present when using meta attachments like the carver foregrip on these weapons making them at least a little more challenging in some engagementsyou can find full details of all the changes right down to the percentage in the patch notes that raven has posted right herewarzone pacific as it is now called is live right now after launching for everyone on december means you free to explore the new map calderamarks your dropwhere will you be dropping can get a sense for the new map thanks to the tweet above from call of duty which reveals its main regions and areas which you can also check out in motion thanks to the trailer below now that the game is fully out in the wild though you be able to see loads more gameplay footage on youtube too or jump in yourselfwe got plenty of key details on how warzone pacific works compared to the old version in particular how weaponry functions with three games worth of guns to balance it a little complicateda new mode called vanguard royale is limited to vanguard weaponry only for a periodappropriate battleground there is also still a core battle royale mode where you can mix and match all the weapons you have unlocked toovanguard plunder returns the cashgathering mode to the roster too for a more relaxing way to level up weaponsthere are new vehicles including planes for the first time ever and antiaircraft trucks to help counter the threat that they pose the planes are fairly simple to control and really lethal but the good news is that those antiair trucks and emplacements destroy them very quicklya blog post when caldera launched had absolutely loads of detail about the map change but perhaps equally exciting as the new location are some of the many balance changes that it detailed for the game itselffor one each match pacing received a huge change you could now only buy a loadout drop once the free boxes airdrop in after a few minutes into each match having featured in the verdansk flashback game mode this was a thenwelcome feature that made earlygame fights a little more evenfooted in our opinionthe gulag experience returned this time hosted in a mine shaft but now you drop back into the main map after winning holding whatever gun and equipment you had at the end of the fight so conserving ammo and tacticals could give you an advantage once you landstopping power was removed from the game entirely and dead silence got nerfed to become rarer and to only refresh after one kill rather than infinitely the muchfeared kali sticks melee also got hit by a nerf while stun grenades and heartbeat sensors both get their utility curtailed a bit as wellmost lethals deal more damage now with the stim and snapshot grenade getting buffs to their usefulness the former gives you a speed boost while the latter has a much wider radius even the lowly decoy grenade got a buff to pack in rubber pellets that deal light damage to nearby enemiesgas masks don interrupt animations as often as they used to praise be while new gas canisters can be hauled around with both hands and be detonated to damage your foes making them perfect for traps you can even attach them to ziplines to give parties at the top of buildings a nasty surprisefinally the addition of areas of shallow water that you can wade in lets players dull the effects of tracker to hide more efficiently or crouchwalk to get the benefits of coldblooded chucking a molotov at the water meanwhile causes a smoke effect that could offer useful coverto get a full sense of all the balance changes check out the patch notes for the update right here be warned they extensivealso receiving some tweaks are contracts with new contract types entering the fray supply drop contracts airdrop a supply crate full of cash and goodies onto the map for anyone to collect but give your team and your team alone the exact location it going to dropbig game bounty which someone will only be able to pick up once per match will mark the game kill leader for you to hunt down giving you a real challenge and offering bigger rewards as a resultfinally a mysterious top secret contract doesn appear on the minimap and will bring extra juicy rewards but will assign you a random contract type without you having any say in the matteron top of all these gameplay changes of course is the arrival of call of duty new ricochet anticheat on pc which will be a big boost to players on all platforms thanks to crossplaya kernellevel anticheat it monitor for suspect play and external programmes influencing the game and should hopefully make a big difference to the amount of cheating that goes on in public warzone lobbiesyou can read more about it here on the call of duty websitebefore we left verdansk for the last time at the start of december there was a flurry of live events to enjoy on the old map bidding farewell to this familiar playgroundwe enjoyed operation verdansk flashback which was designed to give players reminders of all the times they had in verdansk it was absolute carnage with constant ingame eventsthere was also an ongoing live event called secrets of the pacific which tasked players with gathering intel files on the new map caldera to find out more about it before the migration happensfinally there was a limitedtime oneday mode called the last hours of verdansk a full live event that bid goodbye to the fabled map heralding the start of warzone pacific it tasked players with controlling a bunker at the end of a game and was frantic

Season 3 of the COD battle royale,pocketlint call of duty warzone doesn show any signs of slowing down with more than million players around the world having dropped into the game to duke it out codstyle and what better way to while away the days than with a freetoplay battle royale game tied to an already dominant franchisewe dropped more times than we can count into the zone practising and squadding up to figure out some useful strategies and tips that you can take into your own sessions say it quietly we even winning a few games so here are our top tips to become a better cod warzone choice of landing zone is a key variable at the start of a match the second you see that cutscene of the plane starting up you can bring up the map screen for your match and see where the shrinking gas circle will start that can help you to gain a sense of where people are more likely to land and for where you have to aim for as it approachesit important that as your confidence grows you can tailor your tactics on this front if you don fancy yourself in chaotic gunfights maybe go more remote in order to get some solid equipment alternatively go for the trial by fire approach and train yourself in fighting by seeking out crowded areas like the everpopular capital it up to you but make sure you do pick a spot as a squadpretty much the minute warzone went live players figured out a cheeky way to get a bit of a headstart in a match as you drop from the plane over the map you can pop your parachute whenever you like to glide down more slowly what people realised though is that you can actually cut your cord to dive again and repop your parachute as many times you like now most players use that to their advantagefirstly as you fall popping your chute then cutting the cords gives you a short speed boost and throws you forward more aggressively letting you cover ground more quickly to get to your chosen landing zonesecondly after you cut your parachute away you get a few seconds where your starting pistol is drawn potentially letting you get some shots away at other people falling to get that first little advantage if you okay being a bit toxicwarzone has a cash economy at its heart you collect money as you run around and earn more for completing contracts more on those later some matches you hardly find any while in others you be swimming in the stuff soon enough either way be sure not to sit on your cash too longin the battle royale modes there are no bonuses for keeping hold of cash so it really only there for you to use at the buy stations marked on your map these let you buy a selection of killstreaks like precision airtsrikes and cluster strikes as well as more armour plating and loadout drops our advice would be to be proactive on buying these rewards you can take the money with you after all and a welltimed uav could win you a gunfight really easilythat said if your teammates are dying a lot you might want to keep hold of to buy them back in should they fail to win their redemptive gulag fightcash is important then but when you hit up a buy station it might be worth knowing what your priority should be as we said killstreaks can be a huge help but the absolute top priority in your squad should be for someone to buy a loadout drop as soon as possible during each match these airdrops let your whole squad pick one of their personal loadouts to swap into getting their customised guns and equipmentthat like slipping on a glove in this context letting you get in the groove with a loadout you comfortable with and all of the best players use it to dominate follow suit if you canwhen pacific launched you could only buy a loadout of your own once the free ones drop in a few minutes into each game that been revoked now and you can buy a loadout any time you have enough cash so it back to an early game cashrace at presentin terms of your loadouts themselves while you can obviously feel free to experiment with perks too we highly recommend running with ghost by default which will hide you from uavs and heartbeat monitors it pretty much a mandatory pick unless you want an overkill class to get two of your favourite guns at onceif you daunted by the price tag of a loadout drop though there are some good ways to earn cash and loot while you move around the map contracts these are marked out for you and fall into a number of types bounties and big game bounties scavenger recon most wanted supply drop supply run and top secretbounties mark out one player on the map for you in a radius that gets smaller as you get closer to them giving you a set amount of time to locate and kill him or her and rewarding you if they die usefully if you take out a bounty and someone elsekills that player you still get a smaller reward there no downside to picking one of these up it tell you where a player is and you get xp just for starting it a big game bounty can only be chosen once per game and targets whoever in the lobby has the most kills for bigger rewardsscavenger contracts mark out a succession of three loot boxes for you to find and open with solid loot in them and a cash reward when you finish the set you also get a guaranteed drop of an armour satchel when you finish it too letting one player hold up to plates again these are no brainers although they very popular targets at the start of matchesrecons meanwhile point you towards a capture point for you to lock down and can feel a bit riskier they require you to stay still for a little while sometimes out in the open they tell you where the circle will next close though as a huge tactical benefit and are favourites for experienced players and you can stack that information up if you move quicklymost wanted is a doubleedged sword you marked as a target for everyone on the map for three minutes but if you survive that time limit not only do you get a cash reward any dead teammates instantly drop back into the game whether they in the gulag or spectatingsupply drop airdrops in a valuable crate of supplies and tells your team exactly where it will land while anyone else in the lobby can see it come in and try to intercept without that guidancesupply run gives you limited time to make it to a specifically marked buy station get there in time and you enjoy personal discounts on your next purchase including a free selfrevive kit or buyback to give you an advantage moving forwardfinally top secret gives you a random contract with an enhanced reward to make up for the lottery you enteringthe final word though is that these contracts aren just good for loot and money they also give you a shortterm objective to aim for and are a great way of making a match feel more structured and less like guesswork frankly blazing out in a game where you ticked off a couple of contracts is more fun than hiding in one place for minutes and then dyingwe keep mentioning squads and while you can play warzone in solos mode the aim is clearly still for most players to join a squad in the main battle royale mode we encourage you to think tactically as a squad therefore if you sat with full armour and five spare plates while your squadmates are down to nothing drop some plates for them to pick upthe same goes for cash and ammo it often the case that only by pooling your cash can a loadout marker be bought for example this will encourage more selfless play in the long runjust like every other battle royale game since apex legends came out warzone has a ping system to let you communicate with your squaddies it lets you show them what you looking at or where you aiming for this is an easy tip but use it all the time whenever you can and map it to a button you comfortable with to make that easier the more information you share the further your squad will gothere also a range of field equipment that you can find around the map as you go which can help you out in a pinch whether it a deployable bit of cover to block an enemy sightline the dead silence field upgrade to make you quiet for a spell or more there are a lot of ways these can helpone fun tactic that was quickly discovered involves the field drone you can find if you use the drone and a teammate has equipped they can actually drop the on the drone to turn it into a miniaturised mobile bomb although this will not work in vanguard royale where the equipment isn availableone of the most refreshing parts of warzone is that death doesn have to be the end at all firstly unless you die right near the end of the game after your first death you be sent to the gulag a mine shaft of a jail where you await a oneonone gunfight to earn reentry to the battlefield even if you lose your squad can still buy you back if they have the moneyif two of you go to the gulag at once though you could be able to help each other out often our teammate has been able to give us callouts while they watched our gunfight helping us to win then getting back into the game take every advantage you can getof course warzone isn just pure battle royale there also plunder a mode that sees you buzzing around the map looking for cash and cash alone before sending it away at designated points it much more chaotic and frenetic than battle royale especially because respawns are enabled and there no gas circle to worry aboutif you want a change from the nailbiting tension of battle royale rounds it a great option to switch it up with and you might even find that you prefer it it particularly great for levelling up your guns drop into plunder with a double weapon xp token live and concentrate on supply runs with vehicles and you zip through the rankingsalternatively season saw the addition of a second smaller map rebirth island modelled on alcatraz it a frantic game map that packs the action into a far less expansive space and is another great option if you want to swap your pacing up it be returning to warzone pacific soonsince launch there have been plenty of changes to playlists in warzone already we got a solos mode if you fancy taking on the map on your lonesome and the launch of the original season saw the addition of quads raising your squad size to four that perfect if you were always excluding a mate to get down to a threeman squadstill though if you don have four people and don want a random in your team you could always change your squad fill settings to make sure that it just your friends and take your chances with a smaller squad it a disadvantage for sure but it can be fun to see how your tactics have to change under duressyou might not have realised it but there are two situations in warzone that send up a signal flare into the sky for nearby players to see one is starting to capture a recon contract point which sends up a white flare while the other is buying back a squadmate which sends up a red flarekeep an eye out for these signals as you move around the map and you could get the drop on a team camping at a capture point or waiting for an unlooted squadmate to return to the frayit tempting and easy to find a couple of spots on the map where you love to drop whether because they generally isolated or lootladen but fight the urge to return to them too often you improve more quickly and learn the map much faster if you switch up your drop points and occasionally go for locations you know will be busier it also change the rhythm of your play session which we think is a good thingas you enter the endgame of a match a popular and powerful tactic is to hug the gas ring outer edge as it closes picking off fleeing targets and staying just ahead of it yourself this basically requires you to have a gas mask so that you less at risk yourself but be aware that the mask onoff animations can be disruptive although they being slowly fixed bit by bitthe first time it happens to you it ruin your day but your character pulling the mask on and off can interrupt you firing and reduce you to useless hip fire for a couple of seconds at key moments so be sure to plan for it it not necessarily something you ever be able to reliably control but if you learn to expect the disruption you at least stop being quite so annoyed by itseason meaning the first season not cold war equivalent launched back in the day to groans about file sizes worldwide and its major initial addition comes in the form of inmatch events these are now more commond than ever and can happen randomly during any match there are multiple typesthese events can be gamechanging so if they occur in a match be sure to adjust your tactics accordingly and watch the skies however not all of them occur in all modes with vanguard royale seeing more frequent events from a limited pool of optionsbest games amazing playstation titles to pick up by max freemanmills may might sound a bit trite but we really mean it whether you never won a game or haven for weeks keep playing sensibly and making tactical decisions and the wins will come at some point they won always happen how you think either we always remember one game back in verdansk coming off a hot streak of losses we died early got through the gulag without any opponent after an anxious twominute wait dropped near the final circle with no gun and hid for five minutes before sneaking in picking up a single smg and firing three shots to finish off the last player standing who never even saw usone kill a lot of tension and a huge slice of fortune and we back in wintown warzone is a game of skill laced with a lot of luck and situational awareness so don be disheartened if you on a bad run basically,en,553.0,Positive

storage,pocketlint the playstation has been out for a while now and it finally got a feature that was revealed before it came out the ability to take on an additional internal ssd for more quick storagewith about of ssd space out of the box and only around of that actually accessible to gamers because of the os taking up room getting more space is something that plenty of people will be really keen on it not the simplest process but we here to walk you through how to get it donefirst up you should know that only a select few ssds are actually going to work with the internally they need to be an drive and even more crucially they need to fit into the slot they allocated to with a heatsink attachedfor now there are two top recommendations to go with first there the seagate firecuda this is a lightningfast drive that shoots past all of sony requirements on the speed front and happily also has a small enough heatsink that it you could also go with the from wdblack which similarly is more than fast enough to work with sony requirements and also has a diminutive heatsink either is a great choice although sony has clarified that even the fastest drives might not perform exactly like the own standard expansion is available to all users now after having been limited to those enrolled in sony beta testing system so all you have to do is make sure that you on the latest system software possibleyou can tell whether you have a software update waiting for you by visiting this part of the settings menu on your consolenext up you want to fully power down your by holding its power button for three seconds leave it to cool down for a few minutes then unplug it completely this have you ready to install your ssdyou want the laying on a soft surface with the disc drive side facing upward so upsidedown compared to how it normally rests then with a bit of force you can lever the white cover off the by gripping it at the top corner and lifting it up while sliding it toward the baseit a little finicky so don exert too much force if you pull it outward a bit and slide it down toward the base screw hole of the you should be able to click it off this will show you the slot for the ssd although it be covered by a metal plate as you can see belowyou can easily unscrew this cover using a crosshead screwdriver letting you see the slot for the ssdthen it a fairly simple matter of clicking the ssd into place and securing it using the screw and spacer that you find within they at the end of the slot marked with size of your ssd will determine where the screw and spacer secure it and it should be fairly obvious once you click the ssd into its slot you find it easiest if you click it into its housing at the base as in the image above then secure it from the other endyou want the spacer underneath the ssd and the screw to go through the semicircular housing on the ssd end to secure it in placefrom here it about going back in reverse once your ssd is secure you can screw the cover for its slot back into place then you can reattach the white plastic side of the sliding it into place until it clicks solidly then hook it all back up to power by your tvif you done everything right powering on the should send you to a formatting screen to set your drive up once that process is complete in under a minute from our experience you be free to enjoy your expanded storage and forget about the days of deleting games all the timeif any of these steps are unclear meanwhile you can check out sony extremely detailed information page here which also contains really granular breakdowns of exactly what type of ssd you want to buy in case our two recommendations aren to your tastesyou might rightly conclude that the cheapest way to get yourself an ssd for the would be to buy a model without a heatsink then attach a thirdparty heatsink yourself before fitting it using the steps above and you be rightit not as difficult as it sounds either we walk you through it below using xpg gammix blade as an example since it ships with the heatsink not yet attached and more than exceeds sony speed reasons why the redmagic is a sublime gaming phone by pocketlint promotion may most important factor here is size make sure that you get a heatsink and ssd combination that won exceed sony size requirements as laid out in that detailed guide on its websitecheck which side of your ssd you be attaching your heatsink to it the side with the storage on although if your ssd is doublesided you should just go with whichever has more storage areas in the case of the gammix blade a sticker is attached to one side to stop you from accidentally installing the heatsink on there which is handy although it also needs to be peeled off before it goes in your consolepeeling back the sticker on your heatsink will expose the adhesive that will stick the component onto your ssdfrom there it a simple but precise matter of sticking the heatsink down onto the ssd gently but firmly you can line up the notch in one end with the notch in your ssd to ensure that you be able to fix it in place in your when you come to install itmake sure that you align it straight and you be all finished the drive is now ready to be installed in your following the steps we outlined further up so long as your heatsink is sized appropriately to fit into the expansion

game,pocketlint elden ring has now been out for over a month after being greeted on release with the sort of critical acclaim that most developers only dream of millions of players have had the chance to explore its marvellous open worldlike all of fromsoftware other modern releases though elden ring is hard it a game that often doesn tell you things that come to seem entirely integral to the game mechanics later and while it holds your hands more than some in the souls series you still might need some help here then are some quick tips to help you get started with the way that levelling up and experience works in elden ring means that you can build a character to your own specifications over time even if you end up realising that your starting choice set you off on the wrong footthat great to know because it means you don need to spend twenty minutes deliberating over which to pick when the game starts choose one that looks fun and see how you do if you want a meleefocussed build the armoured classes are good options while those with high mind and faith are ideal for magic castingthe one thing to avoid though is the wretch it intended for players who want to have full control over their stats and make toptier builds but if you new to souls games it make the early stages harder so won be for youa big change for souls games one that we thrilled by is the addition of an easy way to change how your character looks once you enter the game it will take a few hours to unlock but once you can access roundtable hold it be open to youjust head into fia room and look for a cloudy mirror standing in front of it will give you the chance to pop in and change things and there no cost or limit on how often you can tweak thingselden ring has a hilarious approach to getting you into its world after a short preamble you wake up in a cave with a ghostly figure sat in a chair moving past him you see a doorway that opens into the full worlddon rush through it though the hole that the seated ghost is next to is the entrance to a tutorial area with combat instructions and some key control scheme pointers it a crucial step for those who are new to souls games but you can easily blitz past it don be afraid to drop into that hole basicallyelden ring opens with a few short areas for you to traverse including the prerequisite boss to instantly kill you after that point you learn the basics of combat against some weak enemies and we recommend taking things slowly hererather than sweeping through with clumsy but quick kills take the time to learn how to block properly and experiment with the timings of those blocks and dodges you thank yourself a short while later when enemies start to punch way way harderonce you hit the overworld of limgrave at the game start you start to run into enemies as you move around and there one right out of the gate patrolling on a huge horse he there almost explicitly to teach you a lesson namely you can take many foes down right now so try skirting aroundit a tactic that will remain useful throughout pretty much the whole game so if you see a huge foe and reckon it likely to crush you the game might well reward you for staying out of the fight until you better equipped to take it onwhen you start the game alongside a class you be able to select a oneoff keepsake that you start the game with these are worth searching the web about because they each bring interesting benefits but if you keen to just breeze through our top pick for a beginner would be the golden seedthis will let you add a charge to your healing flask really early on in the game and while you find more down the line having that early safety net is worth its weight in gold in our opinionin the early phases of the game there are a couple of locations hiding items that are really valuable and useful but which you can easily breeze past if you not careful here one after you get your horse torrent be sure to visit the church of elleh site of grace at night you find a new npc there with a valuable item for youfor another example the gatefront ruins that you run into patrolled by a bunch of enemies also has a small basement room to find down some stairsin it you find an item to unlock a mechanic called the ashes of war to help you make your weapons take on new attributes it something that we missed multiple times as we cleared the ruins and serves up another valuable lesson keep your eyes peeled and check every corneranother way to get a bit of information about the lands between is to buy notes from merchants you come across in the wilds some of them in truly unlikely locations these scraps of information might hold the key to felling frightful enemies or to finding nearby hidden locations it way more rewarding than looking things up on the webfrom the very first merchant you meet in the church of elleh you can get a note that point you toward the third church of marika for example a ruined church where you find the flask of wondrous physick this reusable flask is a hugely useful item throughout the entire game and lets you augment your character nicely so make sure you don miss it entirelylike the souls games before it elden ring has you collecting xp from enemies as you vanquish them but if you die you risk losing it all only if you get to the spot where you died in the next life can you reclaim your progress which doubles as currency as wellit a classic riskreward mechanic but all we can say is that if you collected enough runes to level up a couple of times then you should be wary of pushing into dangerous or unknown fights fasttravelling to a save point to level up and bank that progress might be the more sensible optionthere will come multiple points in elden ring where you feel outmatched and just want to gain some levels to get more powerful before a big fight or a new area finding an area where you comfortable in winning your duels and then getting proper rewards is a big part of that grind and farming runes in this manner is nothing to be ashamed ofearly on in the game you find that the most reliably bighitters in terms of rune rewards are the huge lumbering trolls that roam around parts of limgrave in particular there a field with a few of them in it in the stormhill area in the north of the map these guys hit really hard when you at a lower level but are manageable with some nimble movement on torrent back and each one will net you souls that a fair whack so this is a great place to stock upelden ring offers you two ways to summon help while you in challenging areas spirit ashes and coop summons the first you find as you move around the world and beat certain bosses and bring in spectral helpers to distract enemies from you they super useful and a few of the more powerful ones are huge boostsalso enormously helpful is the option to bring in players themselves up to two can be summoned by using an item called a furlcalling finger remedy you can buy the recipe to craft it from the first merchant you meet in the game and using it lets you see players summon signs and call on them trust us if you stuck on a big boss use a remedy outside the entrance and see who you can bring in to help it a gamechangerby setting the same multiplayer password in our settings we also been able to drop into the game with friends stuck in early areas to use our endgame characters to help them steamroll through if they in danger of getting burnt out by the difficulty of a certain boss or enemy this is a great way to ease their progressbest games all the playstation titles every gamer should play by max freemanmills may only risk is that when you have coop help you can also be invaded by hostile players so if you want to fight a boss we recommend rushing into the arena once your summons arrive to reduce the chances of thisequipping items to your quick select menu lets you access them using down on your dpad but if you have a lot equipped you often find yourself frantically tapping through to get back to your healing potions this can easily be avoided holding down the button will skip you straight to whatever is in the first slot a huge help in frantic fightssimilarly don neglect your pockets which you access by holding triangle or y then tapping on your dpad having your horse whistle on one of these is a must once you get it and other frequently used items make a case for inclusion as wellthe first map ever in a souls game is a real boon in elden ring not just because it makes it easier to navigate the world but because it one that you can mark ingame firstly hitting cross or a on the map will put down a blue beacon that you can see in the world to guide you around which is great for directionssecondly though you can hit square or x to put down a themed green marker on the map which can be a great way to keep track of things like walking mausoleums you might encounter and want to use later thankfully a postlaunch update means the map now lists where npcs are for you which makes it much easier to know where to gofinally pay attention to certain designs on the map they fairly consistent and can give you clues as to where you might find dungeons for example all mines have the same drawing on the map a little hole in the ground these can yield superhelpful upgrade materials,en,487.0,Positive

be much clearer now and you can also finally see how many times you died a key stat that was missing dice has also been playing with aim assist for controller players to make your shooting experience feel smoother which is always welcomethat was the main thrust of this update though it was all about the scoreboard and not much elsethe previous major update for was a while back dice published its blog post unveiling the changes which weren quite as voluminous as in previous iterations but contained some significant and welcome tweaksupdate for goes live tomorrow december across all platforms at utcno downtime is expected we keep you updated during rolloutupdate notes pictwittercomqalrlfoijofor us most important was the removal of rooftop capture points from the three maps that featured them in breakthrough these were practically broken if you were attackers and the game should now flow far more fairly without themanother big balance change came for proximity sensors which were far too universally used they had their ping radius narrowed their duration halved and you can now only carry one instead of two which should prioritise other throwables nicelythe cannons for most vehicles took another nerf reducing their splash damage to try to give infantry more of a chance which has been a theme since launch and is still welcome while most weapons had some more tuning done to make recoil feel betterdice also says that hit registration should again get a marked improvement although in all honesty we had few problems with it since the last couple of updates those are the headline changes but you can read the blog post to find out more in detailbefore update came unsurprisingly you can find a huge blog post detailing all of of its changes right heretomorrow update for goes live across all platforms at utc it our biggest update yet with plenty of fixes improvements and qol enhancements no downtime is expected we keep you updated during rolloutupdate notes are way too many details to list them all but perhaps the biggest came in the form of new weekly missions assignments you get each week that award xp when finished to help you level up finishing all your weekly tasks will grant you a unique cosmetic seemingly so you want to log in each week to try them outanother big change brought back the old system of revives when you die you see any medics who could revive you within metres so that you can have a sense for whether you likely to be coming reasons why the redmagic is a sublime gaming phone by pocketlint promotion may medics can ping downed players to let them know they on their way just like in older battlefield games that a welcome addition that we were confused to see left out in the first placethere were loads of bug fixes to make sure that weapons and equipment are working as designed including a tweak to stop the sniper scope from zooming in so ridiculously quickly we miss you also says it improved navigation around your collection in a few ways too to let you edit your loadouts and weapons in fewer clicks it a slightly arcane system at present and takes some getting used to so this is no bad thingwhat there wasn a huge amount of in this update is balance changes in terms of boosts and nerfs for weapons and vehicles themselvesat the end of the first week of life cycle dice broke cover to confirm that it been listening to all the feedback flooding in both positive and negative from newcomers and longtime fans of the seriesin a frankly huge blog post it detailed a massive raft of changes that it going to bring to battlefield in a series of updates the first one having launched on november and with another two planned before christmas can find everything that changed in granular detail on the ea website here but there are some headline changes that you want to know aboutfirstly a wide array of weapons have had their recoil and bullet spread adjusted to be more forgiving which should make shooting easier for a lot of players across the board similarly the dreaded smg has had its recoil increased to make it less devastating at long rangemultiple vehicles have had their weaponry adjusted to reduce their dominance while the hovercraft has also had its armour reduced to make it less of a beast to fight againstfinally there also a fix for the bug that stopped players from being revived

mentioned as you need to set up a defensive perimeter to survive a new trailer has appeared showing off and confirming all these detailsthere an older rumour that still out there there are slots in the loadout of a recent beta where you could potentially change some elements of your character skinthere are loads of backpacks but the other slots have often not been used in the may community update it was mentioned that these would be used in the next update suggesting you be able to get unique helmets and body items to customise your characters further but so far we not seen this happenthere a water theme with characters and of battle pass elements related to that so it fitting that some of the new maps fit in with water you got a couple of docks incomingthe first big tease was bathed in sunset and was clearly a dock and indeed it is with the new suldal harbor map confirmed this is a midsized map that designed for and gameplay and you find tight spaces shipping crates and lots of cqb action the suldal harbor map was in the original call of dutythe next teaser was for docks which was easily recognised and now confirmedthis is clearly the gunfight map set in london docks it a small mapmoving along from the docks we getting aniyah incursion from modern warfare this will let you see the luxurious interior of the palace with running battles through the various rooms as well as in the surrounding grounds it going to feature in battles as well as new ground mission mode and attack of the undeadthere are two new weapons coming in season then salvage it will be as good as newcoming soon to much has been said about the first of these but it the shorty shotgun that you be able to get through a seasonal challengethe second weapon is the amax and that has been confirmed and this will be unlocked in the free battle pass at tier it not a weapon there a new operator skill the unit which you be able to unlock at tier will also be a gungho perk to bring a speed boost and better skills while sprinting there also going to be a time traveler class in battle royale so you can jump back in time which you can see working in the video belowthe game modes will take a twist on some we seen before we already spotted the return of multiplayer which is very welcomed with those new maps also providing more grounds to play at oncranked confirmed is exactly what it sounds like cranked and kill confirmed mashed together into a new game mode while ground mission is a version of domination with five capture points which sounds pretty trickythe new themed event is sea of steel where you have to pick a side in the naval battle as with other such events it mostly about playing the game and then seeing what you get at the end thanks to the eventit has now been confirmed what coming to season of call of duty mobile which is called spurned and burned it a wild west theme and there some tiein with that with the introduction of a new winchester action rifle always associated with the wild west new duels as well as characters from the old west too if that your thingon may we saw the update for the game and that brought in the action heroes to get people started and for some fun between seasonsthere been plenty of teasing around this the introduction of action heroes to call of duty and not just mobile but warzone and cold war too the addition of rambo was the first big tease and pretty obvious but the second tease has been for john mcclane from die hard these arrived in the may update with both rambo and john mcclane available to buy in the store as well as a game mode where you can become those characters for a brief timethey very op and it a bit of fun but we suspect most who want those characters will end up paying for themglass who gives a sht about glass new confirmed map is dome this is a multiplayer map that was seen in modern warfare a small map based around a nato base the dome being an old radar domesearchingsignal foundcoming in the next season to the nakatomi plaza building shown on one of the teaser images as well as the reference to glass from die hard there some speculation that we could see something based around nakatomi plaza in season to give john mcclane somewhere to show off his skills this doens appear to be in the game but the building is on the verdansk map in warzonethere are two new weapons coming in season both confirmed that a new rifle and a new lmg there also an update to gunsmith so you see some pretty big changes therethe lmg is the holger of which there will also be a mythic

everthing that it includesit been confirmed that the bizon will be making its way to call of duty mobile this is a popular smg in pubg mobile so it great to see it appearing in the mobile version of call of duty the bizon is best known for its high rate of fire and large magazine capacity so is likely to be a winner on small maps in close combatlook familiar can you guess what weapon this isyou can expect it to arrive in the next season of isn the only new weapon we expecting it been confirmed that there will also be a new secondary weapon appearing in season and that pistol has been revealeda new pistol is making its way to the next seasoncan you guess what it iscoming soon to the renetti best known because it will fire threeround bursts with the right attachment it a pistol and we can see it will be popular with those wanting a fast fire rate from a secondary weapon although we suspect you have to develop this weapon in gunsmith to get the best from iton top of these new

pocket-lint,2022/05/04,https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/news/warner/151737-batman-games-order-arkham-telltale-lego-timeline-how-to,What order should you play the Batman Arkham games?,pocketlint there have been many batman games over the years from the brightly coloured exploits inspired by the animated series to the telltale adventures that brought the comic books to lifehowever one series has stood high above the others recognised by many as truly capturing the heart and soul of batman it has even been rightly acknowledged as the best superhero series to bootwe refer of course to the batman arkham games which have graced our consoles computers phones tablets and even vr headsets for the best part of years and with a new chapter heading our way called gotham knights what better time to revisit them than right nowbetter still why not revisit them in order not as per their release dates but by following the story timelinehere we put the arkham games in order of what to play first if you want to follow the story so faroriginally released after arkham city origins puts you in the bat boots of a young bruce wayne as he battles numerous assassins out to kill him plus black mask who serves as the main villain in the game oh and it also features this universe batman meeting the mysterious joker for the first timethe game was developed by wb games montral rather than rocksteady so failed to match up to the standards set by the more recognised arkham trilogy however it still presents a decent adventure and is a great place to startthe mobile version of arkham origins effectively follows the plot of the main game but essentially ditches the story elements and focuses on fights between batman and some of the main foesa series of swipes and taps help you through the battles and er that about it you can no longer download it these days anywayblackgate was originally designed for handheld platforms vita and so switched the gameplay to a fightingplatformer that actually does a good job of translating some of the combat moves for a more simple formatit is set after the events in origins itself with batman revisiting the blackgate prisonthis is the game that effectively started the whole shebang based entirely within the walls of arkham asylum after most prisoners have escaped their cells and taken over the game was and still is an ideal antidote to all the brightlycoloured superhero adventures that came beforewhat stands out most apart from the excellent freeflowing combat system is that every nook and cranny is filled with collectables and secrets ensuring play lasts longer than just the story it now part of a return to arkham pack remastered and tweaked for the current generation consolesalso available in the return to arkham pack batman arkham city is arguably the best of the bunch it switches the action from the confined location of the asylum to the streets of arkham city a section of gotham city fenced in and designated a superprisonthe more open world nature of the sequel makes for some great moments not least the ability to glide around a huge landscape swooping down on the criminals belowsadly like the mobile version of origins you can no longer get hold of arkham city lockdown on itunes or google playwhen you could it again presented more of a beatemup with swipes and taps needed to

royale is the biggest game in the world and has been for some time and we not just counting player numbers but also sheer popcultural power bedrooms and living rooms in homes around the globe are resonating with the sound of automatic weapon fire the clanks and thwops of crafting and teenage exclamations at suddenly dyingwhile the game is built around the need to hone your skills and reaction times there are a few things i wish id known before i started playing they might just help you out toofortnite battle royale matches start with a bang its really important to get a good range of gear as fast as you can regardless of what guns are actually your favourite to use aim to land near buildings that you can search for loot before other players get to themthen as you progress be sure to manage your guns ammunition and medkits you need to hoard as many of these as you can but you also need to know when you running low on bullets so you can change upalthough you can of course build your own cover its essential to use your natural surroundings in fortnite to get cover and outmanoeuvre enemies always be aware of vantage points that can be used to snipe you maintaining a better line of sight to other players will give you the upper handat the same time be aware of where the storm is at all times and how the circle is moving this not only ensures you arent forced out of your hiding place but can mean you ready to pick off other players who have been caught outone of the joys of fortnite is that no two games are the same you will no doubt have favourite weapons and locations in the game but dont get too wedded to one style of play you need to be able to adjust your tactics to the situation you find yourself inthis means that keeping a varied inventory of weapons potions tools and medkits is important you never know what you will stumble upon around the next corner so having a wide arsenal to draw from will stand you in good steadthis is true of all battle royale games really you have to develop a sense of patience this applies quite widely it can mean during a match when you got to play it cool and make sure to only engage other players when you think you have the other handit can also be about your attitude to fortnite as a whole though battle royale games with their large pools of players are hard to win and you often go quite a while between victory royales maintaining your focus and not getting frustrated is a skill in itself one you can developfortnite is a game about outwitting the other players you might do this by sniping someone from higher ground but there are many other less reputable ways to win laying traps is a great way to do away with an unsuspecting player using loot to lure players into traps is a nice trickbuilding can also help you outsmart other players if you are being targeted building is a great first response in fact it pretty much necessary but as soon as you do you could give your position away to other combatants a good tip is to build a big structure and then move away from it and wait for the other player to come and investigate once they are in your sights you can take them downplaying fortnite to win means paying attention to your surroundings in the real world as much as in the game its essential that you dont get interrupted or distracted by younger siblings or parents telling you its dinner time make sure you have enough time to play the game for a good stretch so you can get into your groovehaving a good headset will also help you communicate with teammates as well as hear whats going on around you in the game being able to hear the footsteps of another player clearly can make the difference between life and deathif you are on a losing streak dont just belligerently keep at it getting more and more irate take a break play something else go outside maybe when you return youll be fresh and ready to goif you looted or entered a house and leave the door open its a clear sign to other players that you in there this is battle royale people because of this its advisable to close the door behind you once youve gone indoors can also be used if left open to lure other players into a structure some teams also agree a door protocol where they leave doors open to indicate that theyve looted the house and save teammates timewhen playing in teams its important that you can communicate quickly and efficiently therefore make sure you know the names of the main locations on the map and discuss rally points as you parachute downplayers also develop words to quickly indicate

sequel,pocketlint sometimes a game feels like it came out a heck of a lot more recently than it did and the elder scrolls v skyrim has to be right up there on that list countless rereleases and ports of the game have masked the fact that it been years since it first came outwhile skyrim has come to currentgen consoles with visual upgrades and been translated into a superlative vr experience there not much you can do to dim fans anticipation for the next game in the longrunning elder scrolls series best of all we know that developer bethesda is in some form working on it although its release sounds like it could be a long while offwe gathered everything we know about the elder scrolls vi right here for your browsing pleasure regardlessthe trailer we embedded above is about as official as news has come regarding the elder scrolls it was shown off by bethesda at back in to a huge reception fans understandably got insanely excited about the possibility that they be adventuring around a new game world within a couple of yearswell time makes fools of us all and since then there been nary a peep about the game our hopes and dreams for a launch are now in tatters and the old tidbits of information aren going to matter pete hines is basically the top messaging and marketing bod at bethesda and dropped this bombshell when asked by a fan on twitter for details on the game along while backits after starfield which you pretty much know nothing about so if youre coming at me for details now and not years from now im failing to properly manage your expectationswe don want to alarm anyone but people have rightly concluded from this that if we years from even hearingabout the elder scrolls we even further from being able to play it the fact is that bethesda is concentrating on its new ip starfield for the moment and that game only comes out in late if we tentatively say that could be a possible release window for the next game we hope that not too disappointing and frankly feels like a more likely possibilityeven if it a while away though we can still make some educated guesses about the content of the game thankfully for one thing it almost guaranteed to be set in tamriel the fictional continent that housed every elder scrolls game so far and which is made up of multiple regions which have changed over the course of its historymany previous the elder scrolls games adopt these regions in their very names skyrim morrowind and so on so it widely assumed that will follow suit but what will the name and setting be there are a number of options valenwood elsweyr akavir and more but our prediction is that it will go one of three waysthe first major option is black marsh the most southeastern area of tamriel which gives the game opportunity to explore a different landscape than the frosted lands of skyrim it home to the argonian lizardpeople which make up one of tamriel races there a certain ring to the name too which always helps when selling multimilliondollar gaming franchisesanother option though is informed by the trailer bethesda released above it looks like a pretty arid climate which could make it the home of the khajit feline humanoids that have become fan favourites that would see the game set inelsweyrfinally a recent frontrunner is a theory that hammerfell is where we end up fuelled by a fresh and cryptic tweet from the series official twitter handletranscribe the past and map the future here to a happy new year the oddlyplaced candles and the presence of hammerfell to skyrim south people are getting convinced this hints at the next major game setting for now though this is all sadly speculation with no official information likely for some time all while elder scrolls online continues to explore tamriel meaning that teasers could well be for new expansions for the mmo not a new gameof course outside of its setting there still huge variety in what sort of story the game could tell will we get another tale of a fallen god seeking rebirth or a longrumoured doom returning to peaceful lands it hard to tell at this stagewhat we can be much more confident about is what platforms the game is likely to come to we can now be fairly sure that it a nextgen only title while the and xbox one could still be getting new games in a couple of years time we doubt they be able to handle what bethesda cooks up graphicallyhowever the elephant in the room here is that bethesda is now owned by microsoft so coming to is no longer on the table a recent roundtable saw phil spencer say that bethesda games would be exclusive to platforms that can host game passthat means that right now we can only really see the game arriving on a few platforms xbox series x series s and pc on top of that the announcement that bethesda next game starfield won come to playstation makes it all but guaranteed that the same it true for the elder scrollsalthough the nintendo switch did get the requisite port of skyrim too it looks more than a little ropey in places so we think it a safe assumption that barring any big hardware changes from nintendo its super little console won be able to handle the new elder scrolls gamewhen it comes to gameplay there are also some safe assumptions that we can make about what you can expect from regardless of setting it almost certainly be a traditional roleplaying game that lets you choose your adventurer and route through the game world you be able to play in firstperson and thirdperson modes and could create a spellcaster warrior slicktongued thief or stealthy assassin or any other combination of traitsthere will be a main quest that concerns itself with seismic continental events but also countless smaller less timeconsuming errands and investigations to embark upon adding up to a game world that has an endlessfeeling amount of content for new players to discover does that cover everythingbest games all the playstation titles every gamer should play by max freemanmills may though there are obviously unknowns about what bethesda could change about its systems whether in the form of a more indepth magic system stealth that a bit more involved or even an overhauled combat system with a bit more responsivenessplus we heard late last year that bethesda is overhauling its entire gameplay engine to cater to the game so we could end up with something far less familiar than you might thinkgiven bethesda mixed results in the world of online gaming too with the elder scrolls online doing well and fallout less so there also a question mark over whether the developer will seek to add in any online elements we think this is slightly unlikely at least as far as fullon multiplayer is concerned given the heritage of the mainline games but anything is

there are three different storage tiers available though emmc storage nvme ssd storage and of highspeed nvme ssd storage you can also expand the storage via microsd on any of the models the steam deck boasts of unified memory with a total of of bandwidth the gpu will apparently have access to up to of that shared memoryother features include builtin mics a gyroscope for motion controls and a watthour battery that provides several hours of playtime for most games valve says the steam deck can charge and play at the same and will come with a power supply we also now heard that it be targetting on games as the minimum expected performance although that surely vary by titleit has a usbc port which offers external display support for up to two monitors at that also means steam deck supports amd fidelityfx super resolution for upscaling similar to nvidia dlsssteam deck has two thumbsticks and two steam controllerstyle trackpads beneath the thumbstick that can mimic the feeling of

the right cables the stem deck comes with usbc ports that contain hdmi ethernet and usb data as well as bluetoothvalve is keen to make sure that as many games as possible are playable on the steam deckthe company has said that many games will run out of the box but it also been working with developers to ensure there plenty of compatibilityvalve has created the steam deck compatibility program to verify which games will and won work with the console you be able to use this to see which games work with various labels these labels include verified where the games will work as they should right away playable where they might need manual controller tweaks unsupported where the games won work on steam deck and unknown where the game hasn been testedthe officially verified games will no doubt increase over time in the meantime one fan has created a list of compatible games based on data pulled from the steam database that list shows there are currently over games that have been tested so far the testing includes everything from ensuring text is readable to the controls being functionalobviously this is going to be an important system for ensuring games are working before you buynaturally steam deck is designed to primarily work with steam and games from that library but because steam deck runs on linux it will also potentially support other things one of those things is games in your epic games libraryyou might need to do a workaround though there a games launcher called heroic which is open source and runs linux compatible games including games from the epic games storeit will theoretically be possible to install this and then use that to launch your gameson the faq pages valve has answered a number of burning questionsno that doesn make much sense to us it a pc and it should just play games like a pcwe support two when using the onboard speakers but we support multichannel when using hdmi or bluetoothtop nintendo switch games best switch titles every

on workload the gpu can access up to gbwe are focused on providing you the full performance available from the apu both on battery and when you plugged in our expectation is that performance is the same across the board in either configurationthe steam deck will automatically run games in fullscreen by default however if you drop to desktop you can run games in windowed modetechnically it possible we seen people jury rig it but we didn design and optimize steam deck for vrfsr is already available for some applications that support it games that already include fsr will work as is but also fsr support will be included as part of an os future release once that happens games could potentially make use of fsr even if the games themselves don natively support itdefinitely you can play local coop on the steam deck in a few different ways you can hook controllers in via bluetooth or directly via usb you can also play with remote play together where other players are on other decks or pcswe still finalizing plans with a bunch of other countries and territories nothing solid to announce or confirm yet but we can say that we working really hard on making steam deck available in japan

most from your console,pocketlint the nintendo switch has been a massive success since its launch in spring and still regularly sells out across multiple retailers even after the launch of the and xbox series x it now has new versions in the form of the switch lite and switch oled tooit has also played host to some amazing games including the legend of zelda breath of the wild super mario odyssey and super smash bros ultimate with more to comebut if you have your own switch what else can you do with it than play games and what tips and tricks can you learn to make the experience better read onif you a parent and you bought a child a nintendo switch or expect it to be played by all the family there are some great ways to set age restrictions and communication options for younger kids nintendo provides parental controls on the console itself and through a separate application for ios and androidhere how to set them upwhen you first start up your nintendo switch you are asked to set up a profile choose an icon and even setup a nintendo store accountif you want to change your avatar later on though all you have to do is head to your profile page by tapping on your icon in the topleft of the screen heading down to user settings and to edit icon there you will find plenty of nintendo characters to choose from or you can select or create a miithe nintendo switch is not regionlocked so you can technically buy games anywhere in the world and play them on your console regardless of originhowever if you buy a digital redemption code from another country you will need to jump through a few hoops to get it to workfirst you must set up a profile based in the country the game is from only profiles from a certain country can enter the specific online eshop to redeem that country code luckily it is free and doesn impact your main profilehead to system settings and then down to user tap on add new user and it will ask you to set an icon and nickname for the new profile once done you will need to register a new user online via a smartphone tablet or pc you will be guided through the process with the console and the online website giving you instructionsmake sure you have a spare email address to hand as it requires verification also ensure you choose the profile country correctly ie the country the game is fromonce created you can log into the eshop on your switch using the new profile and you see the currency has been changed you can redeem your code from the menu option on the sidebarthe beauty is once a game is downloaded it can be played by any of the profiles on the switch so you can use your original username the one thing you must remember is that if you delete the madeup profile you will lose access to the downloaded game assigned to ityou will need to subscribe to nintendo switch online to play the vast majority of online multiplayer games it costs per month or for three months for a are free to play online and do not require membership such as fortnite but most arenyou will also need to add trusted friends to play against them directly onlinethis is done by adding those you have previously played with on other nintendo consoles or through a friend code a unique code that a friend can give you likewise you can give a friend your code in returnit can be found on your profile page on your console annoyingly you can find this online on your phone or computer to add a friend code you must go to the add friend option in the profile settings and tap search with friend codethere is a microsd card slot underneath the rear kickstand on the console and we thoroughly advise you to buy a card to pop into it or you will soon run out of storage spacegames on nintendo switch even if you have bought cartridge versions can take up several gigabytes the elder scrolls skyrim for example takes up more than and considering that the switch only has of internal storage on the switch oled with little over of that useable that one game will fill up more than half the drivethe digital version of la noire requires on its own so you will need a microsd card just to download and play itthankfully the switch can accept many types of microsd cards and they needn break the supports microsd microsdhc and microsdxc standards up to uhsi classification the faster the card the better the performance but we use the above samsung evo card and it does the trick beautifully without costing too much other storage sizes are available toothe beauty of the nintendo switch is that as well as play it on a big screen at home you can also play with it on your travels you will find the battery life a little constrictive in that case however with the average lifespan of a single charge being between three and four hours of playthere are ways to eke out the battery a bit more though by adjusting the brightness of the screen on the settings page the console has an automatic brightness setting which is on by default but you can choose to turn it off and slide the brightness down to conserve battery lifeyou can also choose to disable controller vibration in the system settings under controllers and sensors which will also help conserve battery lifeif you plan a lengthy train or plane ride you are best to make sure you also have a portable battery pack to hand in order to charge your console on the move thankfully you can get one on the cheap these days and considering the switch has a battery inside many of them will charge your console two times or more before needing to be charged again themselvesthe nature of the switch portability means it slightly at risk you be taking it in and out of its dock constantly and carrying it around all over the place our first big recommendation is to pick up a screen protector which doesn need to be expensive at used these protectors from amfilm and they easy to apply and reliable we been saved from multiple crackings and scratchings by them which is really all you can ask case is also a good idea if you going to take advantage of the switch adaptability we like this slimline offering from tomtoc which will keep the essentials safe while you travel around other larger cases are available to pack in more accessories and controllersthere nothing like buying a game downloading it and being able to play anytime you like without having to dig out the cartridge but there are a few benefits to buying the physical copies rather than using the nintendo eshopthe first is price games on the nintendo eshop can often be much more expensive than on amazon for examplesecond depending on your broadband speed at home games can take a while to download and install even some physical copies require part of the game to download anyway plus updates and day one patches but a couple of gigs will take less time than or morelastly as we explain above digital downloads can require a lot of storage space and if you don have a beefy microsd card you will fill the capacity the included joycons work well as a separate controller with the grip we advise you to treat yourself to a pro controller if you plan to play games on a big screen when dockednaturally motion games don really require one but games such as zelda breath of the wild and skyrim play better with the official controlleranother purchase you might want to consider if you plan to play your switch in more than one room is a second dock yes the switch itself comes with a screen and is portable but should you want to play it on different televisions in say the living room and a bedroom an additional dock is a better solution than moving the included one around all the timeyou can buy the official nintendo version for around but there are other thirdparty versions also available for less sometimes more than half the price just make sure you opt for one with a chip or motherboard listed in the description otherwise it will charge your console but not output video to a tvanother option to make sure that even when you out and about tv play is within your grasp is to buy a portable docking option these let you plug into a tv in a pinch without needing a dock to sit in and are a great way to get hooked up without needing a bulky dock on you they also nice and switch has been out long enough that there are absolutely myriad accessories out there for the console official and otherwise if you want bluetooth audio or steering wheel grips or cases that boost its battery you can find all of those and more out therehandily we got a list of some of the best switch accessories

completely new a totally fresh sciencefiction ipthe game called starfield that much we know and you in the perfect place to find out everything we know about the upcoming titlebethesda unveiled starfield at in with the above teaser trailer that gives us very little to go on it only a minute long that evocative name set the rumour mill going into overdrive but there was no release date to go with itnow though we finally got a date at bethesda opened xbox presentation with a longer trailer for the game and confirmed its release date as november means the game is still a good way off but we got a date to look forward to at leastearly rumours suggest the game may have a collector edition release coming with a fully functional smartwatch in a presentation boxwhat would have been a simple bit of estimation over the course of years has become more complicated when it comes to the game likely platforms after all microsoft recently completed its blockbuster purchase of bethesda and bigname exclusives will surely have been one major motivator behind thatthat why it wasn a great surprise to get confirmation that the game will be exclusive to xbox consoles and pc when it releases starfield will not be appearing on the or to the good side of that information the game will also release straight onto xbox game pass so if you a subscriber to that service you be able to play it at no additional cost immediatelyeven after two trailers we still arguably know next to nothing about starfield with only hints given out by that pair of clips the original teaser shows a planet before revealing a satellite that unfolds and zips through some sort of cosmic wormhole or gatethe word constellation appears partially at the start too and it also comes back in the second trailer this time referred to as a group of people todd howard confirmed in an interview with the telegraph that this group is key to the story calling them a last group of space explorersthe group is apparently one of several factions that the player will interact with in the game a familar concept to lovers of bethesda previous rpgs we had short vignettes from the developer about some of the settlements that you visit in starfield including new atlantis below as well as neon and akilathe clips are super short and only contain animated concept art but they still give some hints about how the world of starfield might operate so it well worth checking them outwhether this all sees us taking on the role of a spacefarer or astronaut and the sort of story the game will tell will both have to come out with time bethesda obviously specialises in openworld rpgs so we also suspect that it likely to fit into a similar mouldwe know that you make a custom character though as confirmed during a reddit discussion the game will let you choose your pronouns and gender with dialogue recorded to support whatever choices you opt for a nice inclusive touchthe rickety nature of that satellite in the first teaser and some older quotes from bethesda supremo todd howard make it sound like space travel will not be some easy feat in starfield though talking to elon musk in howard compared it to flight in the like it dangerous so we hoping there could be some interesting mechanics on that frontin a few of the trailers and clips released so far you can see glimpses of a tall robot that looks like a companion for the player and that now been confirmed in the short trailer belowit called vasco and can accompany the player as they explore offering more storage and even a gentle bit of protection if fighting does break out the robot distinctive design is impressive and we be interested to see what further gameplay implications vasco haslooking further back after a good chunk of radio silence in late a couple of images surfaced out of nowhere purporting to be from prerelease starfield builds there no proof of this and only some similarities in the ui design compared to the official starfield website to back it upthese new keyboards by logitech have our favourite emojis built in and we love them by pocketlint promotion may not much to go on but it looks like it confirms a few details including the

pocket-lint,2022/05/04,https://www.pocket-lint.com/games/news/google/143589-google-stadia-explained-price-release-date-games-list,"What is Google Stadia, how much does it cost and what do you need?",pocketlint google cloud gaming platform is available across countries including the uk and us in its paid and free formscalled stadia it is the company netflix ofgames of sorts with games hosted on remote servers and video streamed to connected devices including smartphones tablets computers and tvsbut what does stadia offer and how does it differ from other cloud gaming servicesgoogle stadia is a cloud gaming servicewhereby games can be purchased and played but don have to be downloaded to a console or pcthat because through multiple connected devices including phones laptops and tvs you play the game in real time but it actually run on a remote stadia server somewhere else in the world the video of the gameplay is transmitted to your device over the internet while the control codes from a game controller are sent in the other directionthe biggest hurdle other similar services have encountered over the years is latency the time it takes from the moment you move the controller thumbstick or press a button to the action occurring on screenbut where stadia differs from some other platforms such as nvidia geforce now and playstation now is that its servers are placed in a vast number of locations around the globe that shortens the distance between player and a server to stream fromin addition google has developed a dedicated stadia controller that connects to the internet directly via wifi rather than your device when you are playing at home at least that means it sends controller codes without having to submit them to your phone tablet or other connected device first that cuts down on milliseconds of latency and in gaming that really mattersusually on a cloud gaming platform once you pressed a button the signal has to be transmitted most often through bluetooth to the receiving device then sent over an internet connection it is subsequently read by the source device sent back to the receiving device then transmitted to your tv if not using a smartphone or tablet screen each of these actions take time and that can be vital to smooth gaming experiences as milliseconds can be the difference between avoiding a bullet or being shot in the faceit also works with many thirdparty bluetooth controllers including the xbox wireless controller but they could introduce a little extra latency in comparison with the official controllergoogle stadia doesn need a dedicated device as it is playable through existing connected devicesfor computer use stadia works through the google chrome internet browser it is therefore available on pc mac and chromebooks without extra dedicated software or devicesit can also be found on select smart tvs including some from lg and hisense models featuring android tv such as those from sony or philips can also access the stadia appalternatively you can add an nvidia shield tv to your setup as that carries android tv too other android tv settopboxes may be compatibleof course google own chromecast ultra and chromecast with google tv can be used to play stadia games as wellin terms of mobile use both android and ios are supported although the latter requires a bit of a work aroundall android phones are compatible although many only work in experiment mode that means they aren officially supported unless they are on the optimised phone list below so could exhibit some bugsas well as the dedicated stadia controller compatible phone users can link an xbox wireless controller or playstation dualshock controller to their device via bluetooth to play stadia gamestouch controls are also now available when playing games on mobile devices although the more complicated games are hard to play using the screenin october google officially added the ability to play stadia games over a or
