nintendo switch lucky you or maybe you got one for someone else and want to help them make the most of it how kind in either case here are some good things to know after you open up everyones favorite portable hybrid consolewhile the switch is pretty easy to set up and straightforward to use there are some tricks that will make the whole experience even better from increasing battery life to saving time clicking through the eshop im going to assume that if youre reading this youve already gone through the initial process of booting your switch up making a user profile and connecting it to a nintendo account if you havent go do that if you have then do these things nextno matter how careful or delicate you think you are you will nick the screen i promise you you might knock it over by accident at one point maybe you have a cat who will swat at it and if nothing else you will probably move it in and out of the dock a few times during its lifespan which can also scuff up the display you can avoid lasting consequences to each of these incidents by purchasing a screen protector hori makes an economical but effective plastic one there are a bunch of other options as well carrying cases are a nice way to provide some added protection as welleven if youre the only person who will be playing your new switch do yourself a favor and make an extra user profile bonus points if you set its region to japan some games only allow one save file per account having an easily accessible alternative will give you more options and if its set to japan it will unlock additional games and demos that havent made it to north america yet including some in switch onlines subscriptionbased retro libraryplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingunless you love accosting your eyeballs go into the settings menu and turn off the bright white background it will be more soothing and also cut down on unnecessary battery usagethis ones another nobrainer unless you are sitting on the beach odds are you dont need your switchs display projecting at full strength if youre in a dark room turn the brightness all the way down the autobrightness setting works well for everywhere elsethis is the third tip related to battery life which should tell you how important it is to maximize the limited juice your handheld has access to want to play the legend of zelda breath of the wild in the park like that guy in the commercial turn on airplane mode to disable unnecessary features like wifi and bluetooth itll prolong battery life and is easy to toggle back and forth at a moments notice from the settings menuthe switch will make you type in your password every time you just want to log onto the eshop unless you disable it to do that open the eshop select your profile icon on the top right click through to your account information and update the passwordentry settingsthe switchs library of freetoplay games isnt as deep as some platforms but theres still plenty you can get your hands on and start enjoying right away without spending a cent here are the top three recommendations in that departmentthere are some other decent options as well including the platform fighter brawlhalla alternative battle royale shooter apex legends and hearthstoneesque card game eternalfree games are great but the switch has a lot of other great experiences to offer as well in addition to stellar firstparty games like mario kart deluxe and animal crossing new horizons its also been loaded up with ports of blockbusters and indie games alike as well as remasters and reissues of older nintendo games the great deals tab on the eshop menu will show you the biggest games that are on sale on any given day and the wishlist feature will let you keep tabs on stuff youre interested in and then alert you if and when it ever drops in priceonce youre ready to throw some bones nintendos way you cant go wrong with any of the games on kotakus switch bests list the lists of bestselling indie games on switch in recent years are also good places to startthe switch didnt launch with cloud saves but it has them now thanks to switch online unfortunately the paid subscription service will cost you a year but it might be worth it if you plan on investing a lot of time into offline games like breath of the wild or super mario odyssey in the months and years to come that way even if your switch is stolen breaks or otherwise becomes unsalvageable your save data wont meet a similar fatethe switch online expansion pack still isnt worth the extra but with dozens of the best nes and snes games ever released the base subscription tier is worth trying at the three months for entry point if and when you ever let your switch online subscription lapse youll have days to renew it before whatever saves you had stored in the cloud get deletednearly four years out the switchs social features remain critically underdeveloped but that doesnt mean they dont exist at all while theres no party chat youll need to rely on ingame chat features or discord you can still friend other players and see what theyve been playing theres even a trending section which will let you know if say your pals have all come down with a case of mario tennis fever nintendos console will let you link facebook and twitter accounts to quickly scour those platforms for mutuals who are also on switchthe joycon are very cute and come in all sorts of different colors unfortunately they also suck to play games with a clever way to get more gamepads into peoples hands for irl gaming sessions they may cause cramping in your hands after a while and will almost certainly start to experience drift malfunctioning at some point theyre fine in the beginning and serviceable enough in handheld mode but you will not regret upgrading to a switch pro controller you can also get an xbox series x controller my personal favorite to work with the switch by purchasing a cheap thirdparty dongle and if you want a cheaper more versatile option the pro is still excellent and only it go enjoy your switch now and if you decide to ignore all of this advice for the love of god please still put a screen protector on it,en,307.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/how-to-unlock-all-six-hidden-weapon-aspects-in-hades-1845317453,How To Unlock All Six Hidden Weapon Aspects In Hades,hades the greek mythologythemed actionroguelike from supergiant games ostensibly gives you six weapons to play with beyond that each one has four aspects or weaponaltering forms but youll only have access to three for each at the startthis article was originally published on were rerunning today following the games recent release on playstation and xboxfor all intents and purposes these individual aspects function as different weapons a particular bow aspect might automatically target an enemy for instance a version of the fists might magnetically pull foes toward you its not exactly gamechanging stuff but it certainly helps shake your runs up you can unlock these extra aspects in skellys chamber right before you start each run by forking over some hardearned titans blood but you might notice that the fourth and final one is shrouded for each given the arcane nature of how hades works you wouldnt be wrong to wonder how in the hades do i get that last aspectminor spoilers for hades followthe simple answer as with many things hades is that itll happen in due time like the river lethe hades pushes forward unceasingly but there are ways to speed up the processchiefly by learning secret phrases from various denizens of the underworld and then repeating them to your semisentient weapons dont worry zagreus will do the memorizing and the speaking for youplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingfirst you need to purchase the fated list of minor prophecies from the house contractor if you havent already done so seriously whats stopping you its cheap gemstones and also opens up an expansive list of optional objectives all of which will in turn line your coffers with even more currency theres also a good chance youll need to beat the game at least once i didnt uncover a single hidden aspect until after i completed my first run same for everyone ive spoken to about the game but some folks on social media suggest that you need only reach the final boss not beat itread more everything you need to know to beat hades for the first timefrom there youll need to have unlocked five extra aspects across the six weapons in your armory sorry the standard aspect of zagreus that comes with each weapon doesnt count once thats squared just talk to achilles over and over and over again until eventually he gives you the secret phrase for varatha the eternal spear interact with the spear before your next run and youll reveal the aspect of guan yu of note you neednt unlock it before revealing the other five aspects you just need to reveal itto reveal the final five aspects youll first need to invest five titans blood into the weapon you want to uncover an aspect for whether that means leveling up the aspect of zagreus a bit or unlocking and leveling up the other two aspects available then youre more or less at the whims of the gods of random number generation you just need to repeatedly talk to the following people during your runs until the hidden phrase comes up in conversationfor artemis and zeus you can equip their keepsakesthe adamant arrowhead and thunder signet respectivelyat the start of each run to ensure you run into them early on nyx is a constant presence in the house of hades so you can talk to her whenever you want but chaos meanwhile is a fickle little primordial omniscient monster chaos does what chaos wants cant help you thereasterius is a bit trickier than those four as youre making your way through elysium keep an eye out for chamber rewards that have a skull on the bottom of the bubble those indicate a tougher battle and theres a chance you can face the bull of minos in oneonone combat as a bonus defeating him will slash his health significantly for elysiums final boss battle i took him on with the twin fists of malphon and he made some foreshadowing comment about destiny or fate or whatever the next time i fought him sans fists he gave me the phrasethis might all sound like a slog worthy of a certain boulderpusher but if youre a fan of the game its well worth the effort to see it through whether or not these hidden aspects are good is a matter of opinion and playstyle whats certain is that unlike the three initial aspects theyre significantly gamechanging the swords aspect of arthur for instance can create an area that slows down any enemy that enters it the aspect of lucifer turns exagryph into a laser gun that can fire motionsensing damageradiating explosives these variations force you to approach runs creatively from both strategic okay what boons are now best with this weapon and tactical okay how should i use this new move against the hydra perspectivestheres also a narrative impetus to unlock this stuff arthur beowulf gilgameshyou may have noted that each aspect is tied to a legend unaffiliated with greek mythology characters will remark on this no ones heard of this lucifer fellow but apparently he had a fight with his dad whatever the case everyones sure that he alongside all of those other unknown legends is a tough customer worthy of wielding one of the infernal armsits another neat plot device in a game already chockfull of them play hades all you want for the really really good action but for me the narrative is the main draw and the best storiesfrom eurydice and orpheus to achilles and redactedin hades are those in the margins you wont experience all of them without unlocking these final aspects that alone is worth fighting your way out of hell however many times you need to,en,470.0,Positive

found solace in some levity in most and enjoyment in them all here are my top games of studios is the master of firstperson immersive sims and deathloop is a testament to that a thrilling psychological tale about choices time and consequences deathloop builds on the excellence of dishonored and cranks the volume up to its brutal its fast but its also a delight especially as you unlock

game that felt a little incomplete to me when it came out in but i was intrigued by what the studio was doing and deaths door is the next logical step an isometric dungeoncrawler in which you control a crow who reaps souls deaths door is one of those games that expertly blends feel and mood it understands and executes its goal without overstaying its welcome it also has a dope boss fight that illustrates its elegant game design its no wonder deaths door appears on most of kotakus endoftheyear listsa shonen anime through and through pocket traps dodgeball academia is probably the most fun ive had with a video game all year long its an absurd charming little rpg about otto a student who leaves his lameass school against his parents wishes to join the collegiate at dodgeball academia a university of sorts for aspiring dodgeball players what you get is a sportscentric dodgeballemup replete with various power balls like electricity and homing special moves and side missions to complete it all gives way to a story about identity finding your true self and trusting your friends very naruto or one piece shit if were being honest and i love itnot going to lie i wasnt expecting to enjoy ateams final fantasy vii the first soldier as much as i have been and thats primarily because of the platform its on i mean its a mobile game the primary input method is the touchscreen while you cant get super accurate in this battle royale shooter because of that the first soldier is still a good way to kill some time especially if you missed fortnite on ios and because its a final fantasy game you can expect the usual accoutermentssummons gil materia costumes to dress your soldier up as iconic series characters and different playstyles ranging from the swordwielding warrior to a shurikenusing ninja there are even chocobo you can customize so whats there not to likeim a big fan of mobas having spent a good three or four years playing titan forge games smite when it launched in timi studio groups arena of valor was also in my moba rotation before getting upstaged by the developers pokmon unite its become my main moba now on account of both ip and approachability but more than that what pokmon unite has done is helped me find joy in mobas again i can be very competitive i get frustrated when i lose because others arent pulling their weight but pokmon unites diverse characters and fun events push me to see beyond the competition to enjoy both the aesthetic and gameplay without focusing solely on the score its a nice reprieve from the highintensity mobas elicit even though pokmon unite can get pretty intensethis is basically anime the video game developed by bandai namco studios and tose scarlet nexus piqued my interest when it was revealed in may and blew me away when i finished it sometime after its june release its a slick actionrpg with dual protagonists whose narratives are intimately connected prompting you to play through the game twice to see the story from both of their perspectives its an evocative emotional and exhilarating journey with tight controls and even tighter powers its fun but what i love most are the moments between playable characters kasane randall and yuito sumeragi as they come to understand their connection to each other and the events that unfold over the games hours scarlet nexus is brilliant and though it looks like a tales game its more than thatno list of mine would be complete without skateboarding making an appearance though its been available via apple arcade since agens games and studios skate city grinned onto consoles and pc this year without much fanfare thats understandable as it is pretty lowkey but everyones missing out on what amounts to a lofi version of eas skate skate city much like skate asks you to use the thumbsticks to chain tricks grinds and spins together to complete challenges while racking up points the lowpoly aesthetic coupled with the chillhop music make for a whole vibe and its a perfect game to fill some time honestly i cant put it downneowiz games skul the hero slayer is a cute roguelite actionplatformer but truthfully dont let its cuteness fool you this is a hardass game you play the eponymous skul a little skeleton warrior who can swap his head for that of another head which then transforms his entire body and grants him different abilities theres a grim reaper mage ninja werewolf and so many more to pick up that playing through and getting whooped in skul the hero slayer always presents another opportunity to discover a new playstyle thats the best part no two runs are the same and even if there are similarities between the two either in the form of familiar pathways or enemies in familiar spots you can switch it up by simply swapping headsmuch like scarlet nexus bandai namco studios tales of arise is also anime the video game those familiar with the tales formula know what to expect in this actionrpg but everythings been cranked up to the visuals are absolutely stunning the realtime gameplay is tight as all hell the characters are fascinating and deep but what really strikes me is the games story which is this interweaving narrative about class and liberation it packs so much meat onto its bones that while some of it can feel a little dry most of what tales of arise offers is both enticing and delectable im still in the beginning but im stoked to see more of what alphen and his eclectic party members get intowho knew a game with absolutely no dialogue could be so heartbreaking and yet witch beams unpacking is just that a storydriven puzzle game that follows an unnamed protagonist as they go through lifes various stagesearly adolescence college life first relationships and their fallout etceteraunpacking says so much about finding ourselves in and out of love without saying a single thing its a beautiful experience one held up by excellent environmental sound and visual design it also reminds us how much boyfriends can suck especially when they dont make space for you it might be short but unpacking will stick with you for a long time afterwith that i say goodbye to and all its bullshit most of it

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/naruto-shippuden-anime-director-s-ocean-cut-filler-fan-1848765385,Loving Boyfriend Edits 115 Hours Of Anime Filler Out Of Naruto For Girlfriend,an anime youtuber boldly edited down the entirety of naruto filler arcs and all into an easier and more pleasant viewing experiencethe big three anime naruto bleach and one piece are inevitable watches for every shnenloving otaku however along with the clout of being the most popular series of the comes their shared burden of being daunting time sinks to watch this isnt helped by their seemingly endless filler arcs and glacial pacingafter youtuber oceaniz and his girlfriend laura ran out of anime to watch together he mustered up the courage to pop the big question no not that one would you watch naruto with me if i edited it to be less ass to watchnaruto was an immensely influential series for me oceaniz told kotaku i just like sharing stuff that is important to me with people that are important to meplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingoceaniz told kotaku this isnt the first time hed broached the idea of watching naruto with her but the prospect of watching all episodes and enduring its overutilization of flashbacks and aggressive filler episodes made the shonen anime a very tough sell however as they watched more anime togethermy hero academia attack on titan and jojos bizarre adventure among othersoceaniz said watching naruto became much more feasiblethats when i decided it was now or never to finally make that customized naruto cut i had wanted for years oceaniz told kotaku and doing it for a loved one was a great excuseenjoying the other anime proved to be enough of a toedip into the medium for laura to humor him on his proposal after a sheepish sure babe from laura oceaniz booted up adobe premiere and got to work making naruto the ocean cutmaking the ocean cut took around three months with many long evenings of me tinkering on it oceaniz told kotaku i started in january and finished around midmarchyesterday oceaniz uploaded a youtube video titled i reedited all of naruto for my girlfriend in which he detailed his journey condensing naruto and tailoring it specifically to his likingthe first rule of the ocean cut is that it is the english dub version of narutosorry not sorry oceaniz said in the video this is a dubwatching household and its my preferred version so i was always going to do it like thisfan edits arent new to naruto in fact other cuts like naruto kai aimed to remove all the filler episodes from the series oceaniz however didnt feel that fan edit would make for the best introduction because he found it overly draconic in how strictly it stuck to mangacentric content thus robbing the series of its best animeoriginal momentsonce he got rolling oceaniz would typically take three to six tv episodes that ran roughly minutes each and condense them into to ocean cut episodes his youtube video goes into great detail about his thought process for cutting content like narutos diarrhea incident all of the sexy jutsu nonsense and jiraiyas superdidntagewell pervy sage introduction he even went the extra mile in translating japanese signs and the like into english much like how crunchyroll handles its onscreen translationshaving grown up with naruto oceaniz was well aware that he had a massive undertaking ahead of him the biggest lifts would come from narutos notoriously drawnout filler episodes which occasionally spiraled out into entire arcs and the shows numerous flashback sequences which would often retread scenes that transpired just seconds priorthe flashbacks in particular are so bad that certain scenes are shown up tono different times with only a fraction of them showing any new information oceaniz said in the videonot all filler episodes were removed from the ocean cut wellregarded filler episodes like gotta see gotta know kakashisenseis true face were allocated to a themed special episodes segment of the ocean cut but regrettably some might argue the infamous land of tea escort mission episodes didnt make the cuti cut that shit out so fast its so boring and badly animated oceaniz said in the video dont bother with itnaruto shippuden narutos timeskip arc proved to be an sranklevel undertaking for the burgeoning editor according to oceaniz shippuden is where naruto really went off the rails with its terrible pacing long stretches of infodumping and inmediasres story structure that would regularly spoil major plot pointsthat was easily the lowest part of the project oceaniz said on youtube once we actually got to watching the ocean cuts version of the tenchi bridge arc especially its tectonic pacing stood out so much that my girlfriend straightup asked me if we could skip ahead to the end of the arc and if i could just tell her what happenedoceaniz found filler content and pseudofiller content in shippuden trickier to cut out because in that show it has the tendency to bleed into canon beats while he admitted this made for an imperfect segment of the ocean cut oceanic tried to rearrange major arcs in shippuden so they would make more sequential sense not only in naruto proper but to allow for missing occasional references to filleradjacent occurrences left out of the new cut much like with naruto proper oceaniz made sure to keep emotionally resonant animeoriginal scenes in the ocean cut most notably the conversation between shikamaru and his father while they played shogi arguably the best emotional moment in the animethe shippuden anime doesnt end exactly like the manga does instead of naruto achieving his boyhood dream of becoming hokage ninja president at the end of the fourth shinobi world war the anime includesyou guessed iteven more filler content unlike the previous filler examples that dont add to the greater story of naruto shippudens later filler is quite wholesome and fills in the gaps between the war and naruto finally becoming hokage with content from narutos light novelsmost of that stuff is really good i of course added it in oceaniz said on youtube and of course the last is mandatory viewing in this house bite meultimately the ocean cut doesnt alter narutos story with the exception of oceaniz including an epilogue told via selfmade title cards in which orochimaru and kabuto face the consequences for their war crimes whereas in the anime and manga they got off scotfreein totality the canon naruto episodes clock in at hours of orange jumpsuit knuckleheaded ninja content while viewing the ocean cut would take only hours for more details including the answer to the inevitable question of can i watch this myself check out his youtube vidin the end did oceanizs hard work editing down the entirety of naruto make for a painless viewing experience for his girlfriend lauras verdict is a resounding yesit was surprisingly one of the best shows youve shown me so far she told himseeing how swimmingly naruto the ocean cut went over for his partner i couldnt help but ask him if there were any potential plans for an ocean cut treatment for boruto the spinoff series starring narutos son oceaniz didnt take kindly to the questionboruto ocean cut is not happening he wrote because a i dont particularly like boruto and b since the difference between the boruto anime and boruto manga are so big bigger than narutos were it would be an enormous task for a series i dont know nearly as well as narutohad to give it a try,en,554.0,Positive

the movies first excited my imagination ive spent far too much money on this franchise buying up games books comics and lego sets so understand that what im about to say comes from a place of pure love and care star wars is really silly and dumb and because of this its always nice when lucasfilm and disney let creative partners have fun with the franchisethats exactly what the wonderful lego star wars games have done in the past and to great success lego star wars the skywalker saga the newest game in the series continues this tradition of having fun with all the space wizards and talking puppets but does so now at a previously unseen scale the end result one of the best star wars games ever madelego star wars the skywalker saga a game that is somehow bigger than even its own clunky title was created by the folks over at tt games before i go any further into how much i liked it i want to mention that id have been happy waiting another six months or more for this game even after all the delays if it could have saved the devs from crunchingas reported by polygon earlier this year this latest lego game was created by a team that allegedly had to put up with unhealthy stresscausing workloads and whose concerns often got ignored by management its easy to look at a game this cute and silly and just assume it was made in a happy musicfilled candy factory all the workers laughing as they oneup each other creating the series trademark jokes but thats just not the reality and while i dont think folks should be punished for enjoying this game i also appreciate and respect people who decide to not play it its a shitty situation and one which tt games needs to avoid in the future for the sake of its own devsif you do decide to play skywalker saga youll discover that this is a giant game it covers all nine movies from phantom menace to rise of skywalker each episode includes five levels and a bunch of openworldlike action between each bigger setpiece with most episodes taking about two to three hours to complete assuming you dont get distracted by all the collectibles and hidden puzzlesas you complete levels and progress through the story you unlock more locations to visit in the games galaxyspanning free mode here you can bring an assortment of star wars characters with you and unlock previously unreachable areas using characters unlocked during the story missions with over characters and planets to discover i can easily see myself spending a few dozen hours combing through each gorgeous massive environment solving every puzzle and collecting all the hidden characterupgrading kyber bricksyou are never too old to enjoy some legos or pretend to be a jediopenworld familyfriendly actionadventure romp with light rpg elementswonderful humor how much star wars is packed in here impressive visuals modernsome minor bugs a few missing characters allegedly made under crunchtt xbox series xs played xbox one switch pcapril hoursunlike the past lego star wars games skywalker saga uses a behindtheback camera angle along with improved more modernfeeling combat and movement controls shooting feels like it was ripped right out of fortnite using an overtheshoulder aiming setup melee combat is also improved using a simple but fun combo system that features different attacks and the ability to block and counter that said you can still buttonmash through encounters which is nice considering how many younger kids will probably just do that instead of learning all the various combosskywalker saga is easily the bestlooking lego game ever made you now have full control of the camera letting you truly admire the incredible amount of graphical detail on display the worlds you visit effortlessly blend photorealistic cliffs and deserts with digital lego bricks almost as if you are a kid playing with legos in your backyard or sandbox as you explore deserts or swamps your lego characters will actually start to get dirty and even acquire scratches look closely enough and you can even make out the lego logo stamped onto their bodies and other brickbuilt ships and propsat one point i actually grabbed a lego star wars ship from my embarrassingly large collection to compare it to its digital counterpart i was shocked by how accurate it was even bits that didnt matter ingame like a small technic piece used to pop a droid out of its seat easily were included in the digital shipbut as i mentioned the real star of lego star wars is how deftly the game weaves in humor for example during the episode ii campaign you get captured and dragged into a large arena filled with nasty monsters one of them looks like a cat so the aliens who are holding you captive use a laser pointer to get its attention and make it attack you i laughed a lot and not just at that jokethis type of humor is found throughout and even if you dont care about the franchise i suspect the jokes and gags will keep you entertained throughout and if like me you love star wars the injoke references to the films and past lego games are a lot of fun tooi cant think of another star wars game thats included so much of the franchise in such a brilliant and wellmade package and does it all without becoming boring or bogged down in canon details and retcons star wars is silly star wars is epic lego star wars the skywalker saga knows this and embraces both aspects while being a lot of fun and very funny its one of my favorite games of and while some hardcore star wars fans may be loathe to admit it yes this is probably the best star wars game yet made,en,476.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-brotherhood-of-venice-the-kotaku-revi-1847405708,Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood Of Venice: The Kotaku Review,one of my favourite board games of all time is vcommandos a coop world war two game thats all about stealth and covert warfare now years later the team behind that game have taken everything theyve learned from and put it to work on something from around instead assassins creed brotherhood of venicethis isnt the first assassins creed board game but its easily the biggest something ill get into in more detail later on in this review but for now know that this is a pretty promising fit not only do creators triton noir have pedigree with games about sneaking around but the design team have exubisoft developers in their ranks one of whom worked directly on the fiction of the assassins creed universeafter a long waitthe games kickstarter ran all the way back in of venice is finally here and its not your average board game adaptation like ive said the designers have assassins creed experience while ubisofts current assassins creed writing team have also helped out on some of the content that ties into the games existing canon in all kinds of interesting ways making this more of a continuation of the lore than a mere adaptation of stuff weve already played through with eziobrotherhood of venice comes in an enormous box thats full of cards stage tiles and a whole army of miniatures the game is built around a long narrativedriven campaign that has players opening envelopes to discover mission objectives building maps out of modular tiles then playing cooperatively to sneak pastkill guards and accomplish objectives each mission you play runs for around an hour and in between them you get to retreat to a headquartersrepresented physically as its own map tile with places to store itemswhere you can rest and resupply its a lot of administrative work but it also helps maintain an air of secrecy as far as the campaigns missions and items gogameplay is very similar to vcommandos in that players get to go first taking turns to move and complete actions you do this in a way thats essential for teamworkand its one of the most satisfying parts of the game when you can work together to pull stuff offby spacing out those actions so say if i have four actions this turn i can take two of them to get into the same room as a guard then a friend can jump into the room and kill that guard then i can spend my last two points hiding the body and legging it out of the room again teamwork you dont have to do this but when youre playing with friends its definitely the coolest and most satisfying way to get the job doneonce all the assassins have moved its the enemys turn your opponents are controlled by a very basic ai system where that turns event card has a compass direction printed on it and every guard that can move many are stuck in place by various jobsconditions will go that way unless players have been spotted in which case guards will head towards them insteadkey to this whole idea of detection and movement is an alarm state that is triggered when youre spotted which not only attracts guards but also affects the reinforcements step that takes place at the end of every turn if the alarm is silent then youll get fewer bad guys to deal with but if its tripped you will have to face a lot more ideally you dont want to trip the alarm ever but its also largely impossible to manage that for an entire mission since whether youre spotted or not is largely determined by dice rolls you have to assume that eventually things will go to hell and youll have to improvise which is often when your teamwork and coordination are the most enjoyablei liked this system in vcommandosits a lot more elegant than it sounds especially since you can see which direction the enemy will move during your turn letting you account for itbut its even better here maybe because it feels more appropriate the mix of stealth and open combat the emphasis on hiding bodies the need to pick out spots to leap out from the shadows the constant risk of an alarm being raised it all feels exactly like playing assassins creed only now youve got wingmen and everythings moving a lot slower as tabletop adaptations of video games go this is one of the greatsespecially if youre a big assassins creed nerd in addition to playing like an assassins creed gamebrotherhood of venice feels like one dropping almost instantly into the series labyrinthine lore with a story that continues through each mission there are plenty of characters fans will know including ezio himself and the way the story develops along with your characters levelling up and gaining new abilities and items really helps tie together what could have been a disparate and disjointed set of missionsthe thing is in trying so hard to play just like the video games on the tabletop brotherhood of venice has managed to let some of the franchises bloat and tedium creep in where this medium could and should have actually kept things leaner basically i found this game too big its too big literally coming in a comically large box and when unfurled taking up an enormous amount of space on the table with assassin player mats a game map or two multiple decks of cards some other big mats for enemies and a compass a huge hq tile with its own cards stacks of envelopes containing the games missionsits an enormous task setting this game up and an even bigger one packing it away and keeping things organised so you can play it againive got a pretty big dining table but as you can see below that didnt matter to brotherhood of venice which just keeps on getting bigger and bigger and bigger and the photo below is from a night when just two of us were playingbut its also too big in its scope there are over missions to play through as part of the campaignloads more if youve got the three expansionsand each one lasts for roughly an hour or even longer if youre playing with a full complement of four assassins and you have to wait for everyone to strategize and take their turn do the math on that then work in how difficult it can be getting people together in the same room throw in the administrative burden of keeping all the cards and events and items uptodate as part of an ongoing campaign which can take forever and youll see how big an investment it is committing yourself to brotherhood of veniceif that sounds like something you and your friends could handle then great maybe youll be away for a weekendweek and can just power on through it maybe youve got a games room or dedicated space where you can leave it set up and not have to worry about rebuilding the whole thing every time then packing it away maybe youre just an assassins creed obsessive who doesnt really have much going on for the next few months and think everything ive just said is fine and acceptable to you in your current circumstancesanyone ticking those boxes is in a good place to adore this game and in most ways i do too but even then even though i wanted to i just couldnt get to the end i have a video game website to work for i play football i have two kids theres a pandemic going on and maybe most importantly in this context i have board gaming friends who like to play other board games not the same one for months and months on end i get that this is my personal circumstance but its my review and i think the scope of this game combined with the hassle of keeping everything filed and sorted correctly midcampaign makes this worth keeping in mindwhich is a damn shame because as far as the game itself goes i loved it i love how smart and snappy it plays and how elegant the enemy system works and because i havent mentioned it yet i also really liked the way this game is just a pleasure to be around its easy to make fun of the amount of plastic miniatures used in licensed board games these days but brotherhood of venice uses its guards ladders chests and spoilers to great effect nearly everything you do in this game is represented by a token or miniature which gives the game a great sense of physicality while the map tiles and card art are rich and vibrant and slot in seamlessly alongside what youd be accustomed to from the video game seriessadly it was just a bit too much for me which is pretty funny when you think about it considering being great but asking too much of its players is the exact same problem i think the video games are suffering from at the moment at least here that equation is variable depending on your individual situation so like ive said if you can get a campaign rolling and keep it going this is a fantastic albeit slower version of the assassins creed experienceif you want to see in detail how the game works this dice tower video is a good place to start,en,583.0,Positive

rare game that sneaks up on you the kind of game you dont even see coming yet turns out to be incredible a pointandclick adventure game first released back in february i hadnt heard of it until last month when folks i follow in games media started more and more loudly singing its praises now having played it myself i understand why its an extraordinarily affecting journey one i cant recommend strongly enough i walked away from writer and artist meredith grans debut game feeling a wave of contradicting yet intertwining emotions frustration and joy longing and warmth hope and regret anger and love this nostalgic comingofage story about a teenage girl in the early and the ephemerality of adolescence fucked me up it took me back to my own childhood nicking old wounds and poking burnt coals with such specificity i couldnt tell if i was playing a game or reliving parts of my life either way i loved every bit of itdeveloped by the creator of octopus pie a comic series about two women living in new york that ran from perfect tides has a similar kinda vibe the story follows mara whitefish an almost her birthdays in a couple of months ok leave her alone jewish girl living on the remote island of perfect tides city kids dream of running away to this idyllic archipelago while residents especially children cant stand being on it why because there aint shit to doas mara puts it there are no cars no department stores no asphalt or steel no nothing its the kind of place where rich folks have summer homes and where queer people can probably feel safe but also a bit suffocated by the deeply conservative culture of selfexpression on the island and its easy to feel trapped in this picturesque but limiting landscape hell the only way to get off the islet is by ferry boat which is also maras only way to high school perfect tides is far from perfect and no one wants to leave the boring and empty island more than mara and her one reallife friend lily it doesnt happenmara is still only in high school after allbut teenagers can dream and mara dreams a lot about her future overanalyzing her own every action in the hopes that they build into something romantically epicthis all shakes out in the form of a pointandclick adventure game similar to oldschool lucasarts or sierra entertainment classics like day of the tentacle and kings quest vi perfect tides will have you incessantly clicking around the screen with the prayer of finding out what to do and where to go next to be clear the puzzlesolving rarely presents any real roadblocks many of them are optional and whether you complete them or not doesnt prevent you from progressing but rather affects the games ending i find this fascinating the multiple endings and the actions you take to trigger them personalize maras journey based on your moral compass reflecting your ideals back to you however as cool as that is i was bummed to reach the end only to discover after the fact that id missed some of these optional puzzlesand as a result a few tender moments between characters i couldve experienced had i known and done themplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingfor example theres this one part around the summertime where if you happen to combine two different items they create something else that can be traded for a gift to be given to maras asshole of a brother during hanukkah in the winter altering the dialogue you get and the resulting ending optional actions like this are brilliant because they can illustrate both maras growth and our capacity to forgive others so my issue isnt that i didnt know the solution to this specific puzzle but rather that i didnt even know it was a puzzle an option to do or not do something and that completing certain puzzles can change the games ending i dont want games like this to spell out their puzzles solutions but perfect tides doesnt always adequately clue you in to what might be possible or how it will affect the world and its characters this does add some semblance of replayability thoughwhatever modest frustrations perfect tides puzzles may cause the narrative more than makes up for them it tells a complicated story about being a teen in the early with all the digital and real heartbreak that comes with adolescence in the internet age as well as all the melodramatic angst and intensity that being a teen can color the world with as the games four seasons pass mara transforms from an anxious fanfic writer and forum lurker intowhatever you make her as you play through this formative year in her life she can become more confident defining her ideals as she learns that people are fallible and occasionally let us down conversely she can retreat into herself as her relationships fizzle out mara is her own character as much as she is a conduit through which you can relive that era and as such it can resurface both comforting and painful memories if you happened to come of age in that era yourself which i didno i was not a jewish girl living on an island in the year and yet meredith gran imbues her characters with such emotional depth and nuance that i saw my own upbringing mirrored in so much of perfect tides waiting for the computer to connect to the internet feeling your ears bleed as the aol dialup noise screeched from the speakers befriendingand eventually datingan internet stranger watching friends slowly drift away contemplating the temptation of a quiet death with each ingame revelation each season coming to a close i couldnt help but wonder if meredith and i were the same or if the millennial experience was just that universaltheres something about the way meredith gran wrote mara the shackling insecurity that bars the teenager from normal social interactions that not only clued me into maras own erratic mental state but also reflected my own adolescent struggles back at me as if gran had some crystal ball peering into my life her depiction of teenage angst is on point and the push and pull between maras desires for intimacy and her inner critics overprotective nature is both frustrating and understandable its remarkable just how authentic these characters feel how they make mistakes sometimes even knowing how dumb those mistakes are even if you didnt grow up in the early the complexity compassion and humanity with which gran captures adolescence transcends its period setting capturing something real and true about the excitement and anguish of growing upas the credits rolled i felt a lot of regret for my mara who despite my best intentions made some of the same mistakes i did as a teenager many of which may have been avoidable if it werent for the desperate yearning for approval still theres hope for mara as a freshfaced shes got her whole life ahead of her one full of trials and tribulations but one worth living all the samethats probably the single most salient note to take away from perfect tides conclusion as long as there is breath in your lungs you can always start fresh mara might not leave perfect tides and many of her friends on the island may not remain so for long but theres comfort in knowing you can reinvent yourself every day its a lesson mara grows to accept regardless of the ending you wind up with and its a beautiful one we could all learn fromperfect tides is out now on itchio and steam,en,606.0,Positive

game even has a fun expanded universeinspired singleplayer campaign starring the clone troopersboba fett may be the more famous bounty hunter but the clones dad jango is pretty cool too and bounty

was ported to and cleaned up a bit though be prepared for some camera control and gunplayplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingits a little unfair to say this is just doom star wars but also thats a great pitch for a game and it turns out that dark forces is pretty damn good some have even called it the best star wars game ever i wouldnt go that far but it perfectly captures the look and feeling of the original films in an exciting classic fps that still holds up in unleashed is a silly overthetop at times straightup bonkers thirdperson action game starring darth vaders apprentice starkiller even back before disney removed most of the eu from canon this game always felt too absurd even for star wars but dont let the absurdity and wild action scare you away no all of that is why unleashed is on this list

lego star wars the skywalker saga is a wonderful game filled with worlds and missions based on all mainline films but the classic complete saga which ironically isnt complete anymore is still worth checking out for its own lowerbudget charm and silliness while i prefer the new game over the old one theres no denying that complete sagawith its older chunkier lego piecesis a very nostalgic game that mostly holds up thanks to simple but fun gameplay and controlswhile its not the first star wars racing game ever made its easily the best building upon the podracing action found in the original pod racer on racer revengefirst released on improves just about everything adding more tracks and racers while also greatly improving the visuals and controls even in it still looks and plays wella

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/company-of-heroes-the-kotaku-review-1848020824,,ive reviewed a lot of video game adaptations as part of my board game coverage for kotaku as youd expect since this is first and foremost a video game website some of those adaptations have been ok some have been pretty good but i havent played any quite like company of heroes beforesome of those decent adaptations like doom or fallout tried to replicate some of the themes and basic gameplay hooks of their digital counterparts while still clearly being their own distinct tabletop experiences you could play those games and think yeah this ends up getting to the same general spot as the video game does and i liked that video game so i like this toocompany of heroes the video game is one of the greatest pc strategy games ever made if youre reading this and arent familiar with it i wrote about a few years back in the most glowing terms possiblebetter adaptations like the assassins creed game i only just reviewed manage to go a bit further theyre able to transplant whole systems from the video game to the tabletop giving the board game the same overall vibes as the video game you dont like the board game just because you liked assassins creed but because you liked assassins creeds particular take on stealth and evasion which brotherhood of venice was able to so excellently replicatecompany of heroes somehow manages to go even further still this practically is the video game all of it every system every aspect everything you remember and love about the video game youll find it here only now youre playing it on a table instead of a pc it doesnt even matter that its now turnbased while the video game was realtime you get the exact same feelings only at a slightly slower paceits so close i dont even know if this counts as an adaptation anymore its almost a port though i say that with the utmost admiration for the designers at bad crow studios while the board game manages to stuff everything from relics release in here the ways theyve crammed it in are of course unique to the tabletop and so worthy of praisecompany of heroes ships with a few different ways to play ranging from standard skirmishes taking and holding victory points to hq assaults and with the coop expansion throws in the ability to add very smartlyhandled ai opponents and teammates to the mix theres no campaign but there are a few big maps you can mess around with which can be scaled and changed and even combined if youve got the space to provide different challengesthere are four factions players can choose from germany the ussr the usa and britain theyre all fairly interchangeable at least in terms of the quantity and mix of units and so arent locked to any particular side in the war you can pit the british against the americans or have the soviets team up with germany through the use of special powers and upgradeable hqs though each side largely follows the same basic themes as in the video game with the british geared towards the construction of emplacements while the americans are more focused on infantry gimmickslike ive said the brilliance here isnt in any kind of pioneering and innovative board game design since practically every system here is based on one already invented by relic back in but the team at bad crow deserve immense credit for the way theyve understood these mechanics and then found ways to adapt them to the tabletop a skill that cant be appreciated enough when it comes to these kind of games after all if it was so easy to turn a video game into a board game i wouldnt be getting so excited about the job this one has donejust because this feels like company of heroes at every turn doesnt mean it simply copies from the video game that would be crazy since the video game was realtime instead it takes every feeling you have from using every system on the pc and all the satisfaction you get from pulling off a sweeping tactical triumph and fills in the gaps elegantly giving us the same options and choices from upgrade paths to flanking opportunities but handing the execution of those off to dice and hexescover is here buildings that can be used to protect infantry but collapse under fire are also here as is suppression and the video games perfect rockpaperscissors balance between units and the way control points are captured and the way every battle starts with weaker squads then has to ramp up to bigger guns and tanksyou can plan and play a skirmish in this board game exactly the same way you would on the pc indeed the only area youd say theres a marked departure is combat since that could never be handled in realtime the same way but even here the board game does its best to make it feel realtime anywayat the point in every turn when its time to start shooting every unit thats in range of another gets to assign dice some of which will do automatic damage others which can be rolled with a chance of escaping the hits depending on the type of unit it is and the unit attacking it a simulation of the way the video game didnt let infantry attack a tank unless specially equipped for example it doesnt matter if its a battered infantry squad with one surviving rifleman or a tank fresh off the factory floor every units gets to trade blows and no unit can ever be wiped out without getting a chance to get a shot off of its own so while combat is resolved by players taking turns rolling dice the way its resolved still plays out as though those bullets and shells were exchanged in realtimecompany of heroes is a wonderfully tactile experience even at its smallest scale its still got thick huge boards to play on and the plastic miniatures you litter the battlefield with look fantastic from the smallest infantry squads through to the biggest tanks which can be painted and come with decals to apply if youre into modelling at all things get even better with the optional terrain pack which adds plastic buildings you can place infantry inon little plastic sandbags for cover and actual flagpoles with little flags that you get to swap every time a point changes handsbetween all the units and the board and the mountains of dice and tokens it has all the sensory appeal of a serious wargame with almost none of the hassle since company of heroes is definitely on the memoir side of the complexity scale the fun here is had in the broad brushstrokes of tactical engagement not its minutiae i know that looks like a lot of dice in these photos but here you have to imagine each one as an explosion rather than a set of complicated rulescompany of heroes is a game where youre always moving and seemingly always shooting where frontlines constantly bend but rarely break its a game where the whole war just gently ebbs and flows your plans always one step away from fruition but so too your opponents its such a delicious balance which the video game nailed and the board game getting it right as well goes a long way towards making it as enjoyable as it is to playbad crow studios deserve immense credit for what theyve accomplished here theyve neither invented or even reinvented the wheel but what theyve done is almost like a work of translation taking the design language of a successful video game and bringing the same joyif not through quite the same methodsto the tabletop i once said company of heroes was the perfect rts and i still mean it but company of heroes is now also a nearperfect tabletop game as well,en,756.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/the-best-dreamcast-games-1835926847,The Best Dreamcast Games,heres a terrifying fact sega has been out of the console business longer than they were in it and while it was the dreamcast that finally did the struggling giant in for a platform that was only around for a couple of years it certainly left one hell of a legacy behindyoud think a console that failed in would have been long forgotten by but many of the dreamcasts biggest and best games are still making their mark on video games today from soulcalibur to shenmuealso worth remembering it had the single greatest console startup routine of all time like molten gold dripping under pale moonlight into a fine marble basinin honour of segas fallen hero weve put together this list of the best games for the dreamcast for those who might be interested in circling around and picking one up or those who once did and would like a tragic trip down memory lanethis unranked list has been made based on a couple of core considerations firstly and most obviously most of these are the games we simply think are the best dreamcast games those that are our personal favourites but there are also games here after two decades of space and time to consider that we think defined the dreamcast experiencei know i said this list was unranked but i lied jet set radio was the best dreamcast game i know it had its flaws regarding difficulty and the time limits some of which were addressed in the later xbox port but the colours the music the stylethis is the millennium distilled the perfect standard bearer for everything beautiful and good about the sega dreamcast if you could only ever own one game for this system it shouldwould be thisnobody knew it at the time but was one of the most important sports video games ever made back when the dreamcast launched ea sports decided they didnt want to release games for the system which meant no madden no problem sega figured so they went out and bought developer visual concepts who not only went on to seriously challenge madden in the football space through the but are now killing ea in basketball with their series was their second football effort on the console and wasnt just a better sports game than the first but it also had online multiplayer something that wouldnt catch on with rival platforms for yearsoriginally an arcade game ikarugas first ever home port was on the dreamcast where it was released only in japan that didnt stop westerners from importing it in droves and what theyd find was one of the smartest and prettiest shmups ever made the colourflipping mechanic at the heart of the game is such a simple idea but even two decades later its just still so perfectan expensive and beloved project way ahead of its time that bombed commercially leaving a flaming wreck and a beautiful legacy in its wake we could be talking about the dreamcast itself or we could be talking just about shenmueits heavy emphasis on story and revolutionary if also frustratingly basic way of implementing it in a video game earned it a ton of praise at release but also a ton of indifference from a market that just wasnt ready or lets be honest just didnt care for its quirksthere had never been and has never been another fighting game series quite like power stone where most other fighters are comfortable existing in abstract spaces the power stone games tried to replicate a proper space for their arenas including differing heights and destructible objects both were a blast but power stone was the better game also that old capcom character design is just to die forlike jet set and space channel and many other dreamcast games rez is a game that youve probably played somewhere else but whats important is that it was originally developed with segas console in mind it was and remains a nearperfect synaesthetic experience especially if played with its nutso vibrator peripheralthe trance vibrator came out on january packaged with special versions of rez for the jet set radio was most millennial video game space channel might run a very close second its mere existence is testament to how weird and daring the dreamcasts library could be where a company could actually take a janetmichael jackson music video and turn it into a rhythm game then expect more than three people to buy itseaman a piece of software that involved talking into a microphone at a fish with a human face that of yoot saito the games creator has not aged particularly well but just picture the process involved in getting this from high

through pipes if you play your cards right a single character can take a tour around the entire map in one go causing havoc everywhere the game is also a giant love letter to all things mario which is why the rabbids based on the popular nintendo characters work so welltheyre parodying something that ubisoft understands deeply by the end of the game you might even find yourself kicking out the

any doubt that nintendos pink puffball can more than carry his own adventure gamedespite its semiopenworld setting the game doesnt get swallowed by the vastness of its new format for clarity forgotten land is not technically an openworld game as its areas are segmentedbut for the sake of brevity we will describe it as such forgotten land is intuitive without holding your hand allows you to explore the gameplay the way you want and is stuffed with a ton of formidable enemies and hidden environmental details in betweenone day while chilling in dream land a rift tears open in the sky and sucks up waddle dees in an attempt to rescue the waddle dees our hero kirby winds up getting isekaid into a dystopian world that resembles our ownimmediately forgotten land distances itself from prior kirby games with the injection of a perilous antiutopia while previous titles amounted to breezy kirby visual novels forgotten land is a greek epic chocked full of imposing titans kirby must conquer and gone are the ontherails tours through picturesque sidescrolling landscapes where you overcome enemies with the power of friendship and kirbys bottomless lung capacity now you must boldly march into the unknown armed as the throat goat while investing time and resources into upgrading powers of your choosing this dark change of pace made forgotten land an invigorating adventure from start to finish without becoming overlymelancholythe game begins with a rapture sure but kirbys baby coos when discovering new landscapes and triumphant dances after completing a level make the forgotten land feel more like the more upbeat kirby games of the past that is until you begin exploring other areas that become increasingly darkareas that were once idyllic paradises transform into hellscapes each brave pitterpatter from kirbys tiny feet plunges him deeper into forgotten lands progressively harsh climates barren landscapes and warmongering wildlifethe doomandgloom lurking around every corner of forgotten land is neatly underscored by the games foreboding soundtrack whether it be an abandoned carnival a desert vista or a foggy silent hill stretch across a snowy bridge kirbys soundtrack accentuates each land with its own unique vibe forgotten lands music effectively foreshadows the looming threat hidden in each environment while being pretty damn catchy to bootforgotten land makes it clear that the entire game is just one extended rescue mission yet it manages to keep gameplay fresh by pacing out challenges and giving maps their own mechanics forgotten land lets you pick and choose what gameplay you want to explore most there are treasure hunt time trials for platforming fans collaborative play for those who dont want to go it alone and of course the optional openworld objectives that will make a completionists heart singall of these elements can help in your mission whether thats in the form of upgrades a helping hand in fights or acquiring new loot but forgotten land never forces you to delve into these playstyles leaving you to make the game your ownthe game entices you to at least try exploring the different objectives though with a smart use of cues at the start of levels players are prompted with messages like there are five objectives you can complete which encouraged me to scour every crack in the wall or mysteriouslykirbyshaped anomaly for a hidden pathway or mysterious itemwhile kirby games arent known for their difficulty forgotten land adds a sense of nuance to traversal and combat after completing an area the game reveals objectives that you missed like finding a secret pathway or defeating a boss with a specific power without being hit or floating off the ground though you can mainline the game by blitzing through areas like skipping through a board game the games optional objectives transform into a checklist that encourages more thorough exploration of the games world and mastery of kirbys abilities but the game more heavyhandedly encourages this growth through its treasure hunt side queststhough i initially dreaded treasure hunts for dropping me into an obstacle course devoid of the games many inventive worlds they quickly became my favorite aspect of forgotten land for the challenge they presented when my brainrotten devil may cryesque swordsmanship made the first couple of worlds a cakewalk to get through it also didnt hurt that grinding through them allowed me to quickly level up my goto kirby powersnobody puts baby in a cornergrand scale of its progressively inventive levels the imaginative utilization of mouthful mode and the game balance of wholesome fun and harrowing adventurehal laboratorymarch openworld adventure gamefinnicky platformingnintendo hours many of which were spent perfecting treasure huntsthat being said forgotten land isnt without its issuesthe platforming can be finicky while a running start before jumping would usually give you more distance kirby interprets that input as you walking forward with no intention of jumping leading kirby to take the plunge into the unforgiving depths platforming johns aside you can rest assured that each stumble and stride during the trials and tribulations of kirby are generously rewarded in forgotten lands bombastic finaleand while forgotten land is rich with hazardous landscapes and foreboding music it is bereft of compelling new characters kirbys newest companion elfilin never becomes more than a cheerleader and guide and meta knights appearance is a cheap cameo in a coinfarming tournamentking dedede however is an absolute standout prior to forgotten land he was portrayed merely as a lazy unjust king but forgotten land breaks the mold by giving the old curmudgeon a chance for redemption in a stunning go ahead ill hold them back scene that could have been pulled straight from an action film subtle moments like dededes chivalry or kirbys many bugeyed surprised faces provide shorthand characterization and provide muchneeded levity in between kirbys treacherous globetrotting and hes essentially the last vestige of humanity before bonkers space shit happensfinally forgotten lands final act is ballstothewalls highoctane action alongside some thirdact smrgsbord of elements that evoked thoughts of akira bayonetta and even halo while any other games attempt at such an overblown twist might buckle under the weight of its own ambition forgotten lands finale never did because kirby is already an eldritch horror himself everything within forgotten lands batshit crazy ending felt like a slow boil of concepts the game dripfed you until finally blowing its lid in spectacular fashion showcasing every gameplay mechanic at its maximum potential within the final actfrom its rapture beginnings to its m night shyamalanlike twist ending kirby and the forgotten land is a shining example that kirby warrants his lions share of openworld treatment alongside other nintendo properties like legend of zelda and marioupdate am et this review has been updated to clarify that kirby and the forgotten land is not technically an openworld game though it is colloquially referred to as such here and

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/wordle-today-games-like-alternatives-best-nerdle-heardl-1848782927,14 Games Like Wordle That Will Keep The Serotonin Flowing,wordle has brought us a lot of wonderfle things not least a surge of freely available oneaday puzzles to enjoy without the faff of having to install apps or register accounts played in a browser whether on your phone or laptop wordle and the many many games its inspired have become a part of peoples daily routines weve compiled a collection of the best of the rest the wordle clones and spinoffs that will improve your commute and coffee breakwithin the list are all manner of different approaches to reinventing the theme there are those that simply have you solve two four eight or wordles at once and those that extend the idea to attempting to guess a country on the planet nerdle adds math while fibble adds lies and yet more have you chaining word puzzles togetherwe should start at the start of course you already know wordle because it became as unavoidable as breathing air or hearing about a slap at the oscars theres a fiveletter word to guess and six guesses to find it get a right letter and it highlights yellow get a right letter in the right place and it turns green with this data you can find that wordthis is the pattern on which the majority of these similar games are based with mastermindlike hints to deduce a solution the best examples dont deviate too far from it instead finding a unique twist that adds intrigueread on to find a whole bunch of games that you should add to your daily routinepeople have developed a lot of trust with wordle its why theres such absolute uproar every time anything goes vaguely wrong whether its two different answers being served up to different people or the entire game being bought by a megacorp so what better than a variant of the game that deliberately lies to youfibble does just that giving you a starter word then eight further guesses to get the solution except in every result its lying about one of the lettersso if youve got a starter saying tribe with a yellow t and green i the rest gray any one of those pieces of information could be rubbish there might well be a b in the answer or the i might not be in the right place or even in the word at all you have to figure out a route through this based on guessing what its fibbing aboutobviously you can find your way to such information by repeating letters in given squares and seeing if there are contradictions for instance after tribe i tried stick and this time was told that the i was a yellow and the rest of the letters are grey which tells me one of two things either the first row was lying about there being a t at all or lying about the i being in the right place so therefore the second row is lying about one of the same two lettersas you go you can mark the tiles you suspect to be false in each answer to try to keep track of things but gosh yeah no this is not simple it is however rather brilliantthe easiest way to get more wordle into your life is to get more wordle into each puzzle starting with dordle a peculiar arms race began to produce workable wordle clones where you simultaneously solved more than one word at a timedordle does the obvious and has two puzzles sidebyside each letter guessed applies to both puzzles and accordingly youre given more guesses to get therein this case sevenquordle doubles things again with four simultaneous puzzles and eight guesses then octordle raises the stakes to eight words guessesof course it doesnt stop there next up is sedecordle with its words to find via attempts and yes theres duotrigordle sporting a ridiculous puzzles to solve at once and a daft triesas it happens this is a concept that peaks and then suddenly drops off octordles eight words is my favourite where theres still the element of danger of not getting there but once youre at it becomes a fairly simple process of elimination you plug in your four favorite starter words using different letters and after that you can work out most of the words just from the resulting clues odd as it seems the more puzzles you solve at once the easier it starts to getbut those first three are tabs well worth leaving open on your phones browserwhile we all delight in the knowledge that wordle was created by josh wardle as a gift to his girlfriend we can also deploy some aaawwwwwws toward nerdle created by a father and his teenage children richard mann was driving his daughter home from a hockey match and came up with the idea while stuck in trafficperhaps the best thing about mathbased nerdle is just how unlikely it seems that it should be possible and yet how very satisfying it is to successfully complete here instead of letters youre guessing numbers and mathematical symbols to correctly match that days piece of simple arithmeticthere are eight elements to the sum one of which will be an equals sign and the rest made of the numbers to and any of plus minus multiply and divide in six guesses it seems like it should be wholly impossible to deduce the matching combination and yet in months of playing ive never missedit turns out that with the wordlelike clues in this case purple for correct but in the wrong place green for correct and in the right place you can find a route to a sum in a very satisfying way more often than not i complete these in three or four turns and yet never with it feeling too easyi recommend having a starting sum like you might have a starting word for the letterbased variants mine is the game would never have a zero before a number like that in its actual solution but it gets me five unique numbers along with two symbols from this you can often work out right away if the correct solution will be of that sort of layout or if its going to be something more like or like wordle right but with is pretty much the pitch for everything here but globle likely takes it to the extremes its like wordle right but with the entire planetthankfully youre not guessing words from all of earths languages but rather the slightly more simple feat of guessing the name of one of earths countries since highlighting bits of the guess wouldnt help here globle instead opts for a hotcold system with your guesses marked in increasingly deep shades of red depending upon how geographically close it is to that days destinationit also gives you as many guesses as you need meaning you couldand now i desperately want todeliberately attempt incorrect guesses before seeing the correct nation turn greenthere are some flaws with globle which are yet to be addressed despite the games enormous popularity large countries really flummox its heatmap approach with russia especially causing problems please no and well theres a fair amount of luck involved in picking the right part of the planet to start inalternatively theres worldle a game you have to really convince google to let you search for this appeared before globle and requires that you recognise a country by its outline shapethis time the hint system is used to show you how close you are to the correct location telling you how many kilometers away you are and in which direction to headfrankly kudos to anyone capable of this feat because unless its italy or great britain im pretty stuffedxordle is a sister game of fibbles insomuch as it shares the same coder one keldor this is keldors own project and its another superb variant that feels like it should be too hard yet is definitely possible this time you have to guess two completely different words in one single puzzleneither word shares any letters so the results youre getting for each of your eight guesses with a given starter word apply to both at the same time its about trying to eliminate things in the fewest moves possibleclearly youre getting a lot of conflicting information but you just have to be defiant pursue a word hard and once youve successfully found one youve then got abundant clues for the second anything above which contradicts the first correct word is now vital information along with the elimination of all five of those lettersthe game is programmed very well such that once youve found a word the virtual keyboards highlighted letters gray out the first solution doubly helping you toward your goalprimelalmost doesnt deserve inclusion because of its nighblasphemous failure to spell its name primle it definitely doesnt deserve inclusion because its a game in which you have to correctly guess a fivedigit prime number and i am not a robotyet include it i have because i know we have a lot of robot readers and im not one to discriminate and as it happens this is very achievable to us mere mortals tooif anything primel reduces the concept back to its mastermindlike origins essentially letting the ten possible numbers be ten different color pegs but with the added restriction that your solutions probably going to end in a are in fact at least two variants called hurdle and we may as well include them bothfirst up is arkadiums hurdle which strings together five games of wordle where the solution for the previous round becomes the starter word for the next except in the fifth round where the four previous solutions are put in and you only have two guesses to get the correct solution based on the clues given by those four wordsits an enjoyable version because it requires you to successfully complete four standard wordles in a row where any failure means the whole thing is over that really raises the stakes that final round is where things get really sticky since sometimes you just dont have enough good informationand yet ive completed it more often than not so you will toothe other hurdle leans even further into the mastermind approach to marking guesses where instead of telling you which particular letters are correct it just tells you that there are so many correctly placed and so many correct but in the wrong placeaccordingly it gives you eight guesses instead of the usual six but make no mistake this makes it a far harder puzzleok lets be honest this has barely anything to do with wordle heardle is a game about recognizing a song from its intro in as few seconds as you cancreated by a group of friends and then suddenly finding viral fame to millions of players this uses the aesthetics and onceaday principles of wordle but thats about it yet its fantastic and fits right inat the start youre given one second of a songs intro to recognize it by if you think you know it you can type in its name or artist into a text box and then pick it out from the list of hundreds of possible answers submit it to find out if youre right or not get it wrong and the game adds another second of audioyou can also skip if you just dont know with a second wrong answer adding another two seconds then three four and so on you have six guesses and if you get it right you can listen to the first seconds of the track to celebrate seconds of course because thats what you can get away with without having to pay royaltiesits very satisfying capturing that ancient name that tune vibe in a very modern way,en,685.0,Positive

players spend money in gacha games like genshin impact this means that the vast majority of players are subsisting on free gacha rolls from various ingame activities with a little bit of persistence you can improve your odds and save a pretty significant number of wishes gis rolls to use on the limitedtime character banners of your choice not all of these methods are grinding mobs eitherbanners are ingame storefronts where you can redeem your currency for randomized character rolls there are two kinds of banners limited and standard to wish on a banner a genshin player has to spend an item called a fate the most common way to obtain them is by exchanging primogems genshins free ingame currency through the ingame shop most players will have their primos converted automatically when they wish on a banner but you can also convert them by going into the shop menu clicking on the paimons bargains tab and going into purchase with primogems primos can be exchanged for either the acquaint fates or the intertwined fates both of which cost the same amount so remember it costs primos to make one wish or primos for a tenrollbe careful the blue acquaint fates can only be used on the permanent standard banner if you want a limitedtime character the ones heavily advertised during events then you have to exchange for the pinkblue intertwined fates they cost the same but the pinkblue ones are much harder to obtainseveral methods for obtaining free primogems include grinding but not all of them here are some of the common ways to earn primogems a currency that can be converted to fatesplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingthe easiest and most consistent way to earn primogems is completing up to four daily commission quests every day you can obtain primogems per quest and then a lump sum of primogems once you turn your completed assignments to the adventurers guild in any city that adds up to around fates every monthyou can also obtain varying amounts of primogems foralmost every major event has some minigame with free primogems attached to it including the current lantern rite festival while you can get varying rewards depending on your score the developers changed events a while back so that you dont have to be a very skilled minigames player in order to earn some primogems some minigames are combat oriented while others are more puzzlebased the number of obtainable fates varies depending on the number and type of minigameyoure awarded around primogems by opening chests in the open world some of these chests are tucked away in hardtofind corners while the ones surrounded by a reddish ring require you to defeat the surrounding enemies in order to open them some chests only appear if you solve a puzzle nearby if something seems a bit off try attacking it and seeing if it will spawn a treasure chestonce you reach the inazuma region the electro sigils that you obtain from opening chests can be exchanged for rewards at the sacred sakura tree which also includes a few fates you can earn up to acquaint fates and intertwined fates by finishing the sacred sakura it takes electro sigils to obtain all the free fatescompleting combat challenges or finishing quests can sometimes net you an achievement you can obtain primogems per achievementthe spiral abyss is genshins endgame challenge mode and it awards primogems if you can clear all the enemies within a certain amount of time the rewards for floors are only obtainable once the rewards for floors reset on the and of every month this challenge mode is a hard dps check and casual players will struggle to clear all floors come prepared with a strategy and a wellbuilt team for each floor you can obtain a onetime total of fates for clearing the permanent floors and fates every month by clearing levels time the developers announce major game updates on their official twitch or youtube livestream they provide viewers with free primogem codes to redeem them go to settings then account and then redeem code these codes are valid for a day so be sure to activate them as soon as possiblewhenever you wish on a banner you get a small amount of stardust or starglitter currency every month you can buy up to five acquaint fates and five intertwined fates from the starglitter shop theres no limit to how many fates you can buy from the stardust shop but i would advise you to spend carefully despite the similar names stardust is harder to obtain than starglittertheres a white tree located near the entrance of dragonspine which is the wintery region near mondstadt the tree rewards you with items such as fates whenever you turn in enough crimson agates which can be found around dragonspine once you reach offering level you can take on weekly quests to earn agates you can get up to four acquaint fates and two intertwined fates from the treelogin events are extremely rare usually around twice a year theres always one during the lantern rite festival lunar new year but theyre otherwise unpredictable fortunately all you need to do is click on your daily login rewards in the events menu for seven nonconsecutive days a total of intertwined fates can be obtained per login eventthe battle pass is a meter that tracks how many tasks youve finished every season a season is roughly five weeks you can obtain up to five acquaint fates every season if you dont pay for the bpyou can obtain up to three acquaint fates for leveling each character that you have an acquaint fate is awarded at level and from major seasonal events theres no fast and easy way to obtain piles of wishes for free but if you log in regularly and attempt the challenges you can build up a respectable stash of fates by the time that your favorite character becomes available again remember playing genshin impact is not a sprint but a light jog that applies to obtaining the rarest characters too,en,356.0,Positive

tradition a bunch of digital storefronts have old and new star wars games on sale to mark the occasion so ill ignore how silly the whole concept of star wars day is if i can get some cheap games out of itto help you on your own personal journey to spend some cash on star wars ive put together a list of games that are currently on sale and worth grabbing based on this post on the official star wars website these sales are running now though just how long you have to take advantage of them depends on the platform the xbox and switch sales wrap up on may all the steam deals end on may and all the playstation discounts go away on may may not be the flashy and fancy new battlefront but the classic star wars battlefront ii is a thirdperson shooter still worth grabbing for cheap thanks to its fantastic amount of modes and options want to play a botfilled freeforall battle between jedi and sith characters you can do that want to play as wampas fighting rebels on hoth you can do that too the game even has a fun expanded universeinspired singleplayer campaign starring the clone troopersboba fett may be the more famous bounty hunter but the clones dad jango is pretty cool too and bounty hunter lets you slip into his boots for an original adventure originally released on and gamecube bounty hunter is a thirdperson actionadventure game set before the events of attack of the clones it was ported to and cleaned up a bit though be prepared for some camera control and gunplayplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingits a little unfair to say this is just doom star wars but also thats a great pitch for a game and it turns out that dark forces is pretty damn good some have even called it the best star wars game ever i wouldnt go that far but it perfectly captures the look and feeling of the original films in an exciting classic fps that still holds up in unleashed is a silly overthetop at times straightup bonkers thirdperson action game starring darth vaders apprentice starkiller even back before disney removed most of the eu from canon this game always felt too absurd even for star wars but dont let the absurdity and wild action scare you away no all of that is why unleashed is on this list

lego star wars the skywalker saga is a wonderful game filled with worlds and missions based on all mainline films but the classic complete saga which ironically isnt complete anymore is still worth checking out for its own lowerbudget charm and silliness while i prefer the new game over the old one theres no denying that complete sagawith its older chunkier lego piecesis a very nostalgic game that mostly holds up thanks to simple but fun gameplay and controlswhile its not the first star wars racing game ever made its easily the best building upon the podracing action found in the original pod racer on racer revengefirst released on improves just about everything adding more tracks and racers while also greatly improving the visuals and controls even in it still looks and plays wella tactical firstperson shooter set during the clone wars starring a badass group of elite clones sounds like one of those fan projects you read about for years but never gets released but nope back in

least pick up this game on a few different platforms for cheap during the ongoing salesdo you know what kind of star wars game we havent gotten in a long time a realtime strategy game that sucks but

tone of geography of robots southern gothic pointnclick adventure norco fascinates me its conflation of a recognisable louisiana and dystopian science fiction creates an oppressive darkness that weighs on my mind as i click through the games mindmap menu where memories and ideas can be connected via dialogue choices closing that down to remember i was standing in a regular kitchen the microwave in the corner possibly containing a cockroach shell somewhere in its works was dizzyingclearly taking some heavy direction from disco elysium including the formatting of its text in panels on the left or right of the screen norco is a stunning piece of magical realism fiction on its surface this is a story about a woman in her kay returning to her childhood home in the aftermath of her mothers dying of cancer her brother is wayward missing the house is still alive with her mothers halffinished chores and well theres a robot in the backyardyour first tip that this isnt quite our world is the years theyre denoted as letters and numbers for instance the second is definitely the incredibly sophisticated selfaware robot called million whose translucent face swims with starlike lights and yet despite this norco far more often feels like our recognisable reality than some sort of sciencefiction dystopia instead all its dystopian ways are far more immediately relatableburied treasure is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that arent getting noticed elsewhere you can support the project via its patreonset along the banks of the mississippi this is a grim rundown place where frequent flooding has left its stain on the land developments from big business are creating environmental catastrophe while a more prevalent sense of melancholy infects the areas citizens there is an allpervading lack of hope here into which you can lean or avoid in how you respond to the games narrative choices choices that range from the nature of your relationships with family decided arbitrarily by you near the start all the way to momentbymoment actionsplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingthe story grows as you play from this family matter to one that reminded me in superb ways of one of the best pieces of television ever the leftovers both share that same subtle mendacity the creeping feeling that far too much is far too wrong even though at the surface things may appear fine theres a peculiar cult a concerning corporation and the nagging lack of your brothers presence all weaving their way through both kays tale and those of her mother told in alternating flashbackwhile there are inventory puzzles to solve this is a game primarily focused on its writing overlaying its wonderful pixel art its one of those games that when i think about it i see in lavish watercolour and then am surprised again when i see the pixel art in the screenshots thankfully its also the writing that shines the brightest itself embracing that magical realism theme often poetic yet stark and pessimistic as an example i want to share a couple of chunks outofcontext the first is just a dismissible description when looking to the west near an overpasswest is the suburbs that catherine calls homewest is the concrete expanse that breaks clean and sharp at the saint charles parish line and gives way to the cypress swamptupelo crowns spire above the overpass silhouetted by an unnatural glow that leads to norcothen this is from a puppet show you can choose to watch in which a crocodile tells the story of the loss of its child which itself then develops into a peculiar diversion in which you can seek gruesome revenge for the crocdeep in this cypress hollow i hide i mourn this evening my last child has diedthey hang hooks from the trees with chicken thighs they shoot bullets in our heads behind our eyesit is a curse that i am the last to survivei was once captured by a fisherfool who called me is own he walked me like a dog along the sinking streetshe fed me strange plants and deli meats he even covered me with blankets when i went to sleepi left on the night of a monstrous flood the fool has not rested a single night sincei love it i love how it all leaves me only threequarters understanding which is true throughout the game this is especially true of characters who speak in deranged riddles reminding me a lot of stewart lees cruelly forgotten novel the perfect fool i love how despite the obviously underlying themes of environmental disaster the game never feels preachy or cautionary it just isthis is a fascinating creation brilliantly unsettling and uncanny that plays its cards with enormous subtlety its so interesting to see southern gothic depicted so effectively in a video game and leaves just the right amount of mystery by the endthis article originally appeared on buried

into me within the first hour or i immediately bounce to something else ive never had any patience for this it gets good after ten hours nonsense a game either understands its own brilliance or it doesnt and only titles that fearlessly believed in their own vision had what it takes to earn a spot on my first annual personal top ten listfata morgana is the most creatively audacious visual novel that ive ever played usually im not a huge fan of media that utilizes violence for shock value i find them bland and creatively lazy this game is neither of those things fata morgana inflicts crushing amounts of unearned tragedy on its incredibly likeable characters just when i thought that the worst of it was over the situation would worsen to unbearable heights while i was playing i just wanted a nicer explanation for everything that happened thats how stories were supposed to work i thought you get past the gritty bits to be rewarded with crumbs of hope i kept waiting and wishing until it was clear that i would remain disappointed despite that i kept playing after a while i was fully prepared for the game to bring its worst after watching several tragedies unfold i was no longer dependent on being rewarded by the narrator and that changed everything about how i consume stories fata morgana is one of those games that forced me to reckon with my own role as a readerdont read the spoilers just play the gameplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingthis comicstyle platformer gave me what i really needed during a year when our government was constantly failing us a lovable vigilante who believes in oldschool justice i wrote a lot of words about the cultural context and why tianding is important as an art game but really its just fun to steal from the rich and lay the kung fu on some cops along the waywhile octopath has an immensely fun turnbased combat system this game earned a spot here mainly because i cant stop listening to its gorgeous soundtrack its soothing intensely haunting and kept me sane while i was trying to buy groceries during a global pandemic i really couldnt imagine making it through this year without octopathwhen i booted up tales of arise i was expecting a tales game but with more budget its absolutely that but its also a surprisingly ambitious story about revolution empire and shared struggle more importantly it just feels really damn cool to be slamming down finishing moves with my favorite party members ill be grinding in this game well into know i know i wrote a harsh review of it earlier in the year because i wanted neo to be just like its predecessor i wanted it to eviscerate me and lay my heart bare i resisted the notion that the game should just be allowed to be a feelgood jrpg for mainstream consumption after my initial disappointment i settled down and found myself enjoying the killer art style and banger soundtrack its a solid sequel that experiments with interesting partybased mechanics come for the story but stay for the most stylish video game location of someone wanted a quick and dirty explanation of wildermyth id tell them that its xcom for fantasy nerds the main difference is that it goes a lot harder on personal narratives for each of the individual characters than i would expect see wildermyth is mostly procedurally generated you can randomize your characters appearance gender sexuality and background their personal arcs are defined by random lifealtering events but the writers have authored so much loving detail that i sometimes forget that my characters are determined by a cold and unfeeling dice rollthese diceroll people are real to me thats all that really matters isnt itheres how most choices in video games are presented kill the npc or let them live tell someone a truth that will hurt them or lie save the few or the many in chicory theres only one important choice blue or orange dots or stripes bombastic colors or the serenity of pure white my character in chicory was given a paintbrush and asked to paint every part of the games levelspainting chicorys setting was a responsibility that allowed me to define the game world in a very tangible way but my decisions carried none of the usual choice paralysis everything i did was inherently correct everything was permanent until it wasnt chicory deserves a spot on this list solely for allowing me to affect the environment in ways that were personally meaningfuli want to save the world i want to leave my mark on it but i also dont want to make a bunch of mistakes and fuck it all up chicory is the answer to all of those impulses and its super satisfying toostarsong has the most impressive moodsetting and worldbuilding of any game that i played this year its galaxy feels both human and inhumane intimate and distant starsong wraps violence in soft colors and a gentle soundtrack but it never loses sight of the violent systems that have shaped every aspect of its characters factions and settingsraise your hand if you saw this coming thats right the game that i plug at least hours into every week has made my goty list and for good reason the updates have been reliably consistent the new features genuinely improve my enjoyment of the game and the fan content that comes out of this community is unparalleled im always looking forward to every major genshin patch and i suspect that next year wont be any differentive only finished three ace attorney games and i never planned to go any further than that but then a complete stranger practically begged me to play the great ace attorney chronicles sure i thought i could spare a few minutes here and there to solve some murders i started playing this game five days ago and ive been binging it nonstop every day sincegaac completely blew past my previous experiences with the series while its filled with the usual quirky jokes and outlandish personalities it also tells a surprisingly mature and nuanced story about class gender race and empire theres still the old emphasis on solving puzzles and presenting evidence after all the british legal system is modern and scientific yet chronicles is willing to sabotage its own gameplay to prove to the player that truth is inherently political i wasnt just piecing together the truth behind these grisly murders the game invited me to challenge the superiority of the british empireto say that chronicles is an ace attorney game would be selling it woefully short its an absolute mustplay for anyone whos interested in visual novels or detective fiction,en,585.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/hello-kotaku-its-me-your-new-eic-1847192727,"Hello Kotaku, It's Me, Your New EIC",hello kotaku we meet again but this time nobody can stop mei kid i kid truthfully ive been avoiding writing this postthe one that acknowledges im back and also im in charge now at first this was easy being hired two weeks before meant i had little time to do anything but plan for the show but now its weird to keep publishing stuff without announcing myself more officially so here i am and this is itits a scary proposition to write this post because it means laying out my vision for the site and writing it down like this means that you know what it is that i want to do but more crucially get to judge if im living up to the standards that i set out thats terrifying because what i want for kotaku isnt just ambitious of course i want more readers of course i want to publish fearless writing criticism and reporting and of course i want to foster a community where everyone feels welcome somehow thats the easy partmany of these things are a continuation of what kotaku is already known forbut also i want to dismantle and redefine what a video game website can be i do not like what i see where to even begini hate that nearly every websites day to day is predicated on the release schedule and news cycle set by publishers i hate the coverage cycle of bigbudget video games and how a game is never more important than when it doesnt exist yetor when it just launched i hate that so much of what video game websites consider worthy of coverage is often written for a specific type of presumed reader it does not matter if a website is considered progressive it says everything that when writing about certain issues video game websites often have to take care in explaining basicass concepts like racism is realat some point having to explain power dynamics over and over again is not a question of informing the readership it is a tacit acknowledgement that our audience likely has a specific background and consequently that reality means that even as we cover more mainstream subjects or marginalized identities the writing is not truly for that wider audience this haunts me the presumed reader looks or sounds nothing like me and yet here i am leading a video game siteplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingits not a matter of being woke it is a matter of survival video game websites as they exist now repeatedly fail to represent the wide swath of people who play games and every year that passes this failure becomes more and more evident everyone plays games now yet most of these people hardly frequent video game websites unless they need to know how to do somethingand if we do reach this mythical mainstream gamer its likely because google willed itnot because weve cultivated that dedicated readership since social media websites throttle who can or cannot see our work we spend our time worshipping the fickle seo gods your favorite game website is likely quietly bankrolled by guides and service writers who try to predict what people will search next not news writers critics or reviewers playing that traffic game and being good at it of course is only a temporary salve yesterday it was facebook today its google tomorrow who knowshilariously gaming websites fail the capital g gamer repeatedly too the perpetual focus on whats coming next is not compatible with the idea that we are here to cut through the hype dont preorder games we say while dutifully covering the big event that exists to get you excited about the next big thing meanwhile advances like xbox game pass destroy the release cycle modern gaming websites have relied on for years whats new and shiny has no bearing on what will actually take off with the public as evidenced by among usnew in and of itself might be an outdated concept in the age of remakes remasters and rereleases across generations the last two years have had a dearth of showstopping game releases between coronavirus and a new console generation yet at the same time there are more games than ever old releases not new games perennially top the gaming charts of late im beginning to think my future grandchildren might still have to play the same ducttaped version of gta online that i haveits tough to wrangle all of this but its not like websites dont try here at kotaku we have this concept of embedding within games best described as an effort to continue covering games as they evolve and grow when i was at polygon we called these living games but the same basic idea applies games get updates audiences change we try our best to reflect that on the page as it actually exists not as pr saysbut video game websites as they exist now cannot truly keep up with our subject matter games are now designed to take up as much of your time as possible sometimes even punishing you for not logging in daily being up to date on certain big games is a job unto its own only achievable if you focus solely on that title aloneor at least only a few of them but the mandate of a video game website is to cover widely we have to make choices about which games we dig into and which games we cover more casuallyall of this has to be balanced with publishing daily multiple times a day these pieces also require time to research and report doing this job well often means sacrificing free time even as video game outlets try to provide writers with better conditions like having game time during work hours most people who do this for a living clock out and then log in to whatever theyre covering next when the perfect game is one that gives you dozens of hours of playtime there just arent enough hours to stay abreast of everything thats out there not if you want to produce thoughtful writing anywayburnout is endemic which is ironic when you consider the ongoing push to highlight crunch conditions at studios but because playing video games does not really seem like work its not something reporters can talk about freely without sounding like assholes woe is us its a tragedy that we have to sacrifice a weekend to properly cover that big game that isnt available to the public yet what is there to complain about when we probably got that game for freevying for relevance versus dwindling time is sometimes only the start writers especially those with marginalized identities often have to grapple with nonstop anger anger over suggesting that video games reflect the real world in any way shape or form anger that we get paid to do something many people would gladly do for free anger stoked by influencers who need you to believe game journalists are awful and they alone have your interests at heart anger fueled by four years of constant propaganda that mainstream media is fake news and not to be trusted anger that the news we report sometimes doesnt present video games and its communities in a positive light to the wider publici do not think this latent yet ongoing anger comes from the majority of our intended or presumed audience really its likely not even statistically significant compared to the millions of readers who read our work daily and love what we do but harm does not require an army all it takes is one asshole going out of their way to ensure a writer sees their bigoted screed theres always at least onei do not want to tell my writers to grow thicker skin though inevitably they do i want the world to be a kinder place it shouldnt require bravery to write about fucking video gamesbut what im getting at here is that i am terrified about my tenure at kotaku because i am an idealist realistically a lot of what i just described cannot possibly be changed by a single person or even a team of people by printing this i am opening myself up to criticism every time i dont change all the larger forces governing this work i havent even touched on institutional struggles here but they arent a secret to anyone who has read any go media sites over the last few yearsfailure seems inevitable but i am the sort of cursed person who cannot shoot for anything less than changing the way the game is played what would that even look like anywayi want kotaku to reflect things that are real i want to print stories that youd be able to tell a friend about at a bar even if they dont play games the way that we talk about games on the site should be the same way that wed talk about it in an actual conversation i do not care if the language or attitude at kotaku appears proper and respectable fuck that games are human and so are we any time there is a discrepancy between what we actually think and what lives on the page is when we betray not only our readers but ourselvesi want to move away from treating gaming like a product or industry instead examining them more as microcosms for the human condition games are worlds unto their own often developing not only customs traditions and dedicated languages but also their own vectors of power and influenceyeah the biggest youtuber in the world started out playing video games and sure pokmon go took over the outside world for a summer a few years back the largest entertainment properties on earth are created using game engines and nearly everyone has a device that plays games now the list of reasons why games matter is long and if youre reading this chances are good that you know much of this already i probably dont need to give you the whole spiel about how games are worth billions and are technically larger than businesses like the movie industryi mention these accomplishments not to prove gaming is worth taking seriously but to take that thought one step further if games are indeed as important as we say they are then we should feel comfortable enough to hold them to a higher standard if we truly respect this space we should be able to challenge the video game industry its products and the communities surrounding it if we want the world to stop treating games like mere toys we also have to stop treating video games like a wilting flower that must be protected at all coststhe challenge for a gaming website like kotaku is finding the right balance in coverage much of what i just described is the basic mandate of any good news organization nothing but the truth is treated as sacred the harder sell is that a website can do all of that while also retaining a sense of humor games matter but also games are silly and weird because humans are silly and weird stating the truth is not just about reserving space for heady topics its giving ourselves permission to have some fun on the pagesome of what ive outlined is a continuation of the approach started by my predecessor stephen totilo but i dont want just more kotaku with a different stable of writers and editors why bother the future of kotaku to me spans beyond video games games will always be the driving force but id like to think that what unites us isnt our willingness to hold a controller nerds are defined by fandom and an insatiable curiosity for how things work sometimes that drive and obsession unfolds in video games but not alwaysto properly showcase video game culture its necessary to talk about our digital lives more broadly we live in a world where your exercise bike has a leaderboard and language apps have daily challenges maintaining anyones attention now necessitates treating platforms their algorithms and their functions like systems that can be gamed and won games provide a crucial framework for parsing modern life and kotaku will now be an attempt to capture thati believe a different type of video game site is possible i hope you want to believe in that too,en,762.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/who-goes-there-the-kotaku-review-1846938074,Who Goes There?: The Kotaku Review,youve seen the thing right well this is the board game adaptationvery serious fans of the movie will already know that of course since who goes there is the name of john w campbell jrs original novel that the film is based on but i just wanted to get that clear up top since a working knowledge of either is going to help going forwards herewho goes there the game bearing the books name but with loads of visual cues lifted straight from john carpenters movie was originally released in and was pretty wellreceived albeit with a few fairly common complaints it returned a couple of years later in with a second edition which like a video game in need of some postlaunch care sought to address some of the original versions issuesi never played that first edition so im not going to be able to compare it to this im not sure ill ever want to play it though since even this newer revised version has some glaring issues that i would have thought would be caught and ironed out in a rerelease and ill get to those laterso whats the game actually like its official summary does an excellent job of getting the gist acrosswho goes there is a cooperative game of growing paranoia at the beginning of the game all players are human and there is no reason not to trust each other completely but as the temperature drops and mistakes are made players start doubting everything and everyone around themyou must build trade and upgrade to prepare yourself for the antarctic terrain rabid dog attacks crazed madmenand most importantly the alien entity that is now loose in the camp everything you build and upgrade has one purposekeeping you alive and human during the entire game you will want to trade with other players and help each other build stronger weapons and better equipment while also passing food and med kits around although make sure your trust them since trade is a huge opportunity for the thingstaying inside may keep you from freezing to death but it wont help you or your fellow humans win the only way to secure victory is by venturing out of the camp the problem with that is being away from camp is the number one way to come across the thingleaving you vulnerable and exposed to infection whether fixing the boiler repairing the door or fighting the frigid temperatures outside you will all need one another to survive but trust is a hard thing to come by when you must be wary ofwho goes therebasically then its a game where everyone is working together and trusts each other to try and overcome a perilous situation until its not and becomes instead a game where everyone suspects everyone else is secretly a murderous alien lifeform disguised by freezing human fleshthe goal is for every player to try and survive a set number of rounds normally and then at the end of that get onboard a helicopter and get the hell out of there who wins though depends on who exactly gets onboard that chopper with human players trying to keep infected alien monsters off while anyone infected is trying to pretend theyre not infected and smiling and getting onto the helicopter alongside the humans like everything was totally fine theres then a bunch of depressing math and luck to work out the winner and im not going to talk about that yet because it gets me down and i want to talk about all the good stuff firsteverything up to who goes theres endgame which is really of your time with it is fantastic its a wonderful adaptation of the thing really nailing both the desperation of the source as survival becomes increasingly desperate as well as the mounting suspicion everyone is feeling as it becomes clear theres an alien potentially hiding under anyones skinconditions are so brutal that its often tough just surviving in the first place with dog attacks terrible weather and exploding boilers making each round more dangerous than the last throw in the fact you need to head outside all the time to get stuff you need for the helicopter escape and then be secretly monitoring and worrying about everyone else at the table at all times and things get pretty stressful the closer you get to the endthe whole thing is all very tense and the fact youre all having to work together while at the same time trying to not work togethercooperating is essential for survival but cooperating is also the easiest way to alien players to infect humansreally makes the experience feel like youre playing through the second half of the movie juggling survival with a descent into madnessits such an enormous shame then that when the end finally comes it sucks if players are able to survive until all turns are over a helicopter comes to rescue you and its time for the tableyou can play with players but you really want that to be make some hard decisions the group leader who throughout the game has determined the turn order can be voted out of their position if other players suspect theyre the thing and whoever ends up in the job is responsible for choosing who gets to go on the chopper and who stays behind to dieeverybody making it into the chopper then adds up how many helicopter points they picked up throughout the game by braving the weather and going outside and finally rolls a special dice to generate more helicopter points and sees if they beat a required points threshold required for victory theres a catch though if any infected made it into the chopper you have to deduct their points from the totalto win the humans need to beat that score requirement even if theylet the thing or multiple things onto the chopper with them and for the infected to win they need to have got at least one alien into the helicopter and see the humans not get the required scoreits an incredibly deflating way to end an otherwise great game for two reasons firstly its difficult getting an idea on who is infected simply through gameplay unlike other similar games like battlestar galactica so the vote at the end often felt like it was simply guessing rather than the result of any kind of longterm detective workand secondly a huge part of meeting your required points total comes from a dice roll i played this game twice and the first time the humans lost because an infected made it onto the chopper rolling a and i the human rolled a it hadnt mattered that over the past two hours id frozen my ass off getting three bonus helicopter points fighting off aliens and suffering frostbite because a single dice roll had negated the whole thingthis is bullshit taking such a significant part of the players agency out of their own hands at the end of hours of gaming sucks throw in the weirdness of being able to win despite letting aliens onto the chopper with you and the arbitrary nature of having to consult a flowchart to see if youd won or not and who goes there really does work overtime to

apology street left blizzard in and joined riot games the following yearhundreds of current and former employees from across activision blizzard have signed a letter to the companys management calling its response to a recent lawsuit alleging widespread sexual harassment and discrimination at some of its offices abhorrent and insultingreports included unwanted shoulder rubs being propositioned for sex sexual harassment within their first day and even a game around the office where men would try to grope one anothers genitals these allegations havent been as widely reported as the litany of testimonials from harassed women but they also point to how systemic the issues were at the companythe announcement of the walkout is accompanied by a statement of intent letter addressed to activision blizzard management the letter states that employees believe their values are not being reflected by management and issues a series of demands meant to improve working conditions for those subjected to harassment and discrimination these demands include an end to mandatory arbitration which forces complaining employees into extralegal mediation rather than public court cases revised recruiting hiring and promotion policies pay rate transparency and the hiring of a thirdparty organization to review the companys reporting policy hr department and executive staffblizzard has promised to remove content not appropriate for world of warcraft likely in response to ingame references to creative director alex afrasiabi this announcement comes after a short period of silence following the publication of a california state lawsuit against the company which alleges activision blizzard fostered a pervasive environment of harassment against its female employeesi want to recognize and thank all those who have come forward in the past and in recent days i so appreciate your courage every voice matters and we will do a better job of listening now and in the futureour initial responses to the issues we face together and to your concerns were quite frankly tone deafthe cosby suite was more than just a nickname or a joke based on images and comments afrasiabi posted on his facebook supplied to kotaku by a former developer at blizzard it was reportedly a boozefilled meeting place where many including afrasiabi would pose with an actual portrait of bill cosby while smiling it was also a hot spot for informal networking at blizzcon three sources told kotaku where people looking to make inroads at the company would go to meet and hang out with some of its top designerswhile not everyone can attend the activision blizzard walkout for equality there are other ways to show support for the employees of the company as they demand improved working conditions for women and other marginalized groups in the wake of their employers inadequate response to californias sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuita new open letter signed by almost current and former ubisoft employees announces their solidarity with the workers at activision blizzard demands movement from their own leadership and calls for systemic change across the entire video game industry axios reportswhen activision blizzard a company currently under fire for its discriminatory practices and rampant sexual harassment issues hires wilmerhale a law firm with a reputation for unionbusting heads turn and brows furrowa cybersecurity company whose security researcher had once been harassed by blizzard employees at a hacking conference charged the game developer a percent misogyny tax when it sought a quote for security services according to a new report from waypointbut whats notable here is that rather acknowledging that she as an executive employed in a leadership position at a company in turmoil had made a bad tweet and responded accordinglyby doing something like locking her account deleting the tweet or simply ignoring the criticism and getting on with whatever the rich do on the weekendshe began systematically blocking anyone even mildly critical of her decision to share a story about the perils of whistleblowing while her company is in the midst of historically shocking allegations brought on by employees testifying confidentiallyhonestly the sound of being booed by that many guys honestly in some ways that bothered me more than getting dismissed she said you had that initial cheer from the women in the crowd and then just wave boosbrack was one of only two people explicitly named in californias lawsuit which accused the now former head of blizzard of failing to deal with internal reports of sexual harassment and sexism including allegations that former world of warcraft creative director alex afrasiabi would try to put his arms around and kiss female coworkers at company eventsas dexerto points out the websites for both the overwatch league and the call of duty leagues removed reference to tmobile at some point in july on july both sported the tmobile logo by july neither did the entry period of tmobiles call of duty sweepstakes has quietly been canceled whats more team members for the new york subliners a call of duty team appear to have taped over the tmobile logo on their jerseys which youve gotta admit is hilariousyou said you would do everything possible to work with employees in improving our workplace wrote abk workers alliance the group also responsible for organizing last weeks walkout protest at blizzard headquarters in a statement sent to kotaku and yet the solutions you proposed in that letter did not meaningfully address our requests you ignored our call for an end to mandatory arbitration you did not commit to adopting inclusive recruitment and hiring practices you made no comment on pay transparencythe class action lawsuit claims that activision blizzard and its executives were aware of the companys issues of rampant sexual discrimination and workplace harassment during the periods these sox certifications were issued and knowingly left out that information the final sentence in the statement in particular reads false but has remained unchanged since appearing most recently in activision blizzards fiscal yearend report as the events of the past couple of weeks have proven ongoing claims and investigations have indeed had a material adverse effect on activision blizzards businessaccording to a new indepth report by axios several current and former activision blizzard employees either didnt trust hr to help them when they were harassed or were met with skepticism and pushback when they did try to report their issues to hrone of the things the hr rep commented on was that she was surprised i wasnt crying or i wasnt more hysterical one current employee told axios in regard to a time she alerted hr to being physically assaulted by a coworkerpr spin propaganda hypernormalisationwhatever you want to call it were collectively told over and over by people in power that what we witness and experience is bullshit and the bullshit they serve us back is whats actually true thats in part how a company with an increasingly documented history of not treating people rightbe it activision blizzard or amazoncom inccan say with a straight face that it really does care without being immediately laughed out of the roomthough some have renewed calls to boycott all activision blizzard products it remains far from clear whether thats something any developers at the company including the women most mistreated by it even support a boycott kotaku reached out to a number of current and former activision blizzard developers for their thoughts on how fans can best try to bring about change at the company some didnt respond others didnt want their comments to draw attention away from the abk workers alliances current list of demandsjesse mccree the namesake for overwatchs beloved cowboy fighter and most recently a designer on diablo was one of several current and former blizzard developers who appeared in an image of a blizzcon cosby suite obtained by kotaku the suite contained booze and a giant portrait of bill cosby and reportedly belonged to world of warcraft developer alex afrasiabilong hours low pay tremendous instability working in quality assurance qa for a video game studio is notoriously difficult and painstaking enough as it is without factors like these complicating matters yet for qa testers at activision blizzard a company that has come under fire in recent weeks for a whole host of troubling allegations these may come with the territory indeed a lengthy list of statements provided to kotaku by the abk workers alliance indicates as much alongside other troubling claims including pervasive hostility toward lgbt staffersover the weekend a fan spotted overwatch league casters brennon bren hook and josh sideshow wilkinson appearing to avoid saying mccrees name during the matches instead of saying mccree they referred to him as the cowboy as reported by dexerto hook and wilkinson both went on to like the tweet noticing the change and fellow overwatch caster mitch uber leslie tweeted earlier this week that he thought this was a good ideaneoxon also highlighted the fact that activisions logo is missing from the call of duty vanguard page on battlenet the companys digital storefront again kotaku confirmed this is a common inclusion on several of the platforms call of duty listings where activisions graphic can be seen positioned above the logos for games like modern warfare black ops cold war and black ops updated lawsuit alleges that activision blizzard has not been cooperative with californias investigation it cites activision blizzards nondisclosure agreements the requirement that employees must speak with the company before contacting the state department and the hiring of unionbusting law firm wilmerhale as examples of the companys lack of cooperationblizzard announced today on twitter that it will be renaming jesse mccree and delaying the start of overwatchs next story arc the change comes after the reallife developer for whom the cowboy character was named was let go from the company amid ongoing fallout from a california lawsuit accusing the company of widespread sexual harassment and discriminationin late july blizzard announced it was taking steps to remove inappropriate

unheardof request reggie filsaim wasnt yet president of nintendo of america heck he wasnt even an employeebut rather interviewing for a job yet he wanted to speak with satoru iwataduring the recruiting process the thenmarketing exec realized that he would need a strong working relationship with top brass at the nintendo co ltd ncl headquarters in kyotothe most important of whom was satoru iwata who had taken over as global president in may so naturally reggie asked to have a video conference with him but thats not how things were done at nintendowho does this guy think he is iwata has better things to do than meet with reggie similar sentiments echoed throughout the halls of nintendo in both kyoto and the us i found out years later that this had caused major issues at ncl and noa nintendo of america reggie writes in his newly released business biography disrupting the game from the bronx to the top of nintendo in retrospect and now with his full understanding of nintendo culture reggie can see how this request would be taken as unconventional or maybe even arrogantits arguable though that it wasnt really a surprise that filsaim would make such a request he wasnt your typical nintendo hire raised in the bronx the cornelleducated marketing whiz had been shaking up the advertising worldplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingand iwata was no runofthemill japanese exec he cut his teeth as a programmer on games like balloon fight earthbound and kirby his dev skills were good but so were his business ones iwatas success in running hal laboratory led to him joining nintendo in corporate planning in two years later he was named president when hiroshi yamauchi who ran the company since retiredmaybe it was because reggie was recruited for an executive role maybe iwata was intrigued but this unexpected request was not only greenlit it was also the start of a great friendshipthe video conference was set reggie was scheduled to speak with iwata for half an hour as he waited for it to begin reggie expected the company president to be joined by a translator but when the monitor flickered on there was iwata alone this made the meeting much more intimate as he controlled the cameras to zoom in and make it appear as if he was just across a table from me writes reggie he asked what he should call me please mr iwata just call me reggiethe two talked about the new gaming systems from sony and microsoft and the conversation went well beyond the planned thirty minutes reggie asked what nintendo was going to do to combat the playstation portable reggie accept the job and come to kyoto iwata said i will show you how we will continue to innovatereggie was offered the job and accepted and came aboard as the executive vice president of sales and marketing and after eight weeks on the job he arrived in kyoto at nintendos hq in january to see how the company was innovating during that trip he not only met iwata inperson for the first time but also spoke to miyamoto and saw the working ds prototype this was the beginning of a professional relationship that would include legendary press conferences and ad campaigns however it wasnt until when reggie became the president nintendo of america that the two became more than game industry professional acquaintanceswhen mr iwata or other ncl executives visited the us we would often have teamoriented dinners in the evening writes reggie these would be great opportunities to better understand one another and share personal stories and experience however when reggie was in japan he wouldnt typically meet with top nintendo brass for dinner i believe this was because mr iwata himself was a tireless worker staying in the office until late at night meeting with members of his executive team writes reggie they often had simple meals brought in and continued discussing new game development projects well into the eveningon one of reggies first trips to kyoto as the new president of nintendo of america that changed iwata asked him to join him for dinnersomething that reggie calls a great honor he knew that the nintendo exec rarely went out to dinner with his staff iwata took reggie to one of kyotos best restaurants where they dined on exquisitely prepared courses of sashimi local fish and seasonal vegetableswe shared stories about our childhoods writes reggie we laughed as we learned that each of us had read the entire family encyclopedia as young kids for reggie that meant a twentysixvolume world book encyclopedia set they talked about their passions and their journey to where they are it was then that iwata said something unexpected reggie you know we are very much alikemr iwata what do you mean asked reggie iwata was a worldclass game developer and the fourthever president of nintendo reggie in his own words was a brash marketer and disruptorreggie iwata said nintendo is a company where employees tend to stay for a very long time but you and i are outsiders sometimes nintendo doesnt merely feel like a very japanese company but rather even more insular it can feel like a company very specific to kyoto for most of its history its been a family business staffed with local employees from kyoto or neighboring osaka but iwata hailed from hokkaido he didnt speak the local dialect he wasnt a member of the yamauchi family iwata was an outsider just like reggiecontinuing iwata said that their unique challenge was to understand nintendos culture while at the same time pushing the company forward to do this it was necessary to listen to the employees to fully understand them iwata said it wasnt only reggie who had to do thisi have to do this too said iwata i am trying to push nintendo in a new way yet mr miyamoto and others have been part of the company for a very long time i need to make sure they are with me as we go on this journeyfor reggie this meal was a turning point it was at the conclusion of this dinner that i felt we went from being in a bosssubordinate or mentorprotg relationship to being friends reggie writes i would incorporate his insights into all my future workat nintendo and beyondsatoru iwata was first diagnosed with cancer in summer while he was in the hospital during those muggy months reggie was scheduled to be in japan for meetings he did what any friend would he asked to visitbut companies have their own culturesas do countries sometimes its important to understand them other times its necessary to question them to push at established boundariesthe two traded emails but iwata declined no this just isnt done in japan he wrote in an email business associates dont visit the hospital for each other reggie continued to respectfully push for a visit but iwata was adamant writing reggie no one from the office has come to see me but reggie challenged the idea that this was a business visit replying with all due respect mr iwata i want to visit you not as the president of nintendo of america but as a friendbeing an outsider has its advantages you may break the rules by simply not knowing what they are or by questioning them you may cause a calcified system to changeid like to believe my final push elicited that little smile he would give me when he realized that i just wouldnt take no for an answer writes reggie he relented and agreed for me to come visit him in the hospitalon the drive to the hospital iwatas thenrighthandman and now nintendo president shuntaro furukawa pointed out to reggie how unusual his request had been but in the wake of his request something changed iwata had even started to allow nintendo employees in kyoto to visit him in the hospitalmr iwata was excited about my visit writes reggie iwatas wife and daughter would be there too this delighted me since having his family there would make it even more of a friends personal visit versus a businessmans visitwhen reggie entered the hospital room iwata was there in a gown with a big grin on his face he looked healthy reggie did what he always did when meeting iwata he extended his hand for a handshake and the two had a personal conversation about how the nintendo president was doing the mood was upbeat and positive iwatas daughter even memorialized the visit by having her photo taken with reggiejust like his desire to speak with iwata during recruitment reggie was pushing the boundaries and challenging norms here it wasnt for business reasons it was out of his desire to see his friendthe following spring after iwata seemed to have bounced back and recovered he wanted reggie to travel to kyoto for a specific threeday period it was a sudden unusual request odder still was that he wanted the nintendo of america president in the kyoto headquarters at am instead of am when the companys workday officially began reggie walked into the marble lobby early that morning the office felt cold and sterile reggie went up to the seventh floor executive area and at exactly am he was shown into iwatas officewhile mr iwata had been the companys global president for well more than ten years at this point he had not moved into the formal large presidents office used by his three predecessors reggie writes instead he had preferred a simpler office with his desk at the head of a rectangularconference room setup that could hold up to twelve additional people besides two large tv screens iwata had cabinets full of books video games game accessories and controllers reggie had always thought that the office looked like it belonged to a game dev instead of the top exec at a global corporationthe two greeted each other only days earlier nintendo had announced it was entering the mobile market but first iwata had something more important to talk about reggie he said my cancer is backto see his concern and for him to bring me back to kyoto specifically to tell me in person heightened my anxiety and i focused on every detail he shared filsaim writes iwata switched gears and after he mentioned his personal news he focused on the companys new console which he said was critical to nintendos future that console was the nintendo switchthis conversational shift was typical for mr iwata he was prioritizing the business before his own needs reggie writes i am sure that in his mind now that we had talked about his personal situation it was time to move on to discussing the businessthe gaming world lost a great leader on july for reggie the loss was twofold he also lost a great friend the friendship that mr iwata and i had was deep writes reggie who left nintendo in april the foundation of their friendship was mutual respect as they admired the core capabilities that each brought to the company but it was also two men who saw their similaritiesmr iwata wasnt just my boss he wasnt just someone who valued me for my business acumen he was a friend and that friendship made a difference not just in my success at nintendo but in my lifedisrupting the game from the bronx to the top of

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/anno-mutationem-thinkingstars-rpg-kotaku-review-cyberpu-1848723396,Anno: Mutationem: The Kotaku Review,anno mutationem is an overly ambitious love letter with one too many recipients while the game has an interesting gumbo of ideas its story buckles under the weight of living up to the very properties it attempts to pay tribute to ultimately mutationems ending fails to deliver a satisfying or cohesive pursuit of this monumental undertakingthe game is a pixel art sidescrolling action game with rpg elements developed by thinkingstars you play as ann flores a highly skilled combattrained lone wolf as she hunts down the cyberpunk gangs and corrupt megacorporations that kidnapped her brother anno mutationem not to be confused with the longrunning anno realtime strategy series is thinkingstars first video game while mutationem does a serviceable job of constructing an intriguing world its preoccupation with paying homage to the media that inspired it distracts from the story its trying to tellmutationem makes overt references to popular scifi anime and video games including ghost in the shell blade runner nierautomata a smidge of drakengard and neon genesis evangelion in the game this feels more spread out over hours but in its twohour demo it felt like rapidfire callbacks while on paper drawing from these iconic properties is a nobrainer for a developers first video game mutationem boldly goes beyond just mirroring aesthetics and injects their varying highconcept ideas on what it means to be human into its plot as wellid liken this phenomenon to using all your favorite seasonings into a dish youve never made for the first time although those spices pleased your palate in their own dishes if combined haphazardly theyll only clash and overwhelm the same circumstance comes about when mutationem transforms its aesthetic references into plot pointsghost in the shell nierautomata neon genesis evangelion and the other media mutationem draws from have heavy esoteric lore of their own mutationem ties itself down by ceaselessly drawing comparisons to these other media plot points like gits introspective meditation on the human condition blade runners commentary on transhumanism through cybernetics and ngeseverything most notably end of evangelions third impact take root within mutationems story as well while the argument that every piece of media is a remix of elements a creator liked isnt lost on me mutationem becomes a poorly adapted cover to its inspirations rather than rocking to the rhythm of its own story beatsthis is a shame because buried under all these references is mutationems own unique premise interesting story elementslike the games povertystricken populace suffering from the mechanika virus a disease that slowly turns people into robozombiesend up jettisoned to give the game more time to retread ideas from other media because mutationem seems afraid to veer far from its inspirations which are imperfect themselves thinkingstars fails at telling its own storyjust when you expect the game to pay off your detective work and hardfought battles against mecha and hordes of cybernetically enhanced militia with some attempt to connect its disparate ideas it shortchanges you with a lackluster ending similarly to nge mutationem builds up to armageddon but its final boss comes out of left field basically the government organization in mutationem is seele from ngewith all the convoluted reasoning and imagery that impliesand theyre using alternatedimension tech to do something and must harness anns power to pull it off while the games been hyping you to fight anns alt dimension self amok you merely fight a dragon i felt robbed of an epic battle with the rival character i assumed the game was preparing me for and insulted by the blatant sequel baitthe gameplay ultimately disappoints too being the unapologetic devil may cry devotee i am games rewarding skillbased combat with gratifying feedback is a must while mutationems combat hints at being dmcs pixelart equivalent it proves to be a mixed bag of hype visuals and underwhelming grind the games combat systems promise a depth that never plays out in gameplay while mutationem allows you to customize deconstruct and forge more powerful weapons with elemental mods and unlockable weapon skills many of these cool bits only materialize near the games finale while you can access some of these abilities earlier through sidequests the game doesnt do a good job of letting you know seemingly railroading you into its convoluted main plotafter a couple hours fights dont really feel rewarding simply put enemies are damage sponges once you finally break an enemys shield which works as their second health bar you have a matter of seconds to wail on them to do some actual damage before their shields recover the rest is wash and repeatone simple answer to this conundrum would be to parry enemies more frequently resulting in big damage boosts but the rewards for doing so are negligible and your foes have confusing hitboxes if you miss a parry thats a chunk of your health gone for the attempt i had to go out of my way to parry bosses by lining up with their hits instead of letting them come organically instead of trusting the game to make my parries count i developed the instinct to dodge roll constantly because it was the only safe and assured method for maintaining anns health and dealing damagewhile early boss fights are unique mutationems latter half pulls a halo by throwing multiple versions of the same boss at you sometimes fielding two more directly after you prime the first for a finishing blow boss fights increasingly felt like wars of attrition rather than the fastpaced battles of skill the game advertiseshave neko car will travelthinkingstarssidescrolling actionrpgplaystation playstation pcgorgeous pixel art wacky npcs and the endearing dynamic between the games main character and sidekickmarch story underdeveloped villains lore dumping and lackluster hours many of which were fighting frustrating boss battlesoutside of combat mutationem suffers from the same cognitive dissonance as the yakuza series with its sidequests and main missions feeling like two separate games while mutationems main quest comes off like an aigenerated anime scifi plot its sidequests unabashedly tell wacky and heartfelt stories that characterize the people who inhabit its world much of my enjoyment with mutationem came from straying from its main quest avoiding paths or hallways that looked like progress led me to discover bizarre npcs who all had written dialogue and receive snippets of their experiences in mutationems dystopian cyberpunk societymy favorite interactions came from running into a sewerdwelling man with a manhole cover for a face discovering the secret identity of a virtual pop idol and witnessing the final moments of a robot reaching enlightenment in the sewers these brief encounters left longlasting impressions making its underutilization of these fresher concepts within its larger story all the more frustrating instead of reveling in rich storytelling i was collecting a tally of how many plot elements from other media with which mutationem garnished its storyto make matters worse the game introduces cookiecutter villains who suffer from the annoying trope of being vague about their intentions instead of simply telling you just what the fuck is happening and what they want out of ann they simply say theyll see her again in the worst archetypical anime villain style these guys even look identical aesthetically sometimes even mirroring allies while the games latter half attempts to curb this by introducing villains with bizarre new looks these intricately designed doublecrossers writing is just as flat as that of their predecessors aside from the two leads the main cast is boring and unimaginative leaving the incidental environmental npcs to breathe life into mutationems worldstorytelling and combat aside two high points come in the games impressive art direction and the winning dynamic between its main characters the stunning visuals of mutationems setpieces almost supersede the imagery of the media its homaging ann and ayane are also really cute their banter in between main quest and sidequest content was worth the many brutal deaths and consequent eruptions of cmon man i yelled when barely photofinishing enemiesas thinkingstars first game anno mutationem boldly swings for the fences by throwing every cool concept it has at players mutationems unbalanced focus in its story is its critical failure at one moment its an animeinfused cyberpunk openworld rpg in the next its a rigid storydriven metroidvania but when it tries to meet in the middle its pacing screeches to a halt depriving its latter half of the charm of its wacky worldbuilding npcs and replacing it with long stretches of exposition conveyed through dry codexes and vague anime archetypes sporting unclear motivationswith the games ending hinting at a possible sequel mutationem stands as a messy first draft if a followup does come i hope thinkingstars will have the confidence to boldly stand and tell its own unique story rather than remain so shackled to its inspirations,en,703.0,Positive

outdid itself warioware twisted delivered a new slew of rapidfire microgames but paired them with incredible motion controls that made the game boy advance function a bit like a steering wheel the games cartridge contained a bulbous rotational sensor that could click with each gradual movement creating a bizarre and tactile gaming experience the result was an extraordinary offering of tiny

is the rare game that sneaks up on you the kind of game you dont even see coming yet turns out to be incredible a pointandclick adventure game first released back in february i hadnt heard of it until last month when folks i follow in games media started more and more loudly singing its praises now having played it myself i understand why its an extraordinarily affecting journey one i cant recommend strongly enough i walked away from writer and artist meredith grans debut game feeling a wave of contradicting yet intertwining emotions frustration and joy longing and warmth hope and regret anger and love this nostalgic comingofage story about a teenage girl in the early and the ephemerality of adolescence fucked me up it took me back to my own childhood nicking old wounds and poking burnt coals with such specificity i couldnt tell if i was playing a game or reliving parts of my life either way i loved every bit of itdeveloped by the creator of octopus pie a comic series about two women living in new york that ran from perfect tides has a similar kinda vibe the story follows mara whitefish an almost her birthdays in a couple of months ok leave her alone jewish girl living on the remote island of perfect tides city kids dream of running away to this idyllic archipelago while residents especially children cant stand being on it why because there aint shit to doas mara puts it there are no cars no department stores no asphalt or steel no nothing its the kind of place where rich folks have summer homes and where queer people can probably feel safe but also a bit suffocated by the deeply conservative culture of selfexpression on the island and its easy to feel trapped in this picturesque but limiting landscape hell the only way to get off the islet is by ferry boat which is also maras only way to high school perfect tides is far from perfect and no one wants to leave the boring and empty island more than mara and her one reallife friend lily it doesnt happenmara is still only in high school after allbut teenagers can dream and mara dreams a lot about her future overanalyzing her own every action in the hopes that they build into something romantically epicthis all shakes out in the form of a pointandclick adventure game similar to oldschool lucasarts or sierra entertainment classics like day of the tentacle and kings quest vi perfect tides will have you incessantly clicking around the screen with the prayer of finding out what to do and where to go next to be clear the puzzlesolving rarely presents any real roadblocks many of them are optional and whether you complete them or not doesnt prevent you from progressing but rather affects the games ending i find this fascinating the multiple endings and the actions you take to trigger them personalize maras journey based on your moral compass reflecting your ideals back to you however as cool as that is i was bummed to reach the end only to discover after the fact that id missed some of these optional puzzlesand as a result a few tender moments between characters i couldve experienced had i known and done themplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingfor example theres this one part around the summertime where if you happen to combine two different items they create something else that can be traded for a gift to be given to maras asshole of a brother during hanukkah in the winter altering the dialogue you get and the resulting ending optional actions like this are brilliant because they can illustrate both maras growth and our capacity to forgive others so my issue isnt that i didnt know the solution to this specific puzzle but rather that i didnt even know it was a puzzle an option to do or not do something and that completing certain puzzles can change the games ending i dont want games like this to spell out their puzzles solutions but perfect tides doesnt always adequately clue you in to what might be possible or how it will affect the world and its characters this does add some semblance of replayability thoughwhatever modest frustrations perfect tides puzzles may cause the narrative more than makes up for them it tells a complicated story about being a teen in the early with all the digital and real heartbreak that comes with adolescence in the internet age as well as all the melodramatic angst and intensity that being a teen can color the world with as the games four seasons pass mara transforms from an anxious fanfic writer and forum lurker intowhatever you make her as you play through this formative year in her life she can become more confident defining her ideals as she learns that people are fallible and occasionally let us down conversely she can retreat into herself as her relationships fizzle out mara is her own character as much as she is a conduit through which you can relive that era and as such it can resurface both comforting and painful memories if you happened to come of age in that era yourself which i didno i was not a jewish girl living on an island in the year and yet meredith gran imbues her characters with such emotional depth and nuance that i saw my own upbringing mirrored in so much of perfect tides waiting for the computer to connect to the internet feeling your ears bleed as the aol dialup noise screeched from the speakers befriendingand eventually datingan internet stranger watching friends slowly drift away contemplating the temptation of a quiet death with each ingame revelation each season coming to a close i couldnt help but wonder if meredith and i were the same or if the millennial experience was just that universaltheres something about the way meredith gran wrote mara the shackling insecurity that bars the teenager from normal social interactions that not only clued me into maras own erratic mental state but also reflected my own adolescent struggles back at me as if gran had some crystal ball peering into my life her depiction of teenage angst is on point and the push and pull between maras desires for intimacy and her inner critics overprotective nature is both frustrating and understandable its remarkable just how authentic these characters feel how they make mistakes sometimes even knowing how dumb those mistakes are even if you didnt grow up in the early the complexity compassion and humanity with which gran captures adolescence transcends its period setting capturing something real and true about the excitement and anguish of growing upas the credits rolled i felt a lot of regret for my mara who despite my best intentions made some of the same mistakes i did as a teenager many of which may have been avoidable if it werent for the desperate yearning for approval still theres hope for mara as a freshfaced shes got her whole life ahead of her one full of trials and tribulations but one worth living all the samethats probably the single most salient note to take away from perfect tides conclusion as long as there is breath in your lungs you can always start fresh mara might not leave perfect tides and many of her friends on the island may not remain so for long but theres comfort in knowing you can reinvent yourself every day its a lesson mara grows to accept regardless of the ending you wind up with and its a beautiful one we could all learn fromperfect tides is out now on itchio and steam,en,606.0,Positive

lot since the movies first excited my imagination ive spent far too much money on this franchise buying up games books comics and lego sets so understand that what im about to say comes from a place of pure love and care star wars is really silly and dumb and because of this its always nice when lucasfilm and disney let creative partners have fun with the franchisethats exactly what the wonderful lego star wars games have done in the past and to great success lego star wars the skywalker saga the newest game in the series continues this tradition of having fun with all the space wizards and talking puppets but does so now at a previously unseen scale the end result one of the best star wars games ever madelego star wars the skywalker saga a game that is somehow bigger than even its own clunky title was created by the folks over at tt games before i go any further into how much i liked it i want to mention that id have been happy waiting another six months or more for this game even after all the delays if it could have saved the devs from crunchingas reported by polygon earlier this year this latest lego game was created by a team that allegedly had to put up with unhealthy stresscausing workloads and whose concerns often got ignored by management its easy to look at a game this cute and silly and just assume it was made in a happy musicfilled candy factory all the workers laughing as they oneup each other creating the series trademark jokes but thats just not the reality and while i dont think folks should be punished for enjoying this game i also appreciate and respect people who decide to not play it its a shitty situation and one which tt games needs to avoid in the future for the sake of its own devsif you do decide to play skywalker saga youll discover that this is a giant game it covers all nine movies from phantom menace to rise of skywalker each episode includes five levels and a bunch of openworldlike action between each bigger setpiece with most episodes taking about two to three hours to complete assuming you dont get distracted by all the collectibles and hidden puzzlesas you complete levels and progress through the story you unlock more locations to visit in the games galaxyspanning free mode here you can bring an assortment of star wars characters with you and unlock previously unreachable areas using characters unlocked during the story missions with over characters and planets to discover i can easily see myself spending a few dozen hours combing through each gorgeous massive environment solving every puzzle and collecting all the hidden characterupgrading kyber bricksyou are never too old to enjoy some legos or pretend to be a jediopenworld familyfriendly actionadventure romp with light rpg elementswonderful humor how much star wars is packed in here impressive visuals modernsome minor bugs a few missing characters allegedly made under crunchtt xbox series xs played xbox one switch pcapril hoursunlike the past lego star wars games skywalker saga uses a behindtheback camera angle along with improved more modernfeeling combat and movement controls shooting feels like it was ripped right out of fortnite using an overtheshoulder aiming setup melee combat is also improved using a simple but fun combo system that features different attacks and the ability to block and counter that said you can still buttonmash through encounters which is nice considering how many younger kids will probably just do that instead of learning all the various combosskywalker saga is easily the bestlooking lego game ever made you now have full control of the camera letting you truly admire the incredible amount of graphical detail on display the worlds you visit effortlessly blend photorealistic cliffs and deserts with digital lego bricks almost as if you are a kid playing with legos in your backyard or sandbox as you explore deserts or swamps your lego characters will actually start to get dirty and even acquire scratches look closely enough and you can even make out the lego logo stamped onto their bodies and other brickbuilt ships and propsat one point i actually grabbed a lego star wars ship from my embarrassingly large collection to compare it to its digital counterpart i was shocked by how accurate it was even bits that didnt matter ingame like a small technic piece used to pop a droid out of its seat easily were included in the digital shipbut as i mentioned the real star of lego star wars is how deftly the game weaves in humor for example during the episode ii campaign you get captured and dragged into a large arena filled with nasty monsters one of them looks like a cat so the aliens who are holding you captive use a laser pointer to get its attention and make it attack you i laughed a lot and not just at that jokethis type of humor is found throughout and even if you dont care about the franchise i suspect the jokes and gags will keep you entertained throughout and if like me you love star wars the injoke references to the films and past lego games are a lot of fun tooi cant think of another star wars game thats included so much of the franchise in such a brilliant and wellmade package and does it all without becoming boring or bogged down in canon details and retcons star wars is silly star wars is epic lego star wars the skywalker saga knows this and embraces both aspects while being a lot of fun and very funny its one of my favorite games of and while some hardcore star wars fans may be loathe to admit it yes this is probably the best star wars game yet made,en,476.0,Positive

nintendo of america that the two became more than game industry professional acquaintanceswhen mr iwata or other ncl executives visited the us we would often have teamoriented dinners in the evening writes reggie these would be great opportunities to better understand one another and share personal stories and experience however when reggie was in japan he wouldnt typically meet with top nintendo brass for dinner i believe this was because mr iwata himself was a tireless worker staying in the office until late at night meeting with members of his executive team writes reggie they often had simple meals brought in and continued discussing new game development projects well into the eveningon one of reggies first trips to kyoto as the new president of nintendo of america that changed iwata asked him to join him for dinnersomething that reggie calls a great honor he knew that the nintendo exec rarely went out to dinner with his staff iwata took reggie to one of kyotos best restaurants where they dined on exquisitely prepared courses of sashimi local fish and seasonal vegetableswe shared stories about our childhoods writes reggie we laughed as we learned that each of us had read the entire family encyclopedia as young kids for reggie that meant a twentysixvolume world book encyclopedia set they talked about their passions and their journey to where they are it was then that iwata said something unexpected reggie you know we are very much alikemr iwata what do you mean asked reggie iwata was a worldclass game developer and the fourthever president of nintendo reggie in his own words was a brash marketer and disruptorreggie iwata said nintendo is a company where employees tend to stay for a very long time but you and i are outsiders sometimes nintendo doesnt merely feel like a very japanese company but rather even more insular it can feel like a company very specific to kyoto for most of its history its been a family business staffed with local employees from kyoto or neighboring osaka but iwata hailed from hokkaido he didnt speak the local dialect he wasnt a member of the yamauchi family iwata was an outsider just like reggiecontinuing iwata said that their unique challenge was to understand nintendos culture while at the same time pushing the company forward to do this it was necessary to listen to the employees to fully understand them iwata said it wasnt only reggie who had to do thisi have to do this too said iwata i am trying to push nintendo in a new way yet mr miyamoto and others have been part of the company for a very long time i need to make sure they are with me as we go on this journeyfor reggie this meal was a turning point it was at the conclusion of this dinner that i felt we went from being in a bosssubordinate or mentorprotg relationship to being friends reggie writes i would incorporate his insights into all my future workat nintendo and beyondsatoru iwata was first diagnosed with cancer in summer while he was in the hospital during those muggy months reggie was scheduled to be in japan for meetings he did what any friend would he asked to visitbut companies have their own culturesas do countries sometimes its important to understand them other times its necessary to question them to push at established boundariesthe two traded emails but iwata declined no this just isnt done in japan he wrote in an email business associates dont visit the hospital for each other reggie continued to respectfully push for a visit but iwata was adamant writing reggie no one from the office has come to see me but reggie challenged the idea that this was a business visit replying with all due respect mr iwata i want to visit you not as the president of nintendo of america but as a friendbeing an outsider has its advantages you may break the rules by simply not knowing what they are or by questioning them you may cause a calcified system to changeid like to believe my final push elicited that little smile he would give me when he realized that i just wouldnt take no for an answer writes reggie he relented and agreed for me to come visit him in the hospitalon the drive to the hospital iwatas thenrighthandman and now nintendo president shuntaro furukawa pointed out to reggie how unusual his request had been but in the wake of his request something changed iwata had even started to allow nintendo employees in kyoto to visit him in the hospitalmr iwata was excited about my visit writes reggie iwatas wife and daughter would be there too this delighted me since having his family there would make it even more of a friends personal visit versus a businessmans visitwhen reggie entered the hospital room iwata was there in a gown with a big grin on his face he looked healthy reggie did what he always did when meeting iwata he extended his hand for a handshake and the two had a personal conversation about how the nintendo president was doing the mood was upbeat and positive iwatas daughter even memorialized the visit by having her photo taken with reggiejust like his desire to speak with iwata during recruitment reggie was pushing the boundaries and challenging norms here it wasnt for business reasons it was out of his desire to see his friendthe following spring after iwata seemed to have bounced back and recovered he wanted reggie to travel to kyoto for a specific threeday period it was a sudden unusual request odder still was that he wanted the nintendo of america president in the kyoto headquarters at am instead of am when the companys workday officially began reggie walked into the marble lobby early that morning the office felt cold and sterile reggie went up to the seventh floor executive area and at exactly am he was shown into iwatas officewhile mr iwata had been the companys global president for well more than ten years at this point he had not moved into the formal large presidents office used by his three predecessors reggie writes instead he had preferred a simpler office with his desk at the head of a rectangularconference room setup that could hold up to twelve additional people besides two large tv screens iwata had cabinets full of books video games game accessories and controllers reggie had always thought that the office looked like it belonged to a game dev instead of the top exec at a global corporationthe two greeted each other only days earlier nintendo had announced it was entering the mobile market but first iwata had something more important to talk about reggie he said my cancer is backto see his concern and for him to bring me back to kyoto specifically to tell me in person heightened my anxiety and i focused on every detail he shared filsaim writes iwata switched gears and after he mentioned his personal news he focused on the companys new console which he said was critical to nintendos future that console was the nintendo switchthis conversational shift was typical for mr iwata he was prioritizing the business before his own needs reggie writes i am sure that in his mind now that we had talked about his personal situation it was time to move on to discussing the businessthe gaming world lost a great leader on july for reggie the loss was twofold he also lost a great friend the friendship that mr iwata and i had was deep writes reggie who left nintendo in april the foundation of their friendship was mutual respect as they admired the core capabilities that each brought to the company but it was also two men who saw their similaritiesmr iwata wasnt just my boss he wasnt just someone who valued me for my business acumen he was a friend and that friendship made a difference not just in my success at nintendo but in my lifedisrupting the game from the bronx to the top of

mothers dying of cancer her brother is wayward missing the house is still alive with her mothers halffinished chores and well theres a robot in the backyardyour first tip that this isnt quite our world is the years theyre denoted as letters and numbers for instance the second is definitely the incredibly sophisticated selfaware robot called million whose translucent face swims with starlike

puts to bed any doubt that nintendos pink puffball can more than carry his own adventure gamedespite its semiopenworld setting the game doesnt get swallowed by the vastness of its new format for clarity forgotten land is not technically an openworld game as its areas are segmentedbut for the sake of brevity we will describe it as such forgotten land is intuitive without holding your hand allows you to explore the gameplay the way you want and is stuffed with a ton of formidable enemies and hidden environmental details in betweenone day while chilling in dream land a rift tears open in the sky and sucks up waddle dees in an attempt to rescue the waddle dees our hero kirby winds up getting isekaid into a dystopian world that resembles our ownimmediately forgotten land distances itself from prior kirby games with the injection of a perilous antiutopia while previous titles amounted to breezy kirby visual novels forgotten land is a greek epic chocked full of imposing titans kirby must conquer and gone are the ontherails tours through picturesque sidescrolling landscapes where you overcome enemies with the power of friendship and kirbys bottomless lung capacity now you must boldly march into the unknown armed as the throat goat while investing time and resources into upgrading powers of your choosing this dark change of pace made forgotten land an invigorating adventure from start to finish without becoming overlymelancholythe game begins with a rapture sure but kirbys baby coos when discovering new landscapes and triumphant dances after completing a level make the forgotten land feel more like the more upbeat kirby games of the past that is until you begin exploring other areas that become increasingly darkareas that were once idyllic paradises transform into hellscapes each brave pitterpatter from kirbys tiny feet plunges him deeper into forgotten lands progressively harsh climates barren landscapes and warmongering wildlifethe doomandgloom lurking around every corner of forgotten land is neatly underscored by the games foreboding soundtrack whether it be an abandoned carnival a desert vista or a foggy silent hill stretch across a snowy bridge kirbys soundtrack accentuates each land with its own unique vibe forgotten lands music effectively foreshadows the looming threat hidden in each environment while being pretty damn catchy to bootforgotten land makes it clear that the entire game is just one extended rescue mission yet it manages to keep gameplay fresh by pacing out challenges and giving maps their own mechanics forgotten land lets you pick and choose what gameplay you want to explore most there are treasure hunt time trials for platforming fans collaborative play for those who dont want to go it alone and of course the optional openworld objectives that will make a completionists heart singall of these elements can help in your mission whether thats in the form of upgrades a helping hand in fights or acquiring new loot but forgotten land never forces you to delve into these playstyles leaving you to make the game your ownthe game entices you to at least try exploring the different objectives though with a smart use of cues at the start of levels players are prompted with messages like there are five objectives you can complete which encouraged me to scour every crack in the wall or mysteriouslykirbyshaped anomaly for a hidden pathway or mysterious itemwhile kirby games arent known for their difficulty forgotten land adds a sense of nuance to traversal and combat after completing an area the game reveals objectives that you missed like finding a secret pathway or defeating a boss with a specific power without being hit or floating off the ground though you can mainline the game by blitzing through areas like skipping through a board game the games optional objectives transform into a checklist that encourages more thorough exploration of the games world and mastery of kirbys abilities but the game more heavyhandedly encourages this growth through its treasure hunt side queststhough i initially dreaded treasure hunts for dropping me into an obstacle course devoid of the games many inventive worlds they quickly became my favorite aspect of forgotten land for the challenge they presented when my brainrotten devil may cryesque swordsmanship made the first couple of worlds a cakewalk to get through it also didnt hurt that grinding through them allowed me to quickly level up my goto kirby powersnobody puts baby in a cornergrand scale of its progressively inventive levels the imaginative utilization of mouthful mode and the game balance of wholesome fun and harrowing adventurehal laboratorymarch openworld adventure gamefinnicky platformingnintendo hours many of which were spent perfecting treasure huntsthat being said forgotten land isnt without its issuesthe platforming can be finicky while a running start before jumping would usually give you more distance kirby interprets that input as you walking forward with no intention of jumping leading kirby to take the plunge into the unforgiving depths platforming johns aside you can rest assured that each stumble and stride during the trials and tribulations of kirby are generously rewarded in forgotten lands bombastic finaleand while forgotten land is rich with hazardous landscapes and foreboding music it is bereft of compelling new characters kirbys newest companion elfilin never becomes more than a cheerleader and guide and meta knights appearance is a cheap cameo in a coinfarming tournamentking dedede however is an absolute standout prior to forgotten land he was portrayed merely as a lazy unjust king but forgotten land breaks the mold by giving the old curmudgeon a chance for redemption in a stunning go ahead ill hold them back scene that could have been pulled straight from an action film subtle moments like dededes chivalry or kirbys many bugeyed surprised faces provide shorthand characterization and provide muchneeded levity in between kirbys treacherous globetrotting and hes essentially the last vestige of humanity before bonkers space shit happensfinally forgotten lands final act is ballstothewalls highoctane action alongside some thirdact smrgsbord of elements that evoked thoughts of akira bayonetta and even halo while any other games attempt at such an overblown twist might buckle under the weight of its own ambition forgotten lands finale never did because kirby is already an eldritch horror himself everything within forgotten lands batshit crazy ending felt like a slow boil of concepts the game dripfed you until finally blowing its lid in spectacular fashion showcasing every gameplay mechanic at its maximum potential within the final actfrom its rapture beginnings to its m night shyamalanlike twist ending kirby and the forgotten land is a shining example that kirby warrants his lions share of openworld treatment alongside other nintendo

only of players spend money in gacha games like genshin impact this means that the vast majority of players are subsisting on free gacha rolls from various ingame activities with a little bit of persistence you can improve your odds and save a pretty significant number of wishes gis rolls to use on the limitedtime character banners of your choice not all of these methods are grinding mobs eitherbanners are ingame storefronts where you can redeem your currency for randomized character rolls there are two kinds of banners limited and standard to wish on a banner a genshin player has to spend an item called a fate the most common way to obtain them is by exchanging primogems genshins free ingame currency through the ingame shop most players will have their primos converted automatically when they wish on a banner but you can also convert them by going into the shop menu clicking on the paimons bargains tab and going into purchase with primogems primos can be exchanged for either the acquaint fates or the intertwined fates both of which cost the same amount so remember it costs primos to make one wish or primos for a tenrollbe careful the blue acquaint fates can only be used on the permanent standard banner if you want a limitedtime character the ones heavily advertised during events then you have to exchange for the pinkblue intertwined fates they cost the same but the pinkblue ones are much harder to obtainseveral methods for obtaining free primogems include grinding but not all of them here are some of the common ways to earn primogems a currency that can be converted to fatesplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingthe easiest and most consistent way to earn primogems is completing up to four daily commission quests every day you can obtain primogems per quest and then a lump sum of primogems once you turn your completed assignments to the adventurers guild in any city that adds up to around fates every monthyou can also obtain varying amounts of primogems foralmost every major event has some minigame with free primogems attached to it including the current lantern rite festival while you can get varying rewards depending on your score the developers changed events a while back so that you dont have to be a very skilled minigames player in order to earn some primogems some minigames are combat oriented while others are more puzzlebased the number of obtainable fates varies depending on the number and type of minigameyoure awarded around primogems by opening chests in the open world some of these chests are tucked away in hardtofind corners while the ones surrounded by a reddish ring require you to defeat the surrounding enemies in order to open them some chests only appear if you solve a puzzle nearby if something seems a bit off try attacking it and seeing if it will spawn a treasure chestonce you reach the inazuma region the electro sigils that you obtain from opening chests can be exchanged for rewards at the sacred sakura tree which also includes a few fates you can earn up to acquaint fates and intertwined fates by finishing the sacred sakura it takes electro sigils to obtain all the free fatescompleting combat challenges or finishing quests can sometimes net you an achievement you can obtain primogems per achievementthe spiral abyss is genshins endgame challenge mode and it awards primogems if you can clear all the enemies within a certain amount of time the rewards for floors are only obtainable once the rewards for floors reset on the and of every month this challenge mode is a hard dps check and casual players will struggle to clear all floors come prepared with a strategy and a wellbuilt team for each floor you can obtain a onetime total of fates for clearing the permanent floors and fates every month by clearing levels time the developers announce major game updates on their official twitch or youtube livestream they provide viewers with free primogem codes to redeem them go to settings then account and then redeem code these codes are valid for a day so be sure to activate them as soon as possiblewhenever you wish on a banner you get a small amount of stardust or starglitter currency every month you can buy up to five acquaint fates and five intertwined fates from the starglitter shop theres no limit to how many fates you can buy from the stardust shop but i would advise you to spend carefully despite the similar names stardust is harder to obtain than starglittertheres a white tree located near the entrance of dragonspine which is the wintery region near mondstadt the tree rewards you with items such as fates whenever you turn in enough crimson agates which can be found around dragonspine once you reach offering level you can take on weekly quests to earn agates you can get up to four acquaint fates and two intertwined fates from the treelogin events are extremely rare usually around twice a year theres always one during the lantern rite festival lunar new year but theyre otherwise unpredictable fortunately all you need to do is click on your daily login rewards in the events menu for seven nonconsecutive days a total of intertwined fates can be obtained per login eventthe battle pass is a meter that tracks how many tasks youve finished every season a season is roughly five weeks you can obtain up to five acquaint fates every season if you dont pay for the bpyou can obtain up to three acquaint fates for leveling each character that you have an acquaint fate is awarded at level and from major seasonal events theres no fast and easy way to obtain piles of wishes for free but if you log in regularly and attempt the challenges you can build up a respectable stash of fates by the time that your favorite character becomes available again remember playing genshin impact is not a sprint but a light jog that applies to obtaining the rarest characters too,en,422.0,Positive

i kid truthfully ive been avoiding writing this postthe one that acknowledges im back and also im in charge now at first this was easy being hired two weeks before meant i had little time to do anything but plan for the show but now its weird to keep publishing stuff without announcing myself more officially so here i am and this is itits a scary proposition to write this post because it means laying out my vision for the site and writing it down like this means that you know what it is that i want to do but more crucially get to judge if im living up to the standards that i set out thats terrifying because what i want for kotaku isnt just ambitious of course i want more readers of course i want to publish fearless writing criticism and reporting and of course i want to foster a community where everyone feels welcome somehow thats the easy partmany of these things are a continuation of what kotaku is already known forbut also i want to dismantle and redefine what a video game website can be i do not like what i see where to even begini hate that nearly every websites day to day is predicated on the release schedule and news cycle set by publishers i hate the coverage cycle of bigbudget video games and how a game is never more important than when it doesnt exist yetor when it just launched i hate that so much of what video game websites consider worthy of coverage is often written for a specific type of presumed reader it does not matter if a website is considered progressive it says everything that when writing about certain issues video game websites often have to take care in explaining basicass concepts like racism is realat some point having to explain power dynamics over and over again is not a question of informing the readership it is a tacit acknowledgement that our audience likely has a specific background and consequently that reality means that even as we cover more mainstream subjects or marginalized identities the writing is not truly for that wider audience this haunts me the presumed reader looks or sounds nothing like me and yet here i am leading a video game siteplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingits not a matter of being woke it is a matter of survival video game websites as they exist now repeatedly fail to represent the wide swath of people who play games and every year that passes this failure becomes more and more evident everyone plays games now yet most of these people hardly frequent video game websites unless they need to know how to do somethingand if we do reach this mythical mainstream gamer its likely because google willed itnot because weve cultivated that dedicated readership since social media websites throttle who can or cannot see our work we spend our time worshipping the fickle seo gods your favorite game website is likely quietly bankrolled by guides and service writers who try to predict what people will search next not news writers critics or reviewers playing that traffic game and being good at it of course is only a temporary salve yesterday it was facebook today its google tomorrow who knowshilariously gaming websites fail the capital g gamer repeatedly too the perpetual focus on whats coming next is not compatible with the idea that we are here to cut through the hype dont preorder games we say while dutifully covering the big event that exists to get you excited about the next big thing meanwhile advances like xbox game pass destroy the release cycle modern gaming websites have relied on for years whats new and shiny has no bearing on what will actually take off with the public as evidenced by among usnew in and of itself might be an outdated concept in the age of remakes remasters and rereleases across generations the last two years have had a dearth of showstopping game releases between coronavirus and a new console generation yet at the same time there are more games than ever old releases not new games perennially top the gaming charts of late im beginning to think my future grandchildren might still have to play the same ducttaped version of gta online that i haveits tough to wrangle all of this but its not like websites dont try here at kotaku we have this concept of embedding within games best described as an effort to continue covering games as they evolve and grow when i was at polygon we called these living games but the same basic idea applies games get updates audiences change we try our best to reflect that on the page as it actually exists not as pr saysbut video game websites as they exist now cannot truly keep up with our subject matter games are now designed to take up as much of your time as possible sometimes even punishing you for not logging in daily being up to date on certain big games is a job unto its own only achievable if you focus solely on that title aloneor at least only a few of them but the mandate of a video game website is to cover widely we have to make choices about which games we dig into and which games we cover more casuallyall of this has to be balanced with publishing daily multiple times a day these pieces also require time to research and report doing this job well often means sacrificing free time even as video game outlets try to provide writers with better conditions like having game time during work hours most people who do this for a living clock out and then log in to whatever theyre covering next when the perfect game is one that gives you dozens of hours of playtime there just arent enough hours to stay abreast of everything thats out there not if you want to produce thoughtful writing anywayburnout is endemic which is ironic when you consider the ongoing push to highlight crunch conditions at studios but because playing video games does not really seem like work its not something reporters can talk about freely without sounding like assholes woe is us its a tragedy that we have to sacrifice a weekend to properly cover that big game that isnt available to the public yet what is there to complain about when we probably got that game for freevying for relevance versus dwindling time is sometimes only the start writers especially those with marginalized identities often have to grapple with nonstop anger anger over suggesting that video games reflect the real world in any way shape or form anger that we get paid to do something many people would gladly do for free anger stoked by influencers who need you to believe game journalists are awful and they alone have your interests at heart anger fueled by four years of constant propaganda that mainstream media is fake news and not to be trusted anger that the news we report sometimes doesnt present video games and its communities in a positive light to the wider publici do not think this latent yet ongoing anger comes from the majority of our intended or presumed audience really its likely not even statistically significant compared to the millions of readers who read our work daily and love what we do but harm does not require an army all it takes is one asshole going out of their way to ensure a writer sees their bigoted screed theres always at least onei do not want to tell my writers to grow thicker skin though inevitably they do i want the world to be a kinder place it shouldnt require bravery to write about fucking video gamesbut what im getting at here is that i am terrified about my tenure at kotaku because i am an idealist realistically a lot of what i just described cannot possibly be changed by a single person or even a team of people by printing this i am opening myself up to criticism every time i dont change all the larger forces governing this work i havent even touched on institutional struggles here but they arent a secret to anyone who has read any go media sites over the last few yearsfailure seems inevitable but i am the sort of cursed person who cannot shoot for anything less than changing the way the game is played what would that even look like anywayi want kotaku to reflect things that are real i want to print stories that youd be able to tell a friend about at a bar even if they dont play games the way that we talk about games on the site should be the same way that wed talk about it in an actual conversation i do not care if the language or attitude at kotaku appears proper and respectable fuck that games are human and so are we any time there is a discrepancy between what we actually think and what lives on the page is when we betray not only our readers but ourselvesi want to move away from treating gaming like a product or industry instead examining them more as microcosms for the human condition games are worlds unto their own often developing not only customs traditions and dedicated languages but also their own vectors of power and influenceyeah the biggest youtuber in the world started out playing video games and sure pokmon go took over the outside world for a summer a few years back the largest entertainment properties on earth are created using game engines and nearly everyone has a device that plays games now the list of reasons why games matter is long and if youre reading this chances are good that you know much of this already i probably dont need to give you the whole spiel about how games are worth billions and are technically larger than businesses like the movie industryi mention these accomplishments not to prove gaming is worth taking seriously but to take that thought one step further if games are indeed as important as we say they are then we should feel comfortable enough to hold them to a higher standard if we truly respect this space we should be able to challenge the video game industry its products and the communities surrounding it if we want the world to stop treating games like mere toys we also have to stop treating video games like a wilting flower that must be protected at all coststhe challenge for a gaming website like kotaku is finding the right balance in coverage much of what i just described is the basic mandate of any good news organization nothing but the truth is treated as sacred the harder sell is that a website can do all of that while also retaining a sense of humor games matter but also games are silly and weird because humans are silly and weird stating the truth is not just about reserving space for heady topics its giving ourselves permission to have some fun on the pagesome of what ive outlined is a continuation of the approach started by my predecessor stephen totilo but i dont want just more kotaku with a different stable of writers and editors why bother the future of kotaku to me spans beyond video games games will always be the driving force but id like to think that what unites us isnt our willingness to hold a controller nerds are defined by fandom and an insatiable curiosity for how things work sometimes that drive and obsession unfolds in video games but not alwaysto properly showcase video game culture its necessary to talk about our digital lives more broadly we live in a world where your exercise bike has a leaderboard and language apps have daily challenges maintaining anyones attention now necessitates treating platforms their algorithms and their functions like systems that can be gamed and won games provide a crucial framework for parsing modern life and kotaku will now be an attempt to capture thati believe a different type of video game site is possible i hope you want to believe in that too,en,378.0,Positive

smidge of drakengard and neon genesis evangelion in the game this feels more spread out over hours but in its twohour demo it felt like rapidfire callbacks while on paper drawing from these iconic

armageddon but its final boss comes out of left field basically the government organization in mutationem is seele from ngewith all the convoluted reasoning and imagery that impliesand theyre using alternatedimension tech to do something and must harness anns power to pull it off while the games been hyping you to fight anns alt dimension self amok you merely fight a dragon i felt robbed of an epic battle with the rival character i assumed the game was preparing me for and insulted by the blatant sequel baitthe gameplay ultimately disappoints too being the unapologetic devil may cry devotee i am games rewarding skillbased combat with gratifying feedback is a must while mutationems combat hints at being dmcs pixelart equivalent it proves to be a mixed bag of hype visuals and underwhelming grind the games combat systems promise a depth that never plays out in gameplay while mutationem allows you to customize deconstruct and forge more powerful weapons with elemental mods and unlockable weapon skills many of these cool bits only materialize near the games finale while you can access some of these abilities earlier through sidequests the game doesnt do a good job of letting you know seemingly railroading you into its convoluted main plotafter a couple hours fights dont really feel rewarding simply put enemies are damage sponges once you finally break an enemys shield which works as their second health bar you have a matter of seconds to wail on them to do some actual damage before their shields recover the rest is wash and repeatone simple answer to this conundrum would be to parry enemies more frequently resulting in big damage boosts but the rewards for doing so are negligible and your foes have confusing hitboxes if you miss a parry thats a chunk of your health gone for the attempt i had to go out of my way to parry bosses by lining up with their hits instead of letting them come organically instead of trusting the game to make my parries count i developed the instinct to dodge roll constantly because it was the only safe and assured method for maintaining anns health and dealing damagewhile early boss fights are unique mutationems latter half pulls a halo by throwing multiple versions of the same boss at you sometimes fielding two more directly after you prime the first for a finishing blow boss fights increasingly felt like wars of attrition rather than the fastpaced battles of skill the game advertiseshave neko car will travelthinkingstarssidescrolling actionrpgplaystation playstation pcgorgeous pixel art wacky npcs and the endearing dynamic between the games main character and sidekickmarch story underdeveloped villains lore dumping and lackluster hours many of which were fighting frustrating boss battlesoutside of combat mutationem suffers from the same cognitive dissonance as the yakuza series with its sidequests and main missions feeling like two separate games while mutationems main quest comes off like an aigenerated anime scifi plot its sidequests unabashedly tell wacky and heartfelt stories that characterize the people who inhabit its world much of my enjoyment with mutationem came from straying from its main quest avoiding paths or hallways that looked like progress led me to discover bizarre npcs who all had written dialogue and receive snippets of their experiences in mutationems dystopian cyberpunk societymy favorite interactions came from running into a sewerdwelling man with a manhole cover for a face discovering the secret identity of a virtual pop idol and witnessing the final moments of a robot reaching enlightenment in the sewers these brief encounters left longlasting impressions making its underutilization of these fresher concepts within its larger story all the more frustrating instead of reveling in rich storytelling i was collecting a tally of how many plot elements from other media with which mutationem garnished its storyto make matters worse the game introduces cookiecutter villains who suffer from the annoying trope of being vague about their intentions instead of simply telling you just what the fuck is happening and what they want out of ann they simply say theyll see her again in the worst archetypical anime villain style these guys even look identical aesthetically sometimes even mirroring allies while the games latter half attempts to curb this by introducing villains with bizarre new looks these intricately designed doublecrossers writing is just as flat as that of their predecessors aside from the two leads the main cast is boring and unimaginative leaving the incidental environmental npcs to breathe life into mutationems worldstorytelling and combat aside two high points come in the games impressive art direction and the winning dynamic between its main characters the stunning visuals of mutationems setpieces almost supersede the imagery of the media its homaging ann and ayane are also really cute their banter in between main quest and sidequest content was worth the many brutal deaths and consequent eruptions of cmon man i yelled when barely photofinishing enemiesas thinkingstars first game anno mutationem boldly swings for the fences by throwing every cool concept it has at players mutationems unbalanced focus in its story is its critical failure at one moment its an animeinfused cyberpunk openworld rpg in the next its a rigid storydriven metroidvania but when it tries to meet in the middle its pacing screeches to a halt depriving its latter half of the charm of its wacky worldbuilding npcs and replacing it with long stretches of exposition conveyed through dry codexes and vague anime archetypes sporting unclear motivationswith the games ending hinting at a possible sequel mutationem stands as a messy first draft if a followup does come i hope thinkingstars will have the confidence to boldly stand and tell its own unique story rather than remain so shackled to its inspirations,en,445.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/the-best-dreamcast-games-1835926847#replies,The Best Dreamcast Games,heres a terrifying fact sega has been out of the console business longer than they were in it and while it was the dreamcast that finally did the struggling giant in for a platform that was only around for a couple of years it certainly left one hell of a legacy behindyoud think a console that failed in would have been long forgotten by but many of the dreamcasts biggest and best games are still making their mark on video games today from soulcalibur to shenmuealso worth remembering it had the single greatest console startup routine of all time like molten gold dripping under pale moonlight into a fine marble basinin honour of segas fallen hero weve put together this list of the best games for the dreamcast for those who might be interested in circling around and picking one up or those who once did and would like a tragic trip down memory lanethis unranked list has been made based on a couple of core considerations firstly and most obviously most of these are the games we simply think are the best dreamcast games those that are our personal favourites but there are also games here after two decades of space and time to consider that we think defined the dreamcast experiencei know i said this list was unranked but i lied jet set radio was the best dreamcast game i know it had its flaws regarding difficulty and the time limits some of which were addressed in the later xbox port but the colours the music the stylethis is the millennium distilled the perfect standard bearer for everything beautiful and good about the sega dreamcast if you could only ever own one game for this system it shouldwould be thisnobody knew it at the time but was one of the most important sports video games ever made back when the dreamcast launched ea sports decided they didnt want to release games for the system which meant no madden no problem sega figured so they went out and bought developer visual concepts who not only went on to seriously challenge madden in the football space through the but are now killing ea in basketball with their series was their second football effort on the console and wasnt just a better sports game than the first but it also had online multiplayer something that wouldnt catch on with rival platforms for yearsoriginally an arcade game ikarugas first ever home port was on the dreamcast where it was released only in japan that didnt stop westerners from importing it in droves and what theyd find was one of the smartest and prettiest shmups ever made the colourflipping mechanic at the heart of the game is such a simple idea but even two decades later its just still so perfectan expensive and beloved project way ahead of its time that bombed commercially leaving a flaming wreck and a beautiful legacy in its wake we could be talking about the dreamcast itself or we could be talking just about shenmueits heavy emphasis on story and revolutionary if also frustratingly basic way of implementing it in a video game earned it a ton of praise at release but also a ton of indifference from a market that just wasnt ready or lets be honest just didnt care for its quirksthere had never been and has never been another fighting game series quite like power stone where most other fighters are comfortable existing in abstract spaces the power stone games tried to replicate a proper space for their arenas including differing heights and destructible objects both were a blast but power stone was the better game also that old capcom character design is just to die forlike jet set and space channel and many other dreamcast games rez is a game that youve probably played somewhere else but whats important is that it was originally developed with segas console in mind it was and remains a nearperfect synaesthetic experience especially if played with its nutso vibrator peripheralthe trance vibrator came out on january packaged with special versions of rez for the jet set radio was most millennial video game space channel might run a very close second its mere existence is testament to how weird and daring the dreamcasts library could be where a company could actually take a janetmichael jackson music video and turn it into a rhythm game then expect more than three people to buy itseaman a piece of software that involved talking into a microphone at a fish with a human face that of yoot saito the games creator has not aged particularly well but just picture the process involved in getting this from high as fuck to boardroom pitch to actual game development to sure ok get leonard nimoy to do the voice and treasure every step of ittheres a common and persistent belief that the sonic games suck but to buy into that theory requires ignoring sonic adventure the bestselling dreamcast game of all time it looked amazing and while actually controlling sonic wasnt as elegant as in later sonic games would continue to struggle withfor this thing was one hell of an achievement it might even have been the killer app the dreamcast had so sorely needed ifthe console hadnt been killed only months after sonic adventures releasetheres nothing more sega than blue skies and theres no game with bluer skies than one literally set amongst blue sega skies a massive jrpg with an incredible for the time overworld its not hard imagining this appearing on any other console and selling millionsthis series still running in needs no introduction so i dont have to give one here instead im just going to say that the original dreamcast version of soulcalibur is still very very good and that ive been writing about video games professionally for years now and still type it out every single time as soul calibursamba de amigo married married rhythm action with a bonkers set of plastic maracas how they worked and how they were set up was as as it getsin the dreamcast version each maraca has a cord which is plugged into a bar that lies in front of the players feet the bar is slightly more than two feet in length and has a sensor at each end and each maraca has an ultrasonic transmitter mounted on its cord this allows the system to triangulate the position of each maraca the rattle part can be unscrewed from the top of each maraca for quieter included in the box is a plastic mat with two brown footprints which helps players properly position themselves in relation to the sensor barmarvel vs capcom dreamcast was home to a lot of great fighting games so many that three of them have made this list unlike the other two which looked into the future and saw three dimensions this ones for the purists as had a roster for the ages as well as some of the best pixel art to ever grace a fighting gameyet another example of sega leveraging its coinop success crazy taxi appeared on the dreamcast in a year after its arcade debut its fundamental designracing around a city while a giant arrow told you where to gowas so good that sega had it patented and would later take ea and fox to court over simpsons road rage because of itthis story was originally published in bests are kotakus

a nintendo switch lucky you or maybe you got one for someone else and want to help them make the most of it how kind in either case here are some good things to know after you open up everyones favorite portable hybrid consolewhile the switch is pretty easy to set up and straightforward to use there are some tricks that will make the whole experience even better from increasing battery life to saving time clicking through the eshop im going to assume that if youre reading this youve already gone through the initial process of booting your switch up making a user profile and connecting it to a nintendo account if you havent go do that if you have then do these things nextno matter how careful or delicate you think you are you will nick the screen i promise you you might knock it over by accident at one point maybe you have a cat who will swat at it and if nothing else you will probably move it in and out of the dock a few times during its lifespan which can also scuff up the display you can avoid lasting consequences to each of these incidents by purchasing a screen protector hori makes an economical but effective plastic one there are a bunch of other options as well carrying cases are a nice way to provide some added protection as welleven if youre the only person who will be playing your new switch do yourself a favor and make an extra user profile bonus points if you set its region to japan some games only allow one save file per account having an easily accessible alternative will give you more options and if its set to japan it will unlock additional games and demos that havent made it to north america yet including some in switch onlines subscriptionbased retro libraryplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingunless you love accosting your eyeballs go into the settings menu and turn off the bright white background it will be more soothing and also cut down on unnecessary battery usagethis ones another nobrainer unless you are sitting on the beach odds are you dont need your switchs display projecting at full strength if youre in a dark room turn the brightness all the way down the autobrightness setting works well for everywhere elsethis is the third tip related to battery life which should tell you how important it is to maximize the limited juice your handheld has access to want to play the legend of zelda breath of the wild in the park like that guy in the commercial turn on airplane mode to disable unnecessary features like wifi and bluetooth itll prolong battery life and is easy to toggle back and forth at a moments notice from the settings menuthe switch will make you type in your password every time you just want to log onto the eshop unless you disable it to do that open the eshop select your profile icon on the top right click through to your account information and update the passwordentry settingsthe switchs library of freetoplay games isnt as deep as some platforms but theres still plenty you can get your hands on and start enjoying right away without spending a cent here are the top three recommendations in that departmentthere are some other decent options as well including the platform fighter brawlhalla alternative battle royale shooter apex legends and hearthstoneesque card game eternalfree games are great but the switch has a lot of other great experiences to offer as well in addition to stellar firstparty games like mario kart deluxe and animal crossing new horizons its also been loaded up with ports of blockbusters and indie games alike as well as remasters and reissues of older nintendo games the great deals tab on the eshop menu will show you the biggest games that are on sale on any given day and the wishlist feature will let you keep tabs on stuff youre interested in and then alert you if and when it ever drops in priceonce youre ready to throw some bones nintendos way you cant go wrong with any of the games on kotakus switch bests list the lists of bestselling indie games on switch in recent years are also good places to startthe switch didnt launch with cloud saves but it has them now thanks to switch online unfortunately the paid subscription service will cost you a year but it might be worth it if you plan on investing a lot of time into offline games like breath of the wild or super mario odyssey in the months and years to come that way even if your switch is stolen breaks or otherwise becomes unsalvageable your save data wont meet a similar fatethe switch online expansion pack still isnt worth the extra but with dozens of the best nes and snes games ever released the base subscription tier is worth trying at the three months for entry point if and when you ever let your switch online subscription lapse youll have days to renew it before whatever saves you had stored in the cloud get deletednearly four years out the switchs social features remain critically underdeveloped but that doesnt mean they dont exist at all while theres no party chat youll need to rely on ingame chat features or discord you can still friend other players and see what theyve been playing theres even a trending section which will let you know if say your pals have all come down with a case of mario tennis fever nintendos console will let you link facebook and twitter accounts to quickly scour those platforms for mutuals who are also on switchthe joycon are very cute and come in all sorts of different colors unfortunately they also suck to play games with a clever way to get more gamepads into peoples hands for irl gaming sessions they may cause cramping in your hands after a while and will almost certainly start to experience drift malfunctioning at some point theyre fine in the beginning and serviceable enough in handheld mode but you will not regret upgrading to a switch pro controller you can also get an xbox series x controller my personal favorite to work with the switch by purchasing a cheap thirdparty dongle and if you want a cheaper more versatile option the pro is still excellent and only it go enjoy your switch now and if you decide to ignore all of this advice for the love of god please still put a screen protector on it,en,516.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/company-of-heroes-the-kotaku-review-1848020824#replies,,ive reviewed a lot of video game adaptations as part of my board game coverage for kotaku as youd expect since this is first and foremost a video game website some of those adaptations have been ok some have been pretty good but i havent played any quite like company of heroes beforesome of those decent adaptations like doom or fallout tried to replicate some of the themes and basic gameplay hooks of their digital counterparts while still clearly being their own distinct tabletop experiences you could play those games and think yeah this ends up getting to the same general spot as the video game does and i liked that video game so i like this toocompany of heroes the video game is one of the greatest pc strategy games ever made if youre reading this and arent familiar with it i wrote about a few years back in the most glowing terms possiblebetter adaptations like the assassins creed game i only just reviewed manage to go a bit further theyre able to transplant whole systems from the video game to the tabletop giving the board game the same overall vibes as the video game you dont like the board game just because you liked assassins creed but because you liked assassins creeds particular take on stealth and evasion which brotherhood of venice was able to so excellently replicatecompany of heroes somehow manages to go even further still this practically is the video game all of it every system every aspect everything you remember and love about the video game youll find it here only now youre playing it on a table instead of a pc it doesnt even matter that its now turnbased while the video game was realtime you get the exact same feelings only at a slightly slower paceits so close i dont even know if this counts as an adaptation anymore its almost a port though i say that with the utmost admiration for the designers at bad crow studios while the board game manages to stuff everything from relics release in here the ways theyve crammed it in are of course unique to the tabletop and so worthy of praisecompany of heroes ships with a few different ways to play ranging from standard skirmishes taking and holding victory points to hq assaults and with the coop expansion throws in the ability to add very smartlyhandled ai opponents and teammates to the mix theres no campaign but there are a few big maps you can mess around with which can be scaled and changed and even combined if youve got the space to provide different challengesthere are four factions players can choose from germany the ussr the usa and britain theyre all fairly interchangeable at least in terms of the quantity and mix of units and so arent locked to any particular side in the war you can pit the british against the americans or have the soviets team up with germany through the use of special powers and upgradeable hqs though each side largely follows the same basic themes as in the video game with the british geared towards the construction of emplacements while the americans are more focused on infantry gimmickslike ive said the brilliance here isnt in any kind of pioneering and innovative board game design since practically every system here is based on one already invented by relic back in but the team at bad crow deserve immense credit for the way theyve understood these mechanics and then found ways to adapt them to the tabletop a skill that cant be appreciated enough when it comes to these kind of games after all if it was so easy to turn a video game into a board game i wouldnt be getting so excited about the job this one has donejust because this feels like company of heroes at every turn doesnt mean it simply copies from the video game that would be crazy since the video game was realtime instead it takes every feeling you have from using every system on the pc and all the satisfaction you get from pulling off a sweeping tactical triumph and fills in the gaps elegantly giving us the same options and choices from upgrade paths to flanking opportunities but handing the execution of those off to dice and hexescover is here buildings that can be used to protect infantry but collapse under fire are also here as is suppression and the video games perfect rockpaperscissors balance between units and the way control points are captured and the way every battle starts with weaker squads then has to ramp up to bigger guns and tanksyou can plan and play a skirmish in this board game exactly the same way you would on the pc indeed the only area youd say theres a marked departure is combat since that could never be handled in realtime the same way but even here the board game does its best to make it feel realtime anywayat the point in every turn when its time to start shooting every unit thats in range of another gets to assign dice some of which will do automatic damage others which can be rolled with a chance of escaping the hits depending on the type of unit it is and the unit attacking it a simulation of the way the video game didnt let infantry attack a tank unless specially equipped for example it doesnt matter if its a battered infantry squad with one surviving rifleman or a tank fresh off the factory floor every units gets to trade blows and no unit can ever be wiped out without getting a chance to get a shot off of its own so while combat is resolved by players taking turns rolling dice the way its resolved still plays out as though those bullets and shells were exchanged in realtimecompany of heroes is a wonderfully tactile experience even at its smallest scale its still got thick huge boards to play on and the plastic miniatures you litter the battlefield with look fantastic from the smallest infantry squads through to the biggest tanks which can be painted and come with decals to apply if youre into modelling at all things get even better with the optional terrain pack which adds plastic buildings you can place infantry inon little plastic sandbags for cover and actual flagpoles with little flags that you get to swap every time a point changes handsbetween all the units and the board and the mountains of dice and tokens it has all the sensory appeal of a serious wargame with almost none of the hassle since company of heroes is definitely on the memoir side of the complexity scale the fun here is had in the broad brushstrokes of tactical engagement not its minutiae i know that looks like a lot of dice in these photos but here you have to imagine each one as an explosion rather than a set of complicated rulescompany of heroes is a game where youre always moving and seemingly always shooting where frontlines constantly bend but rarely break its a game where the whole war just gently ebbs and flows your plans always one step away from fruition but so too your opponents its such a delicious balance which the video game nailed and the board game getting it right as well goes a long way towards making it as enjoyable as it is to playbad crow studios deserve immense credit for what theyve accomplished here theyve neither invented or even reinvented the wheel but what theyve done is almost like a work of translation taking the design language of a successful video game and bringing the same joyif not through quite the same methodsto the tabletop i once said company of heroes was the perfect rts and i still mean it but company of heroes is now also a nearperfect tabletop game as well,en,536.0,Positive

https://kotaku,2022/05/04,https://kotaku.com/who-goes-there-the-kotaku-review-1846938074#replies,Who Goes There?: The Kotaku Review,youve seen the thing right well this is the board game adaptationvery serious fans of the movie will already know that of course since who goes there is the name of john w campbell jrs original novel that the film is based on but i just wanted to get that clear up top since a working knowledge of either is going to help going forwards herewho goes there the game bearing the books name but with loads of visual cues lifted straight from john carpenters movie was originally released in and was pretty wellreceived albeit with a few fairly common complaints it returned a couple of years later in with a second edition which like a video game in need of some postlaunch care sought to address some of the original versions issuesi never played that first edition so im not going to be able to compare it to this im not sure ill ever want to play it though since even this newer revised version has some glaring issues that i would have thought would be caught and ironed out in a rerelease and ill get to those laterso whats the game actually like its official summary does an excellent job of getting the gist acrosswho goes there is a cooperative game of growing paranoia at the beginning of the game all players are human and there is no reason not to trust each other completely but as the temperature drops and mistakes are made players start doubting everything and everyone around themyou must build trade and upgrade to prepare yourself for the antarctic terrain rabid dog attacks crazed madmenand most importantly the alien entity that is now loose in the camp everything you build and upgrade has one purposekeeping you alive and human during the entire game you will want to trade with other players and help each other build stronger weapons and better equipment while also passing food and med kits around although make sure your trust them since trade is a huge opportunity for the thingstaying inside may keep you from freezing to death but it wont help you or your fellow humans win the only way to secure victory is by venturing out of the camp the problem with that is being away from camp is the number one way to come across the thingleaving you vulnerable and exposed to infection whether fixing the boiler repairing the door or fighting the frigid temperatures outside you will all need one another to survive but trust is a hard thing to come by when you must be wary ofwho goes therebasically then its a game where everyone is working together and trusts each other to try and overcome a perilous situation until its not and becomes instead a game where everyone suspects everyone else is secretly a murderous alien lifeform disguised by freezing human fleshthe goal is for every player to try and survive a set number of rounds normally and then at the end of that get onboard a helicopter and get the hell out of there who wins though depends on who exactly gets onboard that chopper with human players trying to keep infected alien monsters off while anyone infected is trying to pretend theyre not infected and smiling and getting onto the helicopter alongside the humans like everything was totally fine theres then a bunch of depressing math and luck to work out the winner and im not going to talk about that yet because it gets me down and i want to talk about all the good stuff firsteverything up to who goes theres endgame which is really of your time with it is fantastic its a wonderful adaptation of the thing really nailing both the desperation of the source as survival becomes increasingly desperate as well as the mounting suspicion everyone is feeling as it becomes clear theres an alien potentially hiding under anyones skinconditions are so brutal that its often tough just surviving in the first place with dog attacks terrible weather and exploding boilers making each round more dangerous than the last throw in the fact you need to head outside all the time to get stuff you need for the helicopter escape and then be secretly monitoring and worrying about everyone else at the table at all times and things get pretty stressful the closer you get to the endthe whole thing is all very tense and the fact youre all having to work together while at the same time trying to not work togethercooperating is essential for survival but cooperating is also the easiest way to alien players to infect humansreally makes the experience feel like youre playing through the second half of the movie juggling survival with a descent into madnessits such an enormous shame then that when the end finally comes it sucks if players are able to survive until all turns are over a helicopter comes to rescue you and its time for the tableyou can play with players but you really want that to be make some hard decisions the group leader who throughout the game has determined the turn order can be voted out of their position if other players suspect theyre the thing and whoever ends up in the job is responsible for choosing who gets to go on the chopper and who stays behind to dieeverybody making it into the chopper then adds up how many helicopter points they picked up throughout the game by braving the weather and going outside and finally rolls a special dice to generate more helicopter points and sees if they beat a required points threshold required for victory theres a catch though if any infected made it into the chopper you have to deduct their points from the totalto win the humans need to beat that score requirement even if theylet the thing or multiple things onto the chopper with them and for the infected to win they need to have got at least one alien into the helicopter and see the humans not get the required scoreits an incredibly deflating way to end an otherwise great game for two reasons firstly its difficult getting an idea on who is infected simply through gameplay unlike other similar games like battlestar galactica so the vote at the end often felt like it was simply guessing rather than the result of any kind of longterm detective workand secondly a huge part of meeting your required points total comes from a dice roll i played this game twice and the first time the humans lost because an infected made it onto the chopper rolling a and i the human rolled a it hadnt mattered that over the past two hours id frozen my ass off getting three bonus helicopter points fighting off aliens and suffering frostbite because a single dice roll had negated the whole thingthis is bullshit taking such a significant part of the players agency out of their own hands at the end of hours of gaming sucks throw in the weirdness of being able to win despite letting aliens onto the chopper with you and the arbitrary nature of having to consult a flowchart to see if youd won or not and who goes there really does work overtime to slice any fun or satisfaction out of its endingi still think its a very cool coop survival game and the parts where everyone is working togetherwhich is the vast majority of your time spent at the table with who goes thereare really unique and enjoyable just know this a game for folks who are into the journey a lot more than the destination,en,523.0,Positive

propositioned for sex sexual harassment within their first day and even a game around the office where men would try to grope one anothers genitals these allegations havent been as widely reported as the litany of testimonials from harassed women but they also point to how systemic the issues were at the companythe announcement of the walkout is accompanied by a statement of intent letter addressed to activision blizzard management the letter states that employees believe their values are not being reflected by management and issues a series of demands meant to improve working conditions for those subjected to harassment and discrimination these demands include an end to mandatory arbitration which forces complaining employees into extralegal mediation rather than public

employeesi want to recognize and thank all those who have come forward in the past and in recent days i so appreciate your courage every voice matters and we will do a better job of listening now and in the futureour initial responses to the issues we face together and to your concerns were quite frankly tone deafthe cosby suite was more than just a nickname or a joke based on images and comments afrasiabi posted on his facebook supplied to kotaku by a former developer at blizzard it was reportedly a boozefilled meeting place where many including afrasiabi would pose with an actual portrait of bill cosby while smiling it was also a hot spot for informal networking at blizzcon three sources told kotaku where people looking to make inroads at the company would go to meet and hang out with some of its top designerswhile not everyone can attend the activision blizzard walkout for equality there are other ways to show support for the employees of the company as they demand improved working conditions for women and other marginalized groups in the wake of their employers inadequate response to californias sexual harassment and discrimination lawsuita new open letter signed by

entire video game industry axios reportswhen activision blizzard a company currently under fire for its discriminatory practices and rampant sexual harassment issues hires wilmerhale a law firm with a reputation for unionbusting heads turn and brows furrowa cybersecurity company whose security researcher had once been harassed by blizzard employees at a hacking conference charged the game developer a percent misogyny tax when it sought a quote for security services according to a new report from waypointbut whats notable here is that rather acknowledging that she as an executive employed in a leadership position at a company in turmoil had made a bad tweet and responded accordinglyby doing something like locking her account deleting the tweet or simply ignoring the criticism and getting on with whatever the rich do on the weekendshe began systematically blocking anyone even mildly critical of her decision to share a story about the perils of whistleblowing while her company is in the midst of historically shocking allegations brought on by employees testifying confidentiallyhonestly the sound of being booed by that many guys honestly in some ways that bothered me more than getting dismissed she said you had that initial cheer from the women in the crowd and then just wave boosbrack was one of only two people explicitly named in californias lawsuit which accused the now former

abk workers alliance the group also responsible for organizing last weeks walkout protest at blizzard headquarters in a statement sent to kotaku and yet the solutions you proposed in that letter did not meaningfully address our requests you ignored our call for an end to mandatory arbitration you did not commit to adopting inclusive recruitment and hiring practices you made no comment on pay transparencythe class action lawsuit claims that activision blizzard and its executives were aware of the companys issues of rampant sexual discrimination and workplace harassment during the periods these sox certifications were issued and knowingly left out that information the final sentence in the statement in particular reads false but has remained unchanged since appearing most recently in activision blizzards fiscal yearend report as the events of the past couple of weeks have proven ongoing claims and investigations have indeed had a material adverse effect on activision blizzards businessaccording to a new indepth report by axios several current and former activision blizzard employees either didnt trust hr to help them when they were harassed or were met with skepticism and pushback when they did try to report their issues to hrone of the things the hr rep commented on was that she was surprised i wasnt crying or i wasnt more hysterical one current employee told axios in regard to a time she alerted hr to being physically assaulted by a coworkerpr spin propaganda hypernormalisationwhatever you want to call it were collectively told over and over by people in power that what we witness and experience is bullshit and the bullshit they serve us back is whats actually true thats in part how a company with an increasingly documented history of not treating people rightbe it activision blizzard or amazoncom inccan say with a straight face that it really does care without being immediately laughed out of the roomthough some have renewed calls to boycott all activision blizzard products it remains far from clear whether thats something any developers at the company including the women most mistreated by it even support a boycott kotaku reached out to a number of current and former activision blizzard developers for their thoughts on how fans can best try to bring about change at the company some didnt respond others didnt want their comments to draw attention away from the abk workers alliances current list of demandsjesse mccree the namesake for overwatchs beloved cowboy fighter and most recently a designer on diablo was one of several current

its hooks into me within the first hour or i immediately bounce to something else ive never had any patience for this it gets good after ten hours nonsense a game either understands its own brilliance or it doesnt and only titles that fearlessly believed in their own vision had what it takes to earn a spot on my first annual personal top ten listfata morgana is the most creatively audacious visual novel that ive ever played usually im not a huge fan of media that utilizes violence for shock value i find them bland and creatively lazy this game is neither of those things fata morgana inflicts crushing amounts of unearned tragedy on its incredibly likeable characters just when i thought that the worst of it was over the situation would worsen to unbearable heights while i was playing i just wanted a nicer explanation for everything that happened thats how stories were supposed to work i thought you get past the gritty bits to be rewarded with crumbs of hope i kept waiting and wishing until it was clear that i would remain disappointed despite that i kept playing after a while i was fully prepared for the game to bring its worst after watching several tragedies unfold i was no longer dependent on being rewarded by the narrator and that changed everything about how i consume stories fata morgana is one of those games that forced me to reckon with my own role as a readerdont read the spoilers just play the gameplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingthis comicstyle platformer gave me what i really needed during a year when our government was constantly failing us a lovable vigilante who believes in oldschool justice i wrote a lot of words about the cultural context and why tianding is important as an art game but really its just fun to steal from the rich and lay the kung fu on some cops along the waywhile octopath has an immensely fun turnbased combat system this game earned a spot here mainly because i cant stop listening to its gorgeous soundtrack its soothing intensely haunting and kept me sane while i was trying to buy groceries during a global pandemic i really couldnt imagine making it through this year without octopathwhen i booted up tales of arise i was expecting a tales game but with more budget its absolutely that but its also a surprisingly ambitious story about revolution empire and shared struggle more importantly it just feels really damn cool to be slamming down finishing moves with my favorite party members ill be grinding in this game well into know i know i wrote a harsh review of it earlier in the year because i wanted neo to be just like its predecessor i wanted it to eviscerate me and lay my heart bare i resisted the notion that the game should just be allowed to be a feelgood jrpg for mainstream consumption after my initial disappointment i settled down and found myself enjoying the killer art style and banger soundtrack its a solid sequel that experiments with interesting partybased mechanics come for the story but stay for the most stylish video game location of someone wanted a quick and dirty explanation of wildermyth id tell them that its xcom for fantasy nerds the main difference is that it goes a lot harder on personal narratives for each of the individual characters than i would expect see wildermyth is mostly procedurally generated you can randomize your characters appearance gender sexuality and background their personal arcs are defined by random lifealtering events but the writers have authored so much loving detail that i sometimes forget that my characters are determined by a cold and unfeeling dice rollthese diceroll people are real to me thats all that really matters isnt itheres how most choices in video games are presented kill the npc or let them live tell someone a truth that will hurt them or lie save the few or the many in chicory theres only one important choice blue or orange dots or stripes bombastic colors or the serenity of pure white my character in chicory was given a paintbrush and asked to paint every part of the games levelspainting chicorys setting was a responsibility that allowed me to define the game world in a very tangible way but my decisions carried none of the usual choice paralysis everything i did was inherently correct everything was permanent until it wasnt chicory deserves a spot on this list solely for allowing me to affect the environment in ways that were personally meaningfuli want to save the world i want to leave my mark on it but i also dont want to make a bunch of mistakes and fuck it all up chicory is the answer to all of those impulses and its super satisfying toostarsong has the most impressive moodsetting and worldbuilding of any game that i played this year its galaxy feels both human and inhumane intimate and distant starsong wraps violence in soft colors and a gentle soundtrack but it never loses sight of the violent systems that have shaped every aspect of its characters factions and settingsraise your hand if you saw this coming thats right the game that i plug at least hours into every week has made my goty list and for good reason the updates have been reliably consistent the new features genuinely improve my enjoyment of the game and the fan content that comes out of this community is unparalleled im always looking forward to every major genshin patch and i suspect that next year wont be any differentive only finished three ace attorney games and i never planned to go any further than that but then a complete stranger practically begged me to play the great ace attorney chronicles sure i thought i could spare a few minutes here and there to solve some murders i started playing this game five days ago and ive been binging it nonstop every day sincegaac completely blew past my previous experiences with the series while its filled with the usual quirky jokes and outlandish personalities it also tells a surprisingly mature and nuanced story about class gender race and empire theres still the old emphasis on solving puzzles and presenting evidence after all the british legal system is modern and scientific yet chronicles is willing to sabotage its own gameplay to prove to the player that truth is inherently political i wasnt just piecing together the truth behind these grisly murders the game invited me to challenge the superiority of the british empireto say that chronicles is an ace attorney game would be selling it woefully short its an absolute mustplay for anyone whos interested in visual novels or detective fiction,en,585.0,Positive

unnecessary disruptions despite the widespread availability of vaccines the semiconductor shortage is whipping the economys ass black and queer people are still dying it was hard playing games this year especially when i didnt have a or xbox series xs until just a few weeks ago still i managed to distract myself with more games than i thought i actually played and while i havent beat every one here i found solace in some levity in most and enjoyment in them all here are my top games of studios is the master of firstperson immersive sims and deathloop is a testament to that a thrilling psychological tale about choices time and consequences deathloop builds on the excellence of dishonored and cranks the volume up to its brutal its fast but its also a delight especially as you unlock the various abilities and weapons plus there are twonot one twoblack playable characters here consider me soldplay skyrim again and againif you havent played skyrim at this point in your life im frankly impressed bethesdas rpg classic is difficult to avoid no matter where you go it feels like skyrim is there lurkingtitan souls developer acid nerves first project was a cool little boss rush game that felt a little incomplete to me when it came out in but i was intrigued by what the studio was doing and deaths door is the next logical step an isometric dungeoncrawler in which you control a crow who reaps souls deaths door is one of those games that expertly blends feel and mood it understands and executes its goal without overstaying its welcome it also has a dope boss fight that illustrates its elegant game design its no wonder deaths door appears on most of kotakus endoftheyear listsa shonen anime through and through pocket traps dodgeball academia is probably the most fun ive had with a video game all year long its an absurd charming little rpg about otto a student who leaves his lameass school against his parents wishes to join the collegiate at dodgeball academia a university of sorts for aspiring dodgeball players what you get is a sportscentric dodgeballemup replete with various power balls like electricity and homing special moves and side missions to complete it all gives way to a story about identity finding your true self and trusting your friends very naruto or one piece shit if were being honest and i love itnot going to lie i wasnt expecting to enjoy ateams final fantasy vii the first soldier as much as i have been and thats primarily because of the platform its on i mean its a mobile game the primary input method is the touchscreen while you cant get super accurate in this battle royale shooter because of that the first soldier is still a good way to kill some time especially if you missed fortnite on ios and because its a final fantasy game you can expect the usual accoutermentssummons gil materia costumes to dress your soldier up as iconic series characters and different playstyles ranging from the swordwielding warrior to a shurikenusing ninja there are even chocobo you can customize so whats there not to likeim a big fan of mobas having spent a good three or four years playing titan forge games smite when it launched in timi studio groups arena of valor was also in my moba rotation before getting upstaged by the developers pokmon unite its become my main moba now on account of both ip and approachability but more than that what pokmon unite has done is helped me find joy in mobas again i can be very competitive i get frustrated when i lose because others arent pulling their weight but pokmon unites diverse characters and fun events push me to see beyond the competition to enjoy both the aesthetic and gameplay without focusing solely on the score its a nice reprieve from the highintensity mobas elicit even though pokmon unite can get pretty intensethis is basically anime the video game developed by bandai namco studios and tose scarlet nexus piqued my interest when it was revealed in may and blew me away when i finished it sometime after its june release its a slick actionrpg with dual protagonists whose narratives are intimately connected prompting you to play through the game twice to see the story from both of their perspectives its an evocative emotional and exhilarating journey with tight controls and even tighter powers its fun but what i love most are the moments between playable characters kasane randall and yuito sumeragi as they come to understand their connection to each other and the events that unfold over the games hours scarlet nexus is brilliant and though it looks like a tales game its more than thatno list of mine would be complete without skateboarding making an appearance though its been available via apple arcade since agens games and studios skate city grinned onto consoles and pc this year without much fanfare thats understandable as it is pretty lowkey but everyones missing out on what amounts to a lofi version of eas skate skate city much like skate asks you to use the thumbsticks to chain tricks grinds and spins together to complete challenges while racking up points the lowpoly aesthetic coupled with the chillhop music make for a whole vibe and its a perfect game to fill some time honestly i cant put it downneowiz games skul the hero slayer is a cute roguelite actionplatformer but truthfully dont let its cuteness fool you this is a hardass game you play the eponymous skul a little skeleton warrior who can swap his head for that of another head which then transforms his entire body and grants him different abilities theres a grim reaper mage ninja werewolf and so many more to pick up that playing through and getting whooped in skul the hero slayer always presents another opportunity to discover a new playstyle thats the best part no two runs are the same and even if there are similarities between the two either in the form of familiar pathways or enemies in familiar spots you can switch it up by simply swapping headsmuch like scarlet nexus bandai namco studios tales of arise is also anime the video game those familiar with the tales formula know what to expect in this actionrpg but everythings been cranked up to the visuals are absolutely stunning the realtime gameplay is tight as all hell the characters are fascinating and deep but what really strikes me is the games story which is this interweaving narrative about class and liberation it packs so much meat onto its bones that while some of it can feel a little dry most of what tales of arise offers is both enticing and delectable im still in the beginning but im stoked to see more of what alphen and his eclectic party members get intowho knew a game with absolutely no dialogue could be so heartbreaking and yet witch beams unpacking is just that a storydriven puzzle game that follows an unnamed protagonist as they go through lifes various stagesearly adolescence college life first relationships and their fallout etceteraunpacking says so much about finding ourselves in and out of love without saying a single thing its a beautiful experience one held up by excellent environmental sound and visual design it also reminds us how much boyfriends can suck especially when they dont make space for you it might be short but unpacking will stick with you for a long time afterwith that i say goodbye to and all its bullshit most of it like the pandemic and semiconductor shortage will follow us for a while which sucks similarly a lot of these games will hit my neverending backlog as game lineup is looking mighty stacked still this was an excellent year for games and i cant wait to see what else is in store for next yearthanks for a dope first year dear kotaku readers see yall in ,en,633.0,Positive
