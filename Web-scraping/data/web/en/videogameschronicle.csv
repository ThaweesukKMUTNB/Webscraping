wants to work on a pay-to-win gameâ,vampire the masquerade bloodhunt a new freetoplay battle royale game set in the universe of the pen and paper rpg launches today after several months of early accessunlike the early launch which only arrived on pc this version comes to both pc and stylish and brutal battle royal players compete against other vampires in solo or trios mode in order to be the last vampire standing with the help of guns swords and anything else they can get their hands onahead of the launch we got the opportunity to sit down with the games director craig hubbard and bloodhunts producer david sirland to discuss the pitfalls of live games and where they see bloodhunt existing in the battle royale spacecraig hubbard a development veteran spent most of the working on the fear series as its creative director he also served as lead game designer on gotham city imposters a multiplayer title which saw teams of players dressed as iconic batman characters do battle in a stylised gothamwith both multiplayer and horror experience under his belt hes a perfect fit for this unconventional vampire royaledavid sirland joined sharkmob after working at dice on the battlefield series for over a decade serving as a multiplayer producer on battlefield v he left dice and the pvp traditional multiplayer space to helm bloodhunt beginning in has developing bloodhunt during the pandemic presented challengesdavid sirland i was at the office two days and then it hit and you know work from home mandates and all that sort of thing and that was interesting coming into a new team being the leader essentially of the team that took way longer than i would like it to have taken so that was an interesting challenge but it also comes with a lot of interesti got to know way more of the team more quickly than normal like the people who actually interact with you first physically by walking around are the people you know first and that tends to be the people that are very talkative and so on but now its more like were forced to interact with everyone and figure out what makes them tick and all that sort of thing so i feel thats the big thing here but anyway personally i think making a free to play multiplayer title which ive never done before is super interestinghow does working on a free to play title like bloodhunt compare to the other games youve worked on during your careercraig hubbard the the most fun experiences ive had in my career have been working on pvp games i think probably the most fun was a game called gotham city imposters which was sort of a similar situation where you take an ip that you dont really associate with pvp and you make a game out of it but that was half the fun pvp is just super fun to work on because its really fun to playyou play test every day you have the team incredibly invested because when you make a singleplayer game the team will play it kind of reluctantly and they wont give you much feedback but when theyre playing pvp like any little thing that gets them killed you hear about it so you get great feedback from the team great involvement and investment lots and lots of ideas its really really funds i think the biggest difference is that you have to consider the motivations of players more right because you essentially can get unlimited players to come in as long as your download client is small enough they will all try it but theyre also super disloyal because you know they didnt pay anything for it theyre not invested yetso you have to have a really good onboarding obviously you also need to function as good social glue which is what were going for were trying to make a game where someone that is the early adopter comes in and says this is a cool game i want my friends to come and then they play together that will be the ultimate goal here to have it grow through recommendation essentially or someone is pulling themhow are you going to grab players initiallyds i think initially obviously the game looks pretty stunning i think that draws a lot of attention it also is a very watchable game its fun to watch this game its fun to watch someone else play this game and then you want to try it then the actual core gameplay is good i think thats the key aspect here you need the game to be good and fun to play press buttons and things happen and its fun i think thats the coreand you know when we start iterating and adding things here its really key that thats the central and stays on point i heard a comment before that i played a lot of in early access and we played this build that were launching with the biggest difference here is not like blatantly obvious but this feels so much better and i feel like when i have a fight its fairer thats the best feedback i can get because that means our tiny tiny balance changes to how this core mechanic works paid offhow is the game monetisedch from the moment i came here it was already understood that it was going to be purely about cosmetics i dont think theres ever any consideration of pay to win sort of approach like that that kind of thing if you look at it purely from what works whats the best way to make money you can do that but nobody wants to work on paytowin frankly its very hard to recruit for that i mean it would make sense for a vampire game to be vampiric but its just not its unpleasantso i think from the beginning it was always understood that it was going to be optional cosmetic monetization you basically want to make content that people think is cool enough that they actually want to buy it and you also need to earn trust you need to make people feel like their money is going to somebody that they dont mind giving money to its like almost like theyre a patron in a waynobody wants to work on paytowin frankly its very hard to recruit for that i mean it would make sense for a vampire game to be vampiric but its just not its unpleasantds this game is not monetized through any sort of grey area gameplayish sort of way at all we said no to that because we want this game to be a game you can play competitively its not necessarily a competitive title but its competitive to where the last vampire standing essentially so you need to not have a way to sort of skip the line here which is where we said also fits pretty well with the whole masquerade and vampire styles and all of thatits all vanity there are two fantasies the gameplay fantasy and the vampire fantasy of being a vampire and what type of vampire you want to be are you a seductive one brutality focused one and then trying to figure out whats the next thing when it comes in you know in pop culture even whats the next cool thing to wear i guess and that will be how we monetise this gamethe game has more of a focus on narrative than many other games in the genre how do you make sure players that want that element of the game can be satisfied but also account for players that just want raw gameplayds absolutely i think thats super key i mean we need to be a platform for like this is an entertainment service essentially we need to be a platform for both those types and obviously one of them might end up like one group of players is larger than the other and so therefore there will be more features for that type of player over time but initially were trying to start sort of vanilla and be like have a great starting point where we have a bunch of scenarios where this could lead and which type of player prevails and what type of game this really becomes both of them have a placeobviously games like this need to have a roadmap of content in order to satisfy players but almost more importantly you need to be able to react to what the player base wants is the roadmap flexible in this sensech i think with the roadmap there are certain aspects of a game that take a lot of time to develop that you have to think about very well in advance i think especially anything involving content is just building it takes time so you have to anticipate that a bit but when it comes to features and then mechanics i think you want to be as reactive as possible to the community as people are playing the game and theyre starting to see its really when you play a game a bit you start to see those opportunities and the things that start to annoy youand if youve overplanned your roadmap you cant react to that stuff and see end up with a game that gradually loses the audiences interest so we really tried to say we have ideas of course we have lots of things we could do but weve really tried to keep our plans flexible as much as possibleds i mean thats sort of the core of it of a service game you cant have one road ma you need to have a bunch of scenarios that are likely or less likely but you need a bunch of them and then you start and theres a roadmap attached to each of those or an order of things at the very least like where you can swap things out and theyre sort of equal value and everything comes with a cost and a different result or impact on something elsefor instance one thing that tends to be true when youre doing updates or development is you have a feature update and then you have a content update and the reason for that is here are all your programmers they need to do this thing and its hard and it takes a lot of iterations i need to focus on that and heres all your content and artists and they need to do that and in between when they are doing they fix bugs that sort of thing tends to happen for instance and if you can do that at a smaller scale its all about finding those balancesso its a constant sort of reassessment and it can be quite stressful being part of the team if youre not communicative around whats happening and why either even internally and i feel like its really helpful that we can be as communicatively outwardsnotice to display this embed please allow the use of functional cookies in cookie preferenceshow has your work on previous games influenced your time on bloodhuntds i really liked this because this reminds me of when we did a test environment for a former battlefield title where essentially the big splinter community were invested because they wanted to and i think when you have a new game that comes out you get that from the getgo thats like the start of it you get the people that are really interested and theyre obviously more susceptible to be interacting with you and give you more of their time and all that sort of leads to a back and forth and a winwin situationi really felt like there was no baggage apart from the unconventional ip and i feel like weve sort of moved past that with the people that had qualms about is this really a game that fits this universe i mean either they just fully embraced us and love us now or youre there at least with us and like rooting for this to succeed because they realise the potential for more people to come into the universe and this is a great entry point to be interested in the rest of all the superrich stuff that is part of this worldch the plan for gotham city imposters was to make it a game as a service it was very early and there werent a lot of those examples yet in the west but i think when youre making a game like this its really fun to actually get to release a game and then to support it and a lot of times what used to happen is companies would put out a game and if it didnt turn into a megahit they would just abandon it and it would die and that you spend years working on a game and to see it just wither away because the people with the money dont want to invest in sustaining it until it can build an audienceits tragic but i think whats happened is the industry has seen that a lot of games that have become super big successes are coming out of the mod space or the indie space where the teams just stick with it and they build the community and they prove themselves and they involve people and then they grow something that now suddenly has mass appeal,en,540.0,Positive

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/switch-sports-review/#comments,Switch Sports Review in Progress: A bare bones experience without online,earlier this year it was revealed that the switch had overtaken the wii in terms of total sales making it the companys best selling home console everone of the driving factors behind wiis success was the global appeal of wii sports one of the most influential accessible and inclusive launch games for any consolewith switch sports its clear that nintendo is hoping to replicate that success for a new generation but at this exact moment we cant quite determine whether its managed to pull it off yetat the time of writing this review nintendo has still yet to turn on the online servers for switch sports meaning our time with the game has been offlineonlythis wouldnt necessarily have been an issue with previous wii sports games but because the offline component of switch sports is probably the least featurepacked of any game in the series we really do have to wait until we can test the online modes before we can deliver a definitive verdict on this onefor now we can at least take a look at the six sports on offer as localonly experiencesthe first is volleyball which can be played by players and is a strictly doubles affair the aim here is to get the timing right when performing the pass set and spike moves all of which are done by flicking the joycon if you can time two or three of them well itll increase the power of the spikeof the three netbased sports in the game this is the only one where you have some degree of control over your character if youre defending at the net you can move left and right before jumping up to try and block a spikevolleyball is one of the weaker sports in the game once you get the timing down right there isnt really much more to it and you dont really feel like you have much control over your spikebadminton fares a little better if only because theres a more obvious feeling that you have a degree of control over your strokes you have no control over your player in these matches and the only moves you really have available to you are lobs to the back of the court drop shots to the front and smashesplaying this one well involves mixing up lobs and drop shots in an attempt to make your opponent stumble which happens if you swing too early or late this opens them up for an easy smashalthough badmintons controls are generally satisfying there are occasions where you may need to quickly swing and the game doesnt pick it up well meaning you just dont swing at all and lose the point it can be a frustrating affair especially against the ai on the hardest difficulty like every sport in the compilation though things are obviously improved when youre playing against another humanbecause the offline component of switch sports is probably the least featurepacked of any game in the series we really do have to wait until we can test the online modes before we can deliver a definitive verdict on this onethe only real exception to this is the third sport bowling which is perfectly enjoyable as a solo affair it plays much the same as it did back in the wii days except now you dont let go of the trigger button to throw the ball presumably to avoid reports of accidentally thrown joyconsas well as the option to play a standard game theres also a mode called special which has three difficulty levels and places various hazards on the lane sometimes youll have to deal with bollards rising and falling sometimes there will be spinning barriers on the lane and sometimes the whole lane will have a large dip in itthis is a great mode and makes for some entertaining multiplayer games where a badlytimed throw can see even a skilled players ball hitting off an obstacle and landing in the gutternext up is tennis which is one of the main sports that kicked off the wii sports craze in the first place nintendo has adopted an if it aint broke dont fix it policy with this one so as was the case years ago matches are doublesonly and players cant control movement only their swingsit feels like it plays a little slower than the wii sports version but other than that its pretty much business as usual and anyone who got a kick out of the original back in the day will feel right at home with this new versionchambara is the fifth sport and is similar to the swordplay event in wii sports resort specifically the duel mode in that players can choose to use a single sword try out a special chargeable sword or dualwield two at once with the aim being to knock the opponent off a large platformin theory the idea is that swipes can be blocked by holding the sword perpendicular to the attack if your opponent tries a downward swipe then you can block it by holding the sword horizontally in practice though this is switch sports equivalent of the boxing game in wii sports in that strategy goes out the window right away with both players flailing around like maniacs until someone winsthe package is rounded off with football which is easily the biggest surprise and most entertaining sport at least for experienced video game players the shootout mode which uses the ring fit adventure leg strap is fairly throwaway the main event here is the fantastic mode which locally can only be played by players with ai bots making up the rest of the numbersas it stands with no online the game is woefully lacking in features volleyball and badminton are the first to five points and thats it tennis is one three or five games like it was in wii sportsin our previous handson preview we said our initial reaction to football was that its basically rocket league on foot and having spent much longer with it we can confirm thats absolutely the case its a giant floaty ball in an arena with walls and a huge exploding goal where massive midair strikes are the order of the day its rocket leagueit does take some getting used to however because shots arent performed by simply ploughing into the ball but by swinging the joycon with the direction of the swing determining where it goesit soon becomes clear that this isnt exactly the most accurate way of doing things but it does add a bit of anarchy of proceedings when apparent open goals arent always a done deal we cant wait to try football out online with a full eightplayer game and thats exactly why our review of switch sports is incompleteas it stands with no online the game is woefully lacking in features volleyball and badminton are the first to five points and thats it tennis is one three or five games like it was in wii sportsits even more lacking for solo players wii sports had a progression system in which ai opponents got increasingly more difficult as players got better at each sport that isnt available here you choose one of three difficulties and thats itit doesnt even have the fun training minigames that were on the wii where you could practice your tennis skills by trying to hit targets or try to bowl over a massive pins with one throw there are no medals to earn no special achievements to unlock nothing like that just six sports in barebones fashionthats not to say there isnt some sort of progress to be made here it just appears to all be online your character can technically be customised but theres only one outfit to choose from in a variety of colours there are separate menus for hats glasses and what appears to be facemasks but theyre all empty as far as we can tell these are all unlocked by playing onlineif you werent planning to play switch sports online you may want to slap a threestar rating on this or maybe even two if youre playing alone and football doesnt appeal its slightly absurd that offline at least the game offers even less than the original wii sports did and wii sports resort the best in the series blows it out of the waterits clear however that the online play at least promises some degree of progression and variety for that reason were holding fire until we can see how much depth there is online before delivering our final verdictat this stage switch sports feels like an unambitious retread of a game with very little in the way of options all eyes are now on the online modes when they go up to see if they breathe new life into it,en,551.0,Positive

constant debate in certain gaming circlesthe switch online service provides players with access to an instant library of nes and snes games but many still argue that they would rather have a larger library of classic games that they can buy individually as with the virtual console service on the wii wii u and some may not realise is that the switch actually has over retro games in its library already meaning players with a soft spot for the good old days already have healthy access to a host of titlesthis article is designed to help you unleash your switchs potential as a retro gaming system by detailing the various ways you can access older titles on the consolenote there are countless debates over what counts as retro for the sake of this article were counting everything from the

to date nesfamicom gamesthe most obvious place to start with switchs classic games library is the aforementioned switch online which is primarily designed to be a subscription service for switch owners who want to play online but also provides a host of retro games as part of its subscription feethe nes service launched in september with games available on day one and over time this has grown to nearly titlesnaturally all of the firstparty classics are on there all three games in the super mario bros series plus the japanese super mario bros both legend of zelda games and the donkey kong trilogy are on there as well as the likes of kid icarus metroid punchout kirbys adventure and balloon fightthere are also some impressive thirdparty games included such as double dragon i and ii ghosts n goblins tecmo bowl gradius blaster master and ninja gaidenwhile the selection may initially seem a little random the games chosen are generally entertaining and the majority remain playable todaya lot of games from the nes era have aged drastically and struggle to hold up to todays standards but most of the games included here are at the very least responsive enough to entertainone thing they dont have though is the tutorial sections that have become the norm in modern gaming and as such many of them can be a little hard to get into to to combat this nintendo has also included optional sp versions of some of the trickier gamesthe sp version of the legend of zelda for example starts link off with a bunch of gear and rupees already in his inventoryanother thing to bear in mind is that if you have access to the japanese nintendo eshop you can also download the free famicom version of the appthis app simply looks for a valid switch online subscription regardless of region so if you play the app with your local account youll get access to the japanese library insteadthis includes some extra titles that arent available on the western version of the app including hal laboratorys adventures of lolo the sequel to clu clu land konamis yie ar kung fu and sunsofts fun racing maze game turbosince the japanese app uses the famicom versions of games instead of the nes ones there are also some slight differencesthe famicoms additional sound channels mean the likes of the legend of zelda and kid icarus which are based on the famicom disk system versions have better music in the japanese app and super mario bros is more difficult than it is in the west because if you get hit while wearing a suit you instantly become small mario instead of transforming back to super mariototal to date snes super famicom gamesthe addition of the nes library was received well enough that the following year nintendo did the same with the super nintendolaunching in september the snes app also started out with titles a list which has now grown to nearly the snes was a console as opposed to the nes many would argue that most of its games are more approachable to modern players who may be discovering them for the first timemuch like the nes library there are some timeless classics in here many of which are firstparty gold mario fans get super mario world super mario kart super mario allstars and yoshis island as well as the brilliant marios super picross which was only released in japanmeanwhile the likes of the legend of zelda a link to the past super metroid and the donkey kong country trilogy are similarly fantastic as are star fox kirby super star stunt race fx and pilotwings you even get star fox the unreleased snes game that was previously only available in the snes miniin terms of thirdparty games most of the best additions come courtesy of capcom the breath of fire rpgs demons crest and super ghouls n ghosts are all brilliant titles that are well worth trying outthe japanese eshop trick works here too meaning you can also access the super famicom version of the app this gives you access to a few new games though most of these like fire emblem mystery of the emblem and shin megami tensei i and ii are practically unplayable if you dont speak the language you do get quirky fighting game sugoi hebereke thoughin all while there are currently fewer snes games than nes ones the quality is generally higher making it arguably the best source of cheap retro gaming on the switchtotal to date arcade gamestokyobased hamster corporation launched its arcade archives series on the in and has since brought it to other series including the switch clu clu land donkey kong donkey kong jr donkey kong excitebike golf ice climber mario bros pinball punchout sky skipper soccer super punchout urban champion vs balloon fight vs baseball vs mahjong vs super mario bros vs tennis vs wrecking crewthe company specialises in releasing individual arcade titles at an affordable price usually each while the sheer number of games released to date means it would cost a small fortune to buy them all the idea here is similar to the virtual console where players can choose which specific games they want to ownthe arcade archives collection spans the entire and early and covers releases from the likes of konami frogger track field sunset riders taito bubble bobble elevator action darius and technos double dragon renegade super dodge balleach game offers the standard game as well as a hi score mode where you have to score as much as you can with a single credit and a caravan mode where youre given or minutes depending on the game and have to score as highly as possible both modes have online leaderboardsby far the most interesting thing about arcade archives on the switch is that hamster was given permission to release a number of nintendo arcade games there are nintendo arcade games on here none of which were ever made available to buy in the pastthese include the arcade versions of the donkey kong games the twinscreened punchout and super punchout and the extra difficult vs super mario brosby far the most exciting release for historians though is sky skipper after an initially poor reception nintendo scrapped the game and turned its cabinets into popeye ones theres only one cabinet left in the world in nintendo of americas archives and only four known copies of the arcade board nintendos own board was used for the arcade archives release making it the first chance to officially own and play nintendos lost gametotal arcade neo geo gamesone company dominated the arcade scene like no other throughout the and that was snk with its neo geo systemthe neo geo hardware came in two forms the mvs and the aes the mvs was an arcade board that supported special cartridges meaning arcade owners could swap in and out games without having to buy new cabinets or expensive upgrade kitsthe aes meanwhile was a home console that was just as powerful as the arcade version meaning players could play arcadeperfect versions of the games at home this came at a price though the console was about adjusted for inflation and the games were eachaca neo geo is a spinoff of hamsters arcade archives series that deals solely with neo geo mvs and aes games each game is emulated perfectly and comes with the same hi score mode and caravan mode you get in the arcade archive releasesthere are a little more than of these games available to buy separately on the eshop for each and while once again it could be argued that this adds up if you buy a bunch of them were sure if you told neo geo owners in that one day those games would cost less eight bucks each theyd be stunnedtotal arcade mega drive and master system games across

the numerous multigame compilations available on the switchthere have been more than of these released for the system to date each containing a readymade batch of games sometimes with extra features like behindthescenes galleries or remastered versionsfor the very best examples we recommend the street fighter anniversary collection the snk anniversary collection and konamis anniversary collections but naturally if you have an interest in any of the games or series listed below you should check out their respective compilationsheres a list of compilations available to date note when it comes to counting the total number of retro games available on the switch were only counting games from the era and earlier in super mario allstars for example we arent counting super mario galaxy in our totaltotal individual rereleases or remastersa number of retro games have also seen separate releases on the switch either physically or on the eshopthe majority of these come in the form of remastered editions which take the original game and upscale or recreate the visuals to make them more suitable for modern displaystheres a grey area around whether these can truly be considered retro titles since it could be argued that they arent authentic representations of the original gamesfor the sake of this article well count them but were only counting remasters rather than remakes as such the likes of oddworld new n tasty pokmon mystery dungeon rescue team dx and panzer dragoon remake havent been included in our list because theyre essentially new games designed to play like the originals rather than modern presentations of the originalsthe individually released retrothemed games on the switch eshop includein all weve counted games above if you include individual games in compilations toosome formats are clearly supported heavier than others there are arcade games in the list of which are also neo geo titles mainly thanks to hamsters sterling work with the arcade archives and aca neo geo seriesmeanwhile although there are nes games available through switch online the presence of mega man castlevania kuniokun and snk compilations means you actually have access to nes titles in total thats nearly a fifth of its entire western librarythe home console era is well represented too with the snes and mega drive getting and titles respectively mainly due to the snes switch online service and sega mega drive classics respectivelyquantity doesnt always equate to quality of course the atari flashback classics compilation offers an incredible games but of these are atari titles that look positively prehistoric by modern standards and may be a struggle for many gamers to get used tostill for now those are the results as they stand naturally the constantly changing nature of the switch eshop means this article is liable to become out of date before too long so well be updating it regularly as new games are releaseduntil then if theres anything you feel

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/switch-sports-review/,Switch Sports Review in Progress: A bare bones experience without online,earlier this year it was revealed that the switch had overtaken the wii in terms of total sales making it the companys best selling home console everone of the driving factors behind wiis success was the global appeal of wii sports one of the most influential accessible and inclusive launch games for any consolewith switch sports its clear that nintendo is hoping to replicate that success for a new generation but at this exact moment we cant quite determine whether its managed to pull it off yetat the time of writing this review nintendo has still yet to turn on the online servers for switch sports meaning our time with the game has been offlineonlythis wouldnt necessarily have been an issue with previous wii sports games but because the offline component of switch sports is probably the least featurepacked of any game in the series we really do have to wait until we can test the online modes before we can deliver a definitive verdict on this onefor now we can at least take a look at the six sports on offer as localonly experiencesthe first is volleyball which can be played by players and is a strictly doubles affair the aim here is to get the timing right when performing the pass set and spike moves all of which are done by flicking the joycon if you can time two or three of them well itll increase the power of the spikeof the three netbased sports in the game this is the only one where you have some degree of control over your character if youre defending at the net you can move left and right before jumping up to try and block a spikevolleyball is one of the weaker sports in the game once you get the timing down right there isnt really much more to it and you dont really feel like you have much control over your spikebadminton fares a little better if only because theres a more obvious feeling that you have a degree of control over your strokes you have no control over your player in these matches and the only moves you really have available to you are lobs to the back of the court drop shots to the front and smashesplaying this one well involves mixing up lobs and drop shots in an attempt to make your opponent stumble which happens if you swing too early or late this opens them up for an easy smashalthough badmintons controls are generally satisfying there are occasions where you may need to quickly swing and the game doesnt pick it up well meaning you just dont swing at all and lose the point it can be a frustrating affair especially against the ai on the hardest difficulty like every sport in the compilation though things are obviously improved when youre playing against another humanbecause the offline component of switch sports is probably the least featurepacked of any game in the series we really do have to wait until we can test the online modes before we can deliver a definitive verdict on this onethe only real exception to this is the third sport bowling which is perfectly enjoyable as a solo affair it plays much the same as it did back in the wii days except now you dont let go of the trigger button to throw the ball presumably to avoid reports of accidentally thrown joyconsas well as the option to play a standard game theres also a mode called special which has three difficulty levels and places various hazards on the lane sometimes youll have to deal with bollards rising and falling sometimes there will be spinning barriers on the lane and sometimes the whole lane will have a large dip in itthis is a great mode and makes for some entertaining multiplayer games where a badlytimed throw can see even a skilled players ball hitting off an obstacle and landing in the gutternext up is tennis which is one of the main sports that kicked off the wii sports craze in the first place nintendo has adopted an if it aint broke dont fix it policy with this one so as was the case years ago matches are doublesonly and players cant control movement only their swingsit feels like it plays a little slower than the wii sports version but other than that its pretty much business as usual and anyone who got a kick out of the original back in the day will feel right at home with this new versionchambara is the fifth sport and is similar to the swordplay event in wii sports resort specifically the duel mode in that players can choose to use a single sword try out a special chargeable sword or dualwield two at once with the aim being to knock the opponent off a large platformin theory the idea is that swipes can be blocked by holding the sword perpendicular to the attack if your opponent tries a downward swipe then you can block it by holding the sword horizontally in practice though this is switch sports equivalent of the boxing game in wii sports in that strategy goes out the window right away with both players flailing around like maniacs until someone winsthe package is rounded off with football which is easily the biggest surprise and most entertaining sport at least for experienced video game players the shootout mode which uses the ring fit adventure leg strap is fairly throwaway the main event here is the fantastic mode which locally can only be played by players with ai bots making up the rest of the numbersas it stands with no online the game is woefully lacking in features volleyball and badminton are the first to five points and thats it tennis is one three or five games like it was in wii sportsin our previous handson preview we said our initial reaction to football was that its basically rocket league on foot and having spent much longer with it we can confirm thats absolutely the case its a giant floaty ball in an arena with walls and a huge exploding goal where massive midair strikes are the order of the day its rocket leagueit does take some getting used to however because shots arent performed by simply ploughing into the ball but by swinging the joycon with the direction of the swing determining where it goesit soon becomes clear that this isnt exactly the most accurate way of doing things but it does add a bit of anarchy of proceedings when apparent open goals arent always a done deal we cant wait to try football out online with a full eightplayer game and thats exactly why our review of switch sports is incompleteas it stands with no online the game is woefully lacking in features volleyball and badminton are the first to five points and thats it tennis is one three or five games like it was in wii sportsits even more lacking for solo players wii sports had a progression system in which ai opponents got increasingly more difficult as players got better at each sport that isnt available here you choose one of three difficulties and thats itit doesnt even have the fun training minigames that were on the wii where you could practice your tennis skills by trying to hit targets or try to bowl over a massive pins with one throw there are no medals to earn no special achievements to unlock nothing like that just six sports in barebones fashionthats not to say there isnt some sort of progress to be made here it just appears to all be online your character can technically be customised but theres only one outfit to choose from in a variety of colours there are separate menus for hats glasses and what appears to be facemasks but theyre all empty as far as we can tell these are all unlocked by playing onlineif you werent planning to play switch sports online you may want to slap a threestar rating on this or maybe even two if youre playing alone and football doesnt appeal its slightly absurd that offline at least the game offers even less than the original wii sports did and wii sports resort the best in the series blows it out of the waterits clear however that the online play at least promises some degree of progression and variety for that reason were holding fire until we can see how much depth there is online before delivering our final verdictat this stage switch sports feels like an unambitious retread of a game with very little in the way of options all eyes are now on the online modes when they go up to see if they breathe new life into it,en,551.0,Positive

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/playdate-review/,Review: The Playdate is fun but its quirks may wind you up,apologies in advance but allow us to get this word out of the way before this review begins hipsteryes it may be a little lazy to just throw that out there but lets face it its likely what some people reading this may be thinking so we might as well just open with itafter all the playdate is a small handheld with a blackandwhite screen delivers software in a strangely gimmicky way is controlled with a quirky crank on the side of the unit and was even made by a company from portland widely agreed to be the hipster capital of the worldthe only way the thing could be more hipster is if it also printed polaroid photos that each had zooey deschanel superimposed onto themso yes if we had to describe the playdate with only one word thats the first one that springs to mind however if we had more words to describe it which given that we have this lovely website here we fortunately do wed also throw in inventive charming and unusual if a little flawed tooplaydate is a small handheld its roughly the same size as the top half of a game boy advance sp although its thinner and has a smaller screenthis screen will likely be the best or worst feature of the playdate depending on your own personal tastes its blackandwhite display uses sharps memory lcd technology which essentially acts like an ebook reader but with a much quicker refresh ratethis means battery life is significantly longer because as with ereaders the display remembers whether each pixel is on or off and keeps it in that state until it needs to be refreshed rather than constantly refreshing itthe screen only has a resolution but the small display means it looks pleasantly sharp with optimal lighting more on that in a second still images can look really impressive and the pixels are small enough that developers can produce effective mock greyscale by using a checkerboard patternits not perfect however some games display an odd shimmering and flickering effect when scrolling quickly between dark and light areas this isnt visible in directly captured footage such as our video in the next section of this review proving that it isnt an issue with the games themselves but the way the display handles them its not gamebreaking by any means but it can be distractingthe most obvious issue however is that the screen doesnt have a backlight its a reflective display which in theory means it can be seen in a wide variety of lighting conditions and we were admittedly surprised by how dark we could make the environment and still see the screennaturally if the rooms pitch black you can forget about seeing anything but we tried the scientific method of waiting until morning and playing it under the bedsheets in a sort of makeshift tent and we could still see it finethe thing is however fine wont be good enough for some players who have been conditioned to expect consistently high quality performance from modern electronicsit goes without saying that the screen still looks its best when underneath a strong light source and when we played in any other conditions wed be lying if we said we werent constantly tilting and adjusting the thing to try and make the screen look as clear as possible something made trickier when you have to operate some games with a crank and are naturally moving the device as a resultspeaking of the crank its obviously the playdates most unique feature and it works well for the most part it tucks away neatly inside a slot in the console and can be pulled out and turned whenever needed then put back in its little nook ensuring it isnt always sticking out and prone to accidentally snapping offthe crank itself is loose enough that its exceptionally easy to turn which will be useful for games where it has to be rotated quickly not that many of those released so far need that and its very responsive in all the games weve played that support itthat said we wouldve preferred some sort of resistance or maybe even a little clicking effect sort of like a fishing rod to make it a bit more tactile this is obviously down to personal taste and were sure clicking would annoy people nearby but the fact the crank is so loose did give us a slight disconnect from the experience at times it doesnt provide that tactile impact that pressing a button or moving a stick to its limit doesthe crank aside everything else is designed as well as could be expected the dpad and the two face buttons are pleasantly clicky and comfortable and battery life is goodconsidering the display never actually turns off you can only press a sleep button which displays a clock you can leave it lying for quite a few days before needing to plug the thing back in much like an eink version of a kindle and it recharges fairly quickly toothe sound quality is also decent which is useful because many of the games we played so far have fantastic soundtracks some can sound a little distorted if you turn the volume up to the maximum but theres a headphone port too which lets you enjoy the audio at its best if you like it loudthe playdate doesnt have a builtin store and there are no slots for physical media though its possible to sideload it with usercreated gamesthe main event then is the consoles season one content which consists of games which are regularly delivered to the playdate in the form of little giftwrapped presents that appear on the main menuthese games are released over the course of weeks with two games arriving each week on a certain day a play date if you willwe were given access to all games at an increased rate so we could cover them for the purposes of this review and we were generally pleased at the diversity and quality of titles on offernaturally the main gimmick here is the idea of having a nice surprise when a new game is delivered so we do understand if you dont want to find out about the games included especially if you already have a playdate preorderedhowever if youre curious about what season one has in store we put together this hefty video showing you all games in actionnotice to display this embed please allow the use of functional cookies in cookie preferenceswhile we were generally happy with the quality of the games on offer it should be noted that there are no standout killer apps as suchthe indie nature of the playdate seems to have ensured that no one game is given prominence over the others and while the games are released in a set order theres no logical sequence that we could determine it doesnt appear that the handhelds creator panic is trying to open with a bang or finish on a high or anything like thatthe fact that players only get two games for the first week with their playdate also means they may find themselves in a strange situation where theyre twiddling their thumbs waiting for more things to do with their handheldwhile there are already a few developers who have created games that can be sideloaded there arent exactly a wealth of these at the moment meaning its likely that players may get bored with the initial two titles one of which is a pretty basic minigame and may start to find themselves frustrated by the processthe fact that players only get two games for the first week with their playdate also means they may find themselves in a strange situation where theyre twiddling their thumbs waiting for more things to do with their handheldthis frustration will likely be intensified when the second week rolls along and one of the two new additions is a strange music sequencer gizmo instead of a gamewe understand that this is the consoles gimmick and as such theres no option to speed up the process everyone has to wait three months to get all the games they paid for because thats just how it workshowever the fact that the process starts for each player when they first turn on their playdate means its not like everyone is getting the same games on the same date so the idea of releasing them in a staggered manner can feel arbitrary and like its being quirky for quirkinesss sakewe can see situations where players who only just received their playdate have to sit there jealously as others who received theirs earlier are on social media sharing pictures of games they wont be able to get until two months down the lineindie games often thrive on wordofmouth leading to impulse purchases someone tweets about a cool game theyve played and other players think i like the look of that and immediately head off to buy it that wont be possible here so were curious to see how social media discourse goes especially with those just finding about the playdate for the first timethe playdate is a curious little system with some interesting ideas some of which may prove contentious depending on your own personal tastesultimately it feels like the system will live or die by how well its community supports it with further sideloaded games the titles included as part of its first season are entertaining enough but as with any collection of games youll get hits and misses and combined they may not quite justify the cost of the unitin an ideal world the playdate will gain plenty of support from indie developers and will eventually build up a nice little library of quirky and experimental games to download and sideload but time will tell whether this actually plays out in the long runthe playdate preorders follow a firstcome firstserved system and at the time of writing the first batch has just started to ship to early adopters if youre reading this review and youre tempted to preorder be aware that you wont get it until may actually be a blessing in disguise however because by the time the backlog has been cleared the state of the playdates community will be more clearly definedwell know how many other people have created games to be sideloaded and well know how well panic plans to spotlight these games and make them discoverablewe may also know if a season two of games is coming and whether panic plans to charge for it this timewe absolutely welcome the playdates presence the games industry needs more curious little gizmos like this to spark creativity and make sure we dont spiral entirely into a world of cookiecutter predictabilitywe absolutely welcome the playdates presence the games industry needs more curious little gizmos like this to spark creativity and make sure we dont spiral entirely into a world of cookiecutter predictabilityhowever given its quirky control system its loveitorhateit divisive display and its asyet unknown level of support the playdate isnt going to be to everyones tastes especially given that it isnt exactly cheap for what it offersat a price of this monochrome handheld only costs less than a switch lite in the us and may cost substantially more than one in other countries when you take shipping and customs duties into accountits very much the definition of an acquired taste then but chances are you already know if the playdates design and delivery model are something you like the sound of if youre sold on the concept were happy to confirm that the execution works exactly as promisedat launch the playdate is a quirky and fun handheld with plenty of potential until that potential is met though its methodical content delivery process may prove frustrating at least until its community supports it with more games that can be sideloaded,en,722.0,Positive

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/nintendo-switch-sports-online/,Review: Switch Sports is transformed by its online modes,last week we published a review in progress of nintendo switch sports saying it was impossible to give a definitive verdict on it at that pointat the time of writing that review nintendo had still yet to turn on the online servers for switch sports meaning our time with the game was offlineonlyour concern was that because the offline component of switch sports is probably the least featurepacked of any game in the series the online really needed to deliver longevity in order to make it a worthwhile purchase especially for those who dont have people to play nearbythankfully now weve spent some extensive time with the games online multiplayer we can happily state that switch sports does indeed offer an entertaining packagebefore we look at the offline mode however lets break down the six sports on offerthe first is volleyball which can be played by players and is a strictly doubles affair the aim here is to get the timing right when performing the pass set and spike moves all of which are done by flicking the joycon if you can time two or three of them well itll increase the power of the spikeof the three netbased sports in the game this is the only one where you have some degree of control over your character if youre defending at the net you can move left and right before jumping up to try and block a spikevolleyball is one of the weaker sports in the game once you get the timing down right there isnt really much more to it and you dont really feel like you have much control over your spikebadminton fares better if only because theres a more obvious feeling that you have a degree of control over your strokes you have no control over your player in these matches and the only moves you really have available to you are lobs to the back of the court drop shots to the front and smashesplaying this one well involves mixing up lobs and drop shots in an attempt to make your opponent stumble which happens if you swing too early or late this opens them up for an easy smashalthough badmintons controls are generally satisfying there are occasions where you may need to quickly swing and the game doesnt pick it up well meaning you just dont swing at all and lose the point it can be a frustrating affair especially against the ai on the hardest difficultylike every sport in the compilation though things are obviously improved when youre playing against another human and when playing online badminton was one of the sports we found ourselves returning to on a regular basisthe third sport bowling bucks the trend in that its perfectly enjoyable as a solo affair too it plays much the same as it did back in the wii days except now you dont let go of the trigger button to throw the ball presumably to avoid reports of accidentally thrown joyconsas well as the option to play a standard game theres also a mode called special which has three difficulty levels and places various hazards on the lane sometimes youll have to deal with bollards rising and falling sometimes there will be spinning barriers on the lane and sometimes the whole lane will have a large dip in itthis is a great mode and makes for some entertaining local multiplayer games where a badlytimed throw can see even a skilled players ball hitting off an obstacle and landing in the gutterthings are obviously improved when youre playing against another human and when playing online badminton was one of the sports we found ourselves returning to on a regular basisnext up is tennis which is one of the main sports that kicked off the wii sports craze in the first place nintendo has adopted an if it aint broke dont fix it policy with this one so as was the case years ago matches are doublesonly and players cant control movement only their swingsit feels like it plays a little slower than the wii sports version but other than that its pretty much business as usual and anyone who got a kick out of the original back in the day will feel right at home with this new versionchambara is the fifth sport and is similar to the swordplay event in wii sports resort specifically the duel mode in that players can choose to use a single sword try out a special chargeable sword or dualwield two at once with the aim being to knock the opponent off a large platformin theory the idea is that swipes can be blocked by holding the sword perpendicular to the attack if your opponent tries a downward swipe then you can block it by holding the sword horizontally in practice though this is switch sports equivalent of the boxing game in wii sports in that strategy goes out the window right away with both players flailing around like maniacs until someone winsthe package is rounded off with football which is easily the biggest surprise and most entertaining sport at least for experienced video game players the shootout mode which uses the ring fit adventure leg strap is fairly throwaway the main event here is the fantastic mode which locally can only be played by players with ai bots making up the rest of the numbersin our previous handson preview we said our initial reaction to football was that its basically rocket league on foot and having spent much longer with it we can confirm thats absolutely the case its a giant floaty ball in an arena with walls and a huge exploding goal where massive midair strikes are the order of the day its rocket leagueit does take some getting used to however because shots arent performed by simply ploughing into the ball but by swinging the joycon with the direction of the swing determining where it goesit soon becomes clear that this isnt exactly the most accurate way of doing things but it does add a bit of anarchy of proceedings when apparent open goals arent always a done dealfootball is a good way to end things too because its the one sport we were particularly keen to try out online and now that weve been able to test network play with eight players its definitely our favourite of the bunchlocally switch sports is woefully lacking in features volleyball and badminton are the first to five points and thats it tennis is one three or five games like it was in wii sportsif youre playing with friends or family members that may be all you need of course wii sports wasnt exactly swimming in options and we dont need to tell you how popular that turned out to besolo players however will find the offline mode sorely lacking wii sports had a progression system in which ai opponents got increasingly more difficult as players got better at each sport that isnt available here you choose one of three difficulties and thats itit doesnt even have the fun training minigames that were on the wii where you could practice your tennis skills by trying to hit targets or try to bowl over a massive pins with one throw there are no medals to earn no special achievements to unlock nothing like that just six sports in barebones fashionthat is until you connect online and suddenly theres a worthwhile reason to continue playing the gameall six sports can be played online and given the popularity of the switch and the apparent strong start to the games sales we were able to easily and quickly find opponents no matter what time of day it waswhile most events play just like they do in the offline mode with the obvious added bonus that youre playing against strangers online and therefore their strategies and ability level will be different every time football and bowling offer something differentall six sports can be played online and given the popularity of the switch and the apparent strong start to the games sales we were able to easily and quickly find opponents no matter what time of day it wasfootball is the most obvious as previously mentioned whereas the mode only allows two players locally playing online fills each team for a full match this completely transforms the experienceeven though youre playing against people youve likely never met before in your life everything suddenly has meaning pulling off a perfect pass connecting with a cross with a diving header or clearing the ball off your goal line feels infinitely more satisfying when you know someone somewhere appreciates itbowling meanwhile turns into a sort of survival mode with players taking part at once every three frames the scoreboard is split in two and the bottom half is eliminatedthis is a great call for two reasons if means if youre doing badly you dont have to play through a full frames in order to get the experience points waiting for you at the end and if youre doing well it adds an extra degree of tension knowing a mistake or two can drop you outwe are disappointed however that the special mode with the obstacles on the lane isnt available online but hopefully that gets added as an option or a limitedtime event in the futurewe feel that could make games less predictable because as it currently stands youll sometimes end up in a group with someone who gets more strikes than the london underground and an obstacleridding lane could have them slipping up on occasionthe most crucial aspect of switch sports online play however is the customisation the game gives you experience points after playing each game with more points given for winning or playing particularly well and these are spent on customisation itemsthese range from single pieces of clothing like glasses hats or masks to things like emotes and titles for your username there are limited time sets each containing items and each time you earn enough experience to level up you get one at random get all and youll unlock a special itemthese sets appear to be available for weeks and we estimate that good players will be able to unlock everything in just a few hours while bad players will only need to take a little longer the lions share of xp is given for simply participatingwhats more theres a complete lack of monetisation meaning its that rarest of beasts a game with a relatively light live service component but one that can be comfortably handled and isnt extortionateof course lets not allow the online functionality to distract from the limitations of local play if you werent planning to play switch sports online you may want to slap a threestar rating on this or even two if you plan on playing soloits slightly absurd that offline at least the game offers even less than the original wii sports did and wii sports resort the best in the series blows it out of the wateras a local game switch sports may keep casual players happy in the same way wii sports tennis and bowling did but anyone looking for any degree of variety in terms of game modes rules or unlockables will find it sorely lackingtake it online however and suddenly what felt like a disappointingly empty experience becomes a thriving community of players all waiting to give you a different challenge each time with those outfits acting as an incentive to keep playing something thats absent offlinenintendo switch sports really is a game of two halves offline the game is sorely lacking in features but may still be enough for families looking for some simple fun solo players however will want to head online which is where the game progression system and its real longevity can be found,en,693.0,Positive

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/opinion/heres-why-deus-ex-and-tomb-raider-could-thrive-under-embracer/#comments,Here’s why Deus Ex and Tomb Raider could thrive under Embracer,when square enix acquired eidos in it came as quite the surprisethe final fantasy publisher hadnt indicated any desire to make a big western acquisition in fact the year before it had attempted to acquire japanese publisher tecmo which was best known for games like dead or alive and ninja gaidenon one side it felt like an opportunistic move eidos market valuation was low and the currency situation between the uk and japan was favourable but it also made a lot of sense there was significant anxiety that the japanese games market was shrinking and square enix was unsure of how successful its brands could be outside of its home countryacquiring a business with a deep understanding of the european and us markets plus the likes of tomb raider and hitman gave square enix a real opportunity to become a major global player it also felt like a decent partner for eidos its core brands tomb raider and championship manager in particular were nolonger delivering significant resultssquare enix was seen as a master at managing and making the most from games ip it published books created merchandise developed movies admittedly so did eidos and had maintained huge brands over decades the deal caught people by surprise but it seemed to fitover the next years square enix europe as it was now called made several attempts to find new brands grow existing ones and develop tomb raider into one of the biggest games in the world there was some success and several great titles but eidos brands are as inconsistent as theyve ever been the returnoninvestment was poor and square enix never came close to challenging the likes of ea ubisoft and taketwothere was some ambitious and expensive efforts over those years one of the biggest was the tomb raider reboot developed by crystal dynamics and backed by a significant marketing campaign square enix was looking to reestablish the ip as one of the biggest in the industry eventually the game would do over million copies and become the biggest tomb raider of all time but it took a series of discounts and rereleases to get it thereduring the launch month tomb raider sold million copies which was below expectations much has been made of square enixs lofty possibly unrealistic sales targets for its western games however the company was not looking at tomb raiders past as the benchmark but rather what its competitors were achieving only five months earlier ubisoft had released assassins creed and sold seven million units in six weeks why couldnt tomb raider do the samehitman was another franchise that square enix tried to turn into a big seller namely with hitman absolution but like tomb raider the game was another that failed to reach sales targets square would experiment with an episodic hitman after that but ultimately the series wasnt delivering a good enough return as a result the publisher allowed the ip and its developer io interactive to leavethe one moment where a game did reach and exceed sales targets was deus ex human revolution in but its followup was a disappointment and the series was put on ice all of this alongside the disappointing thief reboot in saw square enix make the drastic decision to pivot away from its own brands and sign a licensing deal with marvel insteadagain the publisher invested significant money in the projects put its best developer on its flagship avengers project and went big on the marketing marvels avengers took over in and the message was clear this was a big dealyet square enix had once again overreached marvels avengers disappointed financially and critically when it arrived in the guardians of the galaxy game fared better with critics but didnt light up the charts eithereidos brands are as inconsistent as theyve ever been the returnoninvestment was poor and square enix never came close to challenging the likes of ea ubisoft and taketwoas a result square enix has been seeking a buyer for its eidos business it has been holding off green lighting projects and its even taken on workforhire projects namely with crystal dynamics supporting microsofts perfect dark rebootnow these studios have found a new home at embracer a holding company that owns numerous studios around the world and just like years ago it looks like a cutprice dealwere looking at three strong developers an eclectic and large back catalogue and the tomb raider brand all for million its significantly less than what most studios are going for these days by comparison embracer bought gearbox admittedly not all of it upfront for reality is that for all of the big brands and critical acclaim square enixs western business was simply not consistent or profitable enough it spent too much and didnt deliver enough but what embracer offers via its various subsidiares is a way to address all thata good template for crystal dynamics eidos montreal and square enix montreal is its former sister studio io interactive that developer has focused in on its hitman ip its speaking directly with its fans and its learnt to make things faster and on a budget as a result hitman is growing once again io is expanding and its even secured the james bond licencethats what these other exsquare enix studios will need to do theyll need to find a way to be more sustainable while delivering on the expectations of its players and theyll need to learn to make the most of their legacy brands whether through full remasters or digital rereleases and thanks to sister companies like koch media thq nordic gearbox saber interactive and so on they now have the knowhow around them to do all of thatthe model at embracer which is basically a group of companies that work largely independently might just be the ideal setup for these old eidos studios they can still get many of the benefits of being part of a larger group without having to deliver massive western growth for a big japanese parentlets just hope were not back here in years

Embracer,when square enix acquired eidos in it came as quite the surprisethe final fantasy publisher hadnt indicated any desire to make a big western acquisition in fact the year before it had attempted to acquire japanese publisher tecmo which was best known for games like dead or alive and ninja gaidenon one side it felt like an opportunistic move eidos market valuation was low and the currency situation between the uk and japan was favourable but it also made a lot of sense there was significant anxiety that the japanese games market was shrinking and square enix was unsure of how successful its brands could be outside of its home countryacquiring a business with a deep understanding of the european and us markets plus the likes of tomb raider and hitman gave square enix a real opportunity to become a major global player it also felt like a decent partner for eidos its core brands tomb raider and championship manager in particular were nolonger delivering significant resultssquare enix was seen as a master at managing and making the most from games ip it published books created merchandise developed movies admittedly so did eidos and had maintained huge brands over decades the deal caught people by surprise but it seemed to fitover the next years square enix europe as it was now called made several attempts to find new brands grow existing ones and develop tomb raider into one of the biggest games in the world there was some success and several great titles but eidos brands are as inconsistent as theyve ever been the returnoninvestment was poor and square enix never came close to challenging the likes of ea ubisoft and taketwothere was some ambitious and expensive efforts over those years one of the biggest was the tomb raider reboot developed by crystal dynamics and backed by a significant marketing campaign square enix was looking to reestablish the ip as one of the biggest in the industry eventually the game would do over million copies and become the biggest tomb raider of all time but it took a series of discounts and rereleases to get it thereduring the launch month tomb raider sold million copies which was below expectations much has been made of square enixs lofty possibly unrealistic sales targets for its western games however the company was not looking at tomb raiders past as the benchmark but rather what its competitors were achieving only five months earlier ubisoft had released assassins creed and sold seven million units in six weeks why couldnt tomb raider do the samehitman was another franchise that square enix tried to turn into a big seller namely with hitman absolution but like tomb raider the game was another that failed to reach sales targets square would experiment with an episodic hitman after that but ultimately the series wasnt delivering a good enough return as a result the publisher allowed the ip and its developer io interactive to leavethe one moment where a game did reach and exceed sales targets was deus ex human revolution in but its followup was a disappointment and the series was put on ice all of this alongside the disappointing thief reboot in saw square enix make the drastic decision to pivot away from its own brands and sign a licensing deal with marvel insteadagain the publisher invested significant money in the projects put its best developer on its flagship avengers project and went big on the marketing marvels avengers took over in and the message was clear this was a big dealyet square enix had once again overreached marvels avengers disappointed financially and critically when it arrived in the guardians of the galaxy game fared better with critics but didnt light up the charts eithereidos brands are as inconsistent as theyve ever been the returnoninvestment was poor and square enix never came close to challenging the likes of ea ubisoft and taketwoas a result square enix has been seeking a buyer for its eidos business it has been holding off green lighting projects and its even taken on workforhire projects namely with crystal dynamics supporting microsofts perfect dark rebootnow these studios have found a new home at embracer a holding company that owns numerous studios around the world and just like years ago it looks like a cutprice dealwere looking at three strong developers an eclectic and large back catalogue and the tomb raider brand all for million its significantly less than what most studios are going for these days by comparison embracer bought gearbox admittedly not all of it upfront for reality is that for all of the big brands and critical acclaim square enixs western business was simply not consistent or profitable enough it spent too much and didnt deliver enough but what embracer offers via its various subsidiares is a way to address all thata good template for crystal dynamics eidos montreal and square enix montreal is its former sister studio io interactive that developer has focused in on its hitman ip its speaking directly with its fans and its learnt to make things faster and on a budget as a result hitman is growing once again io is expanding and its even secured the james bond licencethats what these other exsquare enix studios will need to do theyll need to find a way to be more sustainable while delivering on the expectations of its players and theyll need to learn to make the most of their legacy brands whether through full remasters or digital rereleases and thanks to sister companies like koch media thq nordic gearbox saber interactive and so on they now have the knowhow around them to do all of thatthe model at embracer which is basically a group of companies that work largely independently might just be the ideal setup for these old eidos studios they can still get many of the benefits of being part of a larger group without having to deliver massive western growth for a big japanese parentlets just hope were not back here in years

videogameschronicle,2022/05/04,https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/wishlist-elder-scrolls-6/,Wishlist: Elder Scrolls 6 needs better combat and a more gripping story,the elder scrolls was announced too early thats pretty much universally agreed upon even by todd howardat the time he admitted that it was announced so that fans would stop asking about it but in reality its done the opposite theres a hunger for the elder scrolls that is unique to bethesda a developer that holds the keys to so many of the biggest franchises in modern gaminghowever recently bethesda softworks had endured a bit of a rough patch between fallout terrible console versions and the fallout saga its not quite at the peak of its powers like it was when the elder scrolls was first announcedin skyrim is hanging about like that guy you always see in the pub when you go back to your home town sure at first its fun to reminisce about what it was like in but soon theres this lingering feeling that we all should have moved on and no matter how rosetinted the stories are all you can remember is the five times your save has been lost or the version that would break in bigger and more explosive ways the more you played itstarfield will really set the table for bethesda in terms of how this game is going to be received if starfield is a triumph a genuine leap forward and doesnt feel like a supedup bethesda game then it will have all the goodwill in the world going into the elder scrolls however if its a buggy mess which has very much been the mo of bethesda on consoles will players put up with itwhat if its not actually that different a big reason that fallout is harshly looked back upon with disappointment is that despite the superficial changes that bethesda made its not all that different from the games that came before it its also clear that the bethesda storytelling style is wearing thin dialogue options have never felt thinner or more inconsequential thats what the elder scrolls needs to course correctfor us one of the key things that will set the elder scrolls apart from its predecessor is the combat this cant simply be the clumsy melee combat of bethesda games past two competitors wiggle their swords at each other until one of their souls leaves their body and they crumble in a heap like a mannequin thats been pushed from a tenthfloor windowchivalry provides the perfect template for how highfantasy combat could work in an rpg if youre unfamiliar on the surface chivalry presents itself as a somewhat serious game about armies of knights battling it out over a series of control points in reality its a bit more like im king arthur welcome to jackass as players have a penchant to simply run in and throw their swords blindly into groups of soldiershowever if you manage to find yourself in a situation in chivalry youll be plunged into an incredibly fun rockpaperscissors style battle of parrying blocking and reposting its also brutally gorey with limbs and heads flying everywhere every battle is genuinely engaging and as you get better at it you feel like a threat to anyone while a new player will swing wildly at you if you know what youre doing you can parry with one movement and then divorce their head from their shoulders with the nextif the combat in the elder scrolls was anywhere near that fun there wouldnt be a bandit camp in the entire game that would be safe one of the best elements of skyrims levelling system was that if the player used a certain skill over and over again the character would get better at it you sneak a lot your sneaking improves with an entirely skillbased combat system the player would improve their characters skill by literally getting better at the gameits hard to predict what the landscape of fantasy media will be when the elder scrolls releases its strange to think that when skyrim was first released there was only one series of game of thrones and the hundreds of alsoran series that followed hadnt reached our screens when skyrim was being developed and written the mainstream point of reference with high fantasy was the lord of the ringsthis will undoubtedly change the tone of the elder scrolls while the elder scrolls games have always dabbled with darker tones and political intrigue we expect this to be a much larger focus in the elder scrolls sure by the time that game of thrones had ended the fanbase had completely turned on it but its impossible to deny that for a few series in the middle the world was gripped by it in a way that fantasy rarely doesits also impossible to ignore the mammoth impact that the witcher had on the fantasy rpg genre with incredible writing and long involved side quests that people are still talking about half a decade later the bar has forever been raised by cd projectbethesda game studios will be keenly aware of this and desperate to retake their crown wed love a focus on these long side stories and less disposable single objective quests while these were fine in go here collect x feels antiquated now never mind how it will feel when the elder scrolls launchesit feels weird thinking about a game that literally only existed as a gif when it was announced bethesda is fully focused on starfield and whatever expansions and dlc that will likely follow if starfield makes it out this year and it gets a year of support its probably going to be late before we really start seeing the elder scrolls it a game how will the landscape of gaming have changed by then theres certainly a feeling in the air that the openworld game is in dire need of a revamp theres not been a genuine revolution in the space outside of arguably red dead redemption the elder scrolls could provide thatwill we be looking at midgeneration refreshes for the and xbox series x it certainly seems possible bethesda knows that with the exception of gta vi it has the most anticipated game in recent memory on its hands remember the hype for cyberpunk the road to the elder scrolls is going to be just as unhingedbut how will bethesda respond will it attempt to move the genre in a completely new direction or will starfield form the basis of the new bethesda game studios and the elder scrolls will improve upon it just like you can see the roots of skyrim in fallout youll only be waiting another years to find out,en,534.0,Positive
