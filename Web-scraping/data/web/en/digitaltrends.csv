technology combined with ongoing support for psvr makes for a more immersive gaming experiencespeaking of peripherals and hardware both iterations of the console use amd chips across the board

allows for more advanced lighting in games it also comes with a bluray player putting it in line with the xbox one s and xbox one x in layman terms the is technically less powerful than the xbox series x but still packs a punch and represents a massive upgrade from lastgen consolesif discs aren your thing or you simply want to save some cash look no further than the digital edition it retails for less than the standard but is identical in terms of specs the only difference between the two is that the digital edition has no disc drive meaning ultra hd blurays are out of the equation and you need to rely on digital downloads everything else including the launch lineup remains the samethe main issue with the is that even after over a year on the market they still hard to find due in part

the future there will be a slew of internallink sponsoredfalsegreat games for xbox series x down the road including the longawaited perfect dark reboot state of decay a new installment of fable and plenty of other titlesin the meantime xbox series x owners have no shortage of games to play xbox series x will support every previous generation of xbox games similar to how xbox one did this means

crossplatform opportunities than sony offeringswhile the xbox series x is a powerful machine it also a surprisingly quiet one the console cooling architecture is incredibly efficient so much so you might wonder if the console is even on at times the xbox one by comparison is as loud as can bewhy you should buy this you want a console gaming experience but on the go with unmatched firstparty supportwho it for everyonewhy we picked the nintendo switch nintendo sidestepped the current console arms race by changing not how you use your console but where the switch is a hybrid device that plugs into a tv like the and xbox series x but also works as a handheldwhile it doesn quite have the oomph to play the latest fps releases slated for nextgen consoles the switch can play doom at a smooth fps anywhere you want and that more than enough for a lot of gamers in addition to contemporary titles like control the switch is a fantastic venue for reviving modern classics such as the witcher la noire and dark souls remasteredmore than just a clearance house for lightlyaged aaa titles the switch also offers an evergrowing catalog of fantastic firstparty games like super mario odyssey the legend of zelda breath of the wild and animal crossing new horizons as well as excellent indies such asstardew valleyceleste andori and the will of the wisps add in some oldschool nintendo nostalgia with a growing list of nes and snes games through nintendo switch online and the switch is a wellrounded consolethe nintendo switch is also a great companion console for anyone who already owns a playstation or xbox console it can do things the competition can and offers a host of great titles that will likely never appear on a sony or microsoft systemwhy you should buy this the nintendo switch oled is a midgeneration upgrade that boasts a bigger better screen and a flurry of bells and whistles to warrant the price of entry at it ideal for those who are jumping into the switch family for the first time especially if you plan on primarily playing in handheld modewho it for players who want a betterlooking screen in handheld mode or who play online while docked it great for users who plan on upgrading or who have never owned a switch system beforewhy we picked the nintendo switch oled we picked up the oled to take advantage of the bigger more vibrant screen it fascinating just how much better the new oled screen looks compared to the lcd display on the original model and the larger screen on the new oled model is a major improvement giving you a bit more mileage out of the device without increasing the size of the machine overallthe switch oled is an excellent choice because it uses all the accessories from the previous model including joycon controllers dock microsd memory cards and of course games this means users who are upgrading can use all of their old accessories on the new oled modelwhile the switch oled does play all the same games as the original switch games simply look better on the new machine at least in handheld mode when placing both systems side by side it easy to see the difference between the two screens since the oled has a builtin lan port in the dock you be able to plug in an ethernet cable to enjoy online gaming without some of the headaches that come with using wifiusers who like to play in tabletop mode will be pleased with the switch oled new kickstand which covers the entire backside of the system this is a huge improvement over the thin flimsy kickstand on the original model overall the original switch still gets the job done but the oled model is a significant improvement in more ways than one like the original switch the oled won run games at a higher fidelity but is perfect for those who love highquality nintendo games or ports of older beloved classics especially in handheld modewhy you should buy this this lastgen console has a healthy catalog of toptier games and the price tag has dropped since the release of the it for anyone who wants to game without breaking the bankwhy we picked the playstation pro while plenty of gamers are making the jump to the playstation there still a lot of life left in lastgen consoles the playstation pro is still a serious gaming machine with a vast library of games and the console price tag and the cost of games accessories etc only is going to continue to drop the pro is also slightly easier to find than the though most modern consoles have suffered from low availability following the recent chip shortage the pro delivers an impressive playing experience for television owners because of the enhanced graphics and sharper images for titleswe not going to pretend that the pro is close to matching the superior but it still a worthwhile gaming experience aside from a handful of titles exclusive to the you going to have access to most major titles out now and all the most popular freetoplay titlesprice is a major factor when deciding whether to upgrade to a new system there no shame in snagging a lastgen console to play with until the becomes less expensive and more widely availablewhy you should buy thisthe nintendo switch lite is the best handheld game console out right now giving you access to all the latest and greatest nintendo titles without the price tag of its hybrid counterpartwho it for everyonewhy we picked the nintendo switch lite if you plan on only using your nintendo switch in handheld mode the nintendo switch lite makes for a great option at a slightly lower price point it lacks the television docking support of the standard system but features a smaller size and a slightly better battery life than the updated switch console that launched last year it compatible out of the box with nearly every nintendo switch game as well and is perfect for games like pokmon sword and shieldditching the joyconsthe switch lite comes with an allinone design its almost an inch shorter in width making it more compact than the original coming in at ounces its lighter but not so much that it feels flimsy being smaller than its predecessor the button layout had to be altered slightly but the console is still incredibly comfortable and easy to navigatethere arent any obvious differences in gaming performance on the smaller console either revving up the field in rocket leagueor building your defenses in a tense fortnite match will feel just as smooth on the switch lite display versus the original switchs screen with no dock hdmi support or joycons the switch lite doesnt have tv support or motion controls which slightly impacts your gaming options but most of the switch library is availablewhy you should buy this it has of the best games ever made for only retail pricewho it fornintendo fans old and new and those who grew up with video gameswhy we picked the snes classic edition the era saw nintendo at the peak of its creativity releasing popular acclaimed games like the legend of zelda a link to the past and super metroid alongside cult hits like earthbound thirdparty companies didn take a backseat with square enix final fantasy vi and konami super castlevania iv among the best games of all timewith the plugandplay snes classic edition you can experience all over yourfavorite classic super nintendo games as you remembered them through retro gaming there even a crt filter option mimicking the look of your old televisionwith the addition of a savestate feature playing old nintendo games on the snes classic is significantly less frustrating than it was years ago and when you ready to sit down and game with a buddy classics like super mario kart and street fighter ii turbo hyper fighting give you a chance to compete for bragging rightsthe snes classic edition also is the only way to play star fox of the nintendo switch online servicea game nintendo canceled just before its original release date to unlock it you just need to beat the first level of the original star fox but it will be very tough to pull yourself away once you start playingwhy you should buy this the genesis mini is segas retro console offering renewing the classic rivalry in a new erawho it for those who preferred sonics blazing speed to marios blockbreaking wayswhy we picked the sega genesis miniwhile the snes classic was our top retro pick there are some golden age classics that only can be found on the sega genesis from groundbreaking platformers sonic the hedgehog arguably when the company speedy mascot was in his prime and earthworm jimto iconic fighter kings streets of rage mortal kombat iiyou have to admit that sega has just as many stellar nostalgic titles as its nintendo counterpart consolethe sega genesis mini features games of which are sega classics while the once genesisbound tetris and arcade shoot em up darius sweeten the pot the package includes a sleek miniaturized version of the sega genesis console and two classic controllers the console is ready to plug and play and includes a power adapter and an hdmi cablethe games are presented almost exactly as they were but the console does include a saveanywhere function which is quite a timesaver overall your preference for retro console will largely be driven by whether you prefer segas lineup or nintendos there are certainly no wrong choices and this is exemplified by the fact that these consoles still generate hype decades laterwhy you should buy this sonys playstation vr headset is the most affordable way to give virtual reality gaming a trywho it gamers or anyone who want to play virtual reality gameswhy we picked playstation vr okay we know that playstation vr isn technically a standalone gaming console but it might as well be with the way it completely transforms gaming on the a new playstation and a headset bundle comes in a lot less expensive than a gaming pc and either an oculus rift or htc viveheadset making it the most affordable virtual reality gaming option by a long shotit should come as no surprise that the playstation vr headset does not have the technical capabilities of its full vr counterparts the headset sports a pair of rgb displays one for each eye and runs off the amd radeon gpu which is far less powerful than the minimum required specs for a vive or riftcompatible pc it also has a field of view which is slightly smaller than the rift and vive that being said playstation vr achieves that feeling of complete immersion that comes from a full vr device as opposed to mobilepowered options like google cardboardthere are so many fantastic games available on the platform ranging from action and shooter to platformer puzzle and a slew of others good luck trying to figure out which are the best to play or which you can handle being fully immersed inif you havent used vr much the playstation vr will blow you away if you tried more advanced vr tech you might be a little let down but this is the most consumerfriendly way to play vr games in the comfort of your own homewe still waiting to see how well sony psvr performs but based on what we know about it so far it seems to be a huge leap ahead of its predecessorthe and the xbox series x support highresolution gaming that can take advantage of emerging display standards and high dynamic range hdr some people don have a tv and fewer still have quality hdr support which is broken down into its own subcategorieswhile there was just a small selection of games for lastgen consoles that took full advantage of these features the newest slate of consoles will better leverage these technologies moving forward essentially standardizing them keep in mind however that no console requires you to own a or hdrcompatible tv meaning you can buy a new console and hold off on buying a more capable tv until youve done more research found games you feel are worth upgrading for or are otherwise ready to commitif you do decide to purchase a new tv for the sake of a video game console you should look for a tv that runs at and supports hdr as opposed to hdr premium,en,1217,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/genshin-impact-how-to-level-up-fast-and-earn-xp/,How to level up your characters quickly in Genshin Impact,genshin impacts release set a new standard for freetoplay gacha games combining their addictive hunt for new characters with a fullfeatured and gorgeous openworld rpg like any gacha game a big part of the fun in genshin impact is finding new characters to build out a great team through lucky draws to make that team actually work well together though youll need to spend a lot of time getting them leveled up enough to take on progressively tougher challengesexp materialsthe level grind in genshin impact certainly isnt the worst out there but it can take a major time investment to build out your party especially if you dont know the best way to go about it to save you the frustration of leveling at a snails pace rather than actually enjoying everything the game has to offer heres how to level up quickly in genshin impactfurther readingthe best openworld gamesthe best freetoplay games for ways genshin impact is better than breath of the wildthe most important thing to realize about leveling in genshin impact is that youre not going to do it efficiently by fighting monsters that may seem odd when thats exactly how level grinding works in most other rpgs but genshin impact approaches things differently while the combat in genshin impact is flashy to watch and satisfying to play its not the games real focus where genshin impact really shines is in exploration and accordingly thats the best way to level up your characters in the gameto level up fast in genshin impact youll want to focus your energy on collecting exp materials as you explore the world of teyvat youll come across items called wanderers advice adventurers experience and heros wit worth exp xp and exp respectively using these is by far the quickest way to level up your party membersfortunately these materials are fairly easy to find in your travels with the most valuable exp materials naturally being harder to find exp materials are a common reward for completing quests and theyre frequently found in treasure chests scattered around the world as well these are all activities that will also increase your adventure rank which can net you even more exp materials as you rank upwhile youll end up finding a decent amount of exp materials no matter what you choose to spend your time on in genshin impact there are a few activities that grant these allimportant items much more reliablywhen we think of grinding out levels we often look to other side activities before the main plot but just by following the main story of genshin impact you can get a ton of exp and adventure rank at the same time the only downsides to this is that these missions are a little lengthy and can only be completed one time so while the payout is good and more fun to do than some of the more repetitive tasks they wont bring you to endgame levelcompleting domains is one of the best ways to level up quickly in genshin impact these repeatable dungeons appear throughout the map each offering slightly different rewards you can find domains marked by an icon that looks like a diamond with a blue dot in the center and youll usually have to complete a short puzzle or even a quest chain to unlock each one domains specialize in various important items that they offer as rewards such as artifacts or weapon ascension materials and youll be able to see a preview of possible rewards before you take one on so you wont waste your time getting items you dont needthats what makes domains a good place to find exp materials youll regularly find these items in domains along with other rewards that youll need to boost your weapons and characters making them a convenient onestop shop for progressing through the game they also offer fun challenges that can scale to match your level and you can come back anytime you want the downside of using domains is that it costs resin a pop to collect your rewards and that same resource is used to acquire pretty much every material youll need to progress past the early stages of genshin impact exp materials also arent one of the specialized rewards offered by domains so the amount you get can varyan even faster way to level up is to farm exp materials by activating blossom of revelation ley line outcrops like domains ley line outcrops are repeatable activities that show up on the map blossom of revelation ley line outcrops will show up with an icon that looks like a wisp of blue smoke activating one will trigger a short combat encounter with a few enemies around your level and once you defeat them you can claim the rewards in exchange for original resin the advantages of using a blossom of revelation ley line outcrop are that youre always guaranteed to win a stack of exp materials and theyre much quicker to complete than domains if youre only looking to level your characters as quickly as possible and dont need materials to level up weapons or talents which can be just as important tackling blossoms of revelation is the way to goeven if youre focused on ley line outcrops to quickly grind for exp materials there are a few things that can trip you up in your quest to level up your charactersstep one is that it also costs mora to use exp materials so its possible to run low enough on money that you cant level up anymore mora is pretty easy to come by in genshin impact but if you find yourself a little short you may want to consider taking on a few blossom of wealth ley line outcrops these are marked with yellow smoke icons on your map and they function identically to blossoms of revelation except that they offer mora instead of exp materials it also costs resin to claim their rewards though so theres a limit to how much you can use themstep another source of rewards including exp materials that is easily forgotten is your trusty adventurers handbook you will accomplish most of these tasks naturally while playing and doing other things and youll be rewarded with various items the ones that you might not do automatically are usually very simple and wont take much time to knock out you do need to do every task in a specific chapter of the handbook before more open up so make sure to clear them all out so you can start working on the next set each subsequent chapter has better and better rewards so dont slack on themstep its just as important to spend your exp materials wisely as it is to collect them in the first place since characters are drawn randomly in genshin impact youre more or less guaranteed to recruit some characters that you just dont like or dont fit your party composition rather than trying to keep all of your characters around the same level try to pick a core group of four characters that get first dibs on all exp materials with an alternate or two if you need to use a specific element or ability when you get a new character rather than immediately leveling them up take them through a lowlevel dungeon to see if you actually like their abilities and read through descriptions of how theyll progress to decide if theyll be useful in the long run,en,445,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/upcoming-switch-games/,The best upcoming Nintendo Switch games,the nintendo switch is one of the most popular consoles nintendo has ever produced with a wide variety of games to choose from and plenty of unique features weve already gotten to play new entries across the zelda super mario and pokmon series on nintendo switch but there are still plenty of great games on the way for the hybrid console this includes exclusive games developed internally by nintendo as well as thirdparty titles and ports also available on other platformssince many of the games announced at the nintendo direct and the september direct have launched already the list of upcoming games is dwindling still we know of a slew of games coming to the system in the future and on top of that theres still a lot more time for more announcements to be made so we may get even more games throughout however you slice it its an exciting time to be a nintendo fanwith that in mind there are still lots of games to look forward to on the platform these are the best upcoming nintendo switch games for and beyondrecommended reading,en,109,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-sports-review/,Nintendo Switch Sports review: Some things never get old,theres no better feeling than bowling a strike both in real life and nintendo switch sports its a small but satisfying athletic accomplishment that doesnt require years of training and discipline to pull off it can almost happen by accident with physics taking the wheel as soon as the bowling ball smashes into the pins no matter how many times i hit a strike in nintendo switch sports i always let out a silent fist pump without failthats the lasting power of nintendos now yearold sports series theres nothing fundamentally different about bowling in nintendo switch sports and wii sports but there doesnt have to be nintendos new package of sports minigames defies the normal expectation about modern games by remaining confident in its instantly gratifying gameplay instead of inventing new hooks to expand the experience no reallife bowler has ever complained that the sport doesnt add enough new features year after year after all imagine someone arguing that its time to add an pinwhen nintendo switch sports is focused on reinforcing already intuitive gameplay with more precise motion controls its every bit as addictive as wii sports it only loses points when it strives to be more complex than it needs to bethis time around nintendos anthology of sports games contains six activities at launch bowling tennis badminton chambara volleyball and soccer there are more highlights than duds in the package and theres a trend between the hits most of the best minigames with one exception require no explanationevery time i swing im surprised that the ball always goes exactly where i intendedbadminton the collections crown jewel is the perfect example of that its a more pingponglike variation of tennis that has two players volleying back and forth on a small court theres no tutorial if you know how to swing a racquet you know how to swing a joycon badminton matches are a fast and surprisingly intense test of reflexes and timing that im confident i could take to a family party and pull some smiles out of kids and adults alikethats perhaps part of the reason why the returning classics from the original wii sports remain as enjoyable as ever here bowling has barely changed with players rolling a frame game by lining up shots and swinging their arm as if it were actually holding a ball it never gets old ive spent hours on end just trying to outdo my best record and im still not tired of it though my right arm certainly is theres a special challenge mode which puts obstacles in the lane to add some variety but ive found that im still perfectly happy just playing normal roundstennis is similarly repeatable even though badminton has taken its throne its also the sport that best highlights how precise nintendos motion controls have become every time i swing im surprised that the ball always goes exactly where i intended theres rarely a moment where my sportsmate the games mii avatars does something i dont expect in the past i had to buy a clunky wiimote addon to reach that level of precision a joycon is far lighter and more accurate by comparisonnintendo switch sports best strength is that it removes as much friction from the experience as possible i barely have to think about the controller in my hand when playing its just me versus the pinswhile its simple pleasures are easy wins nintendo switch sports struggles when it tries to bring more depth to its activities volleyball for instance requires several motions players need to bump jump block set and spike the ball perhaps anticipating that it could be confusing to remember it all the game flashes commands on screen to tell players what actions to perform it feels less like playing volleyball and more like simon sayssoccer is where the struggle to create complexity stands out the most players participate in a fullfledged threeminute soccer game that has them running around a large field spending stamina to run and kicking the ball with several techniques its the only game where players need to manually move while playing characters automatically run to the ball in sports like tennis making it the most indepth game in the series so farits no surprise that soccer ends up getting outclassed by its more strippeddown variantits not very elegant i spend matches slowly running across the open field barely ever getting my foot on the ball most matches i play go to overtime with no team managing to score a single point part of the issue is that swinging a remote to kick goes against the simple brilliance of the series where motion controls mimic real actions one to one its no surprise that soccer ends up getting outclassed by its more strippeddown variant a fun shootout mode where players can use a leg strap attachment to physically kick leg strap support will be added to the standard soccer mode this year but i doubt ill go back to it once mario strikers battle league hits switch this summer whereas ill gladly play switch sports tennis over mario tennis aces anytimeadding more moving parts to a sport isnt an inherently flawed idea though chambara is one of the games more tutorialloaded activities and also one of its clearest standouts the sword fighting mode has players blocking and slashing by turning the joycon diagonally vertically and horizontally its a surprisingly strategic battle thats especially fun with a friend you can smack talkchambara works because the core motions are easy to grasp i turn my joycon to the side and my characters sword turns with it simple thats the appeal of the nintendo sports series i want to roll a bocce ball swing a cricket bat or push discs down a shuffleboard all free ideas nintendo anything more than that feels like it betrays the series secret weapon its low barrier for entrythe most alluring aspect of nintendo switch sports is that nintendo has already committed to longterm support free updates later this year will add golf to the game expanding the roster of activities with another surefire hit thats important because with six games at launch two of which arent too exciting the game selection is half that of wii sports resort the promise of more sports and free updates means that the game will be a bit more of an ongoing service and not one you need to pay a day to useits the kind of game thatll be an essential part of any switch owners collection in the back half of its lifefull online play is another crucial even if expected addition here and the game pushes players to buy into that gear like clothing for sportsmates can only be unlocked via online play the game cycles in sets of gear thatll only be available for a few weeks at a time pushing players to rank up and unlock every piece before they vanish i appreciate that theres a light reward loop but it does make solo and local multiplayer less enticing as neither awards prizes im hoping that gets changed in an update down the line as i imagine ill be playing local with friends more than online though for what its worth the online experience seems more stable than your typical nintendo game at the momentnintendo switch sports is ultimately most valuable as a party game just as wii sports was years ago i enjoy playing solo ill chase that perfect bowling game until i die but the most fun ive had with it has routinely been with other people badminton is one of the best twoplayer experiences on the entire system for my money and nothing beats a casual bowling session in a room full of friends its the kind of game thatll be an essential part of any switch owners collection in the back half of its lifethough it does call the games release strategy into question whereas wii sports was a free packin with switch consoles nintendo switch sports is a release to get a physical copy with a leg strap im skeptical that players will be willing to shell out that much for a game thats not notably different from its predecessor on paper if nintendo packages it with switch models this holiday season im convinced itll be a home run that is as long as it adds baseball to the sports lineupnintendo switch sports is exactly what it needs to be its an intuitive package of wiiera sports minigames with more precise motion controls and full online integration addictive activities like bowling and badminton make it one of the switchs best multiplayer party games though overly complicated minigames like soccer miss the simple appeal of the series with longterm support planned im hopeful that nintendo can build up the currently thin offering and turn it into the kind of console staple that any switch owner needs to have installedif you want a more dedicated indepth sports game with motion controls mario golf super rush and mario tennis aces may be more your speednintendo plans on supporting switch sports through the end of with plans to add golf and leg strap support for soccer add in online play and you could be reasonably satisfied into next yearyes if you loved wii sports theres no reason you wouldnt love this too though youll get more out of it as a multiplayer experience than a solo onenintendo switch sports was tested on a switch oled docked to a tcl ,en,620,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/gran-turismo-7-review/,Gran Turismo 7 review: Pomp and circumstance,ive never played a game as confident in itself as gran turismo as soon as i booted up polyphony digital and sony interactive entertainments latest playstation exclusive the words the real driving simulator graced the screeni was then directed to race to the beat of classical music from the royal philharmonic orchestra before watching a lengthy opening movie showing how the automobile is intertwined with history over the last century from there i discovered a game with extremely detailed car models intricate simulations and a bevy of information on the history of most major car manufacturers and the vehicles they producedthankfully this pompous attitude is earned because gran turismo is a refined beautiful driving simulator while it isnt the best choice for casual racing fun and the menus can be frustrating gran turismo is a gorgeous game that respects automobile culture so much that it wants to spread the good word to anyone who picks this game up if you werent already a fan of cars gran turismo is trying its hardest to make you one and its doing so with a confident smirk on its facegran turismo leans into its racing simulator roots much more than microsofts racing game offerings like previous games in the series the latest installment is all about buying and tuning cars for the best performance in races every car is rendered in stunning detail on and off the track taking full advantage of the the game is a tremendous showcase with smooth performance and ray tracing modes that highlight the beauty of cars under certain lighting the audio design is also quite crisp and sounds excellent in sonys pulse headset the dualsense controllers haptic feedback will respond to the surface the player is driving on and its adaptive triggers simulate what it feels like to breakevery car is rendered in stunning detail on and off the track taking full advantage of the turismo encourages players to customize and take care of their vehicles if a player doesnt frequently service their cars by washing them getting an oil change and more they will see a difference in its performance across all of gran turismo modes the backbone of the singleplayer experience is the menu objectives that players receive from a caf in the gran turismo resort these objectives range from obtaining three of a specific type of car to visiting certain facilities to placing in the top three of a championshipas its striving for a realistic feeling with its physics gran turismo feels slower than its contemporaries players wont find themselves zooming down the racetrack at over mph all the time but that isnt a bad thing gran turismo restraint in those areas makes those moments of speed more exciting and it also encourages players to be cordial to others bumping into another car wont give the player bonus points or spread debris everywhere its a tough and uncomfortable bump that will put them at a disadvantage just as much as the person they are hitting players cant rewind either so theres no undoing a crucial mistake in the last lap of a fivelap race that might cost the player their firstplace spotlaps typically last anywhere from one to five minutes on most tracks so restarts can be a momentum killer gran turismo punishes overzealous players by wasting their time which in turn encourages them to get betterthe game provides the modes and tools for players to improve players can go to the license center to learn both basic and highlevel driving maneuvers they then test them out with missions which are races with more specific parameters like driving through a certain part of a track under a time limit without hitting any walls as players complete these menus missions world circuit races and license challenges theyll earn credits that can then be used to purchase new vehicles at one of three separate dealerships or used at the tuning shop to improve the cars they already ownmore modes are built off this backbone players can visit scapes an extensive photo mode where players can take pictures of their cars around the world and really see the ray tracing in action a casual and very customizable multiplayer mode and the competitive sport multiplayer mode return from the previous entry so players can go online and show what theyve earned and customized to othersthose looking for a hardcore simulator will find that gran turismo is at the top of its class and an excellent showcase for what the can dothe final notable mode is music rally where players race to the beat of various songs trying to hit checkpoints to extend their timer and drive as far as possible this mode wont make or break gran turismo for anyone but its the most approachable one in the game and what people will come back to if they only have a couple of minutes to playsurprisingly gran turismo is also a fantastic educational tool every vehicle featured has a welldetailed entry in the games car index and gran turismo features even more supplementary material like videos from each manufacturer and museum timelines that document a companys whole history the opening movies focus on the history of the automobile is intentional the developers want to celebrate and educate people on the history of automobiles as someone only partially exposed to that world it was very informativegran turismo mainly focuses on appealing to hardcore automobile fans but its also hoping to convert anyone extra that it picks up along the way and it does make some concerted attempts to appeal to causal racing game fansunlike previous gran turismo games gran turismo has a more guided singleplayer experience to ease new players into its mechanics this mode does a great job of introducing players into an intimidating simulator though some of the later races and championships are long and frustrating in particular the final championship tasks players with driving multiple laps on five of the games longer tracksa lot of the menus feel made for a pc port that does not yet existthose willing to spend real money on credits can also speed up the process of obtaining cars by just purchasing them instead of winning them in a race which seems a bit unfair hardcore fans also might not like the fact that they need to complete some of these objectives to unlock all of the facilities and modes that gran turismo offerscompounding that problem is a user interface on the games main menu that feels clunky to use a lot of the menus feel made for a pc port that does not yet exist i constantly wished that i could use a mouse or even the dualsenses touchpad to navigate these menus but instead i had to use the dpad or control stick neither of which felt quite right thankfully information is displayed clearly enough on menus that discerning what one needs to click isnt a problemthose on the fence about picking up gran turismo need to know that this isnt like forza horizon an arcade racing game where players drive across a vast open world to complete missions and objectives this is a simulator with lots of menus and customization options that offers a more casual and friendly singleplayer structuregran turismo executes its vision of being the real driving simulator confidently but if someone wants just a few minutes of quick racing fun this game might be too technical for them its dedication to teaching the player about cars and racing might just make some casuals into hardcore fans thoughgran turismo is a comprehensive racing simulator with features that will please series fans those looking to learn about cars and people who just want to race casually while this simulator is more focused on making the player feel elegant rather than exhilarated it sticks to its vision and highlights the power of the those looking for a car simulator on consoles gran turismo is the best option out there if someone wants just a few minutes of quick racing fun id recommend forza horizon over this gamecompleting all menus to finish gran turismo me hours this time may differ depending on the difficulty one is playing on which cars they are using and how often they have to restart races racing games also dont have a definitive conclusion and are meant to be played for dozens of hoursyes car enthusiasts

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review/,Kirby and the Forgotten Land review: Waddle Dee-lightful,is there any video game series as joyful as kirby the second i booted kirby and the forgotten land up for the first time i broke out into a cheerful grin after a month spent exploring postapocalyptic wastelands i was happy to watch the pink puffball pitterpatter around colorful landscapes without a care in the worldhilariously kirby and the forgotten land actually is a postapocalyptic game kirby is sucked into another world filled with decaying shopping malls and abandoned amusement parks from a seemingly dead civilization its world actually isnt too far off from that of horizon forbidden west just swapping robots for dastardly foxes the difference is that the setting doesnt stop kirby from treating it like his own personal playground and buffetkirby and the forgotten land is an adorable platformer cut from the same cloth as nintendos finest the games absurd mouthful mode is an especially strong gimmick that lets developer hal laboratory get more playful and comedic with the series it loses some steam when it runs out of ideas but its story and levels never fail to charm mekirby and the forgotten land is the first kirby game since the nintendo kirby the crystal shards but its not a radical reinvention of the series it still very much feels like a traditional kirby game and thats a good thing kirby has always been a secret weapon in nintendos firstparty arsenal providing smooth puzzleplatforming thats easy on the brain thats exactly what you get here with the game sharing more similarities to super mario worldthan super mario odysseyas always the game is built around kirbys insatiable appetite he can suck up enemies to gain new powers like fire breath bombs or the ability to take a long nap my favorite those can be used during linear platforming levels to solve puzzles that require using the right ability see something tangled up in a vine grab a sword or cutter to chop it down each level is filled with intuitive micropuzzles like that theyre never hard to figure out but always satisfying to executetheres added depth to that formula this time thanks to mouthful mode which allows kirby to suck up gigantic objects to comedic effect if kirby sucks up a vending machine he becomes a big pink rectangle that can shoot soda cans out of his mouth i laughed at every single one without failits not just a hysterical visual though its a practical mechanic too it lets the game create puzzles that arent just built around using a single ability in one room i need to light a fuse using fire power and get to a canon in time however theres a staircase sitting on the rope which extinguishes the flame i need to light it become the staircase which is an unbelievably funny visual and make my way around the fuse as it burns down then i need to get the staircase into a position that allows me to climb my way up to the canon in time its a clever little song and dance that tests my ability to juggle two abilities at oncethe main story is a hit of classic nintendo fun that checks all the right boxeskirby has needed a system like this for a while when i played the comparatively underwhelming kirby star allies i felt like i had done all of its puzzles before in some form even with its added multiplayer focus the simplest fuse lighting feels fresher here and much funnier to bootclocking in at around eight hours the main story is a hit of classic nintendo fun that checks all the right boxes solid bosses wellhidden secrets and tons of collectibles round the core package out to make this feel like the kind of nintendo game you grew up loving fun doesnt have to be fancywhat makes kirby and the forgotten land particularly stand out among a sea of platformers is its world in something like a mario game levels can feel a little random theyre built around a gameplay motif first and foremost so it rarely feels like youre walking around an actual cohesive world by contrast the titular forgotten land actually feels like a sensical space with its own secret historywhen i enter the obligatory ice world its not just a random collection of cold linear paths im walking through abandoned city streets and fighting bosses on a massive frozen suspension bridge what did this city used to be theres a continuity to the world that makes me actually want to know about it not just bounce around iteven with all of its dilapidated buildings the art direction radiates joyi get little bits and pieces of that story but the game lets me stay curious there are collectible gachapon toys that give little snippets of flavor text teasing the apocalypse that took place one figurine of a billboard tells me about an energy mega power that split up leading to countless heated corporate battles had i stumbled into a world where an exxonmobillike company caused the downfall of humanityi love that i never fully get that answer kirby and the forgotten land reminds me of a hayao miyazaki film in that way what ive always loved about ponyo for instance is that theres some sort of apocalyptic event happening in the background but its treated like a bplot instead the film spends most of its time watching its heroes joyfully eat ham as if nothing is happening theres room for peace amid the hysteria and thats how i feel when i see kirby doing his little dance every time he clears a leveleven with all of its dilapidated buildings the art direction radiates joy the colors are so pleasant that i couldnt care less about whether or not the switch can run visuals when kirby swallows an entire car the animation plays out with a kind of slapstick charm that takes me back to the days of watching cartoon network even the sound design like the plastic scuttling of kirbys red shoes gets a rise out of mein a high anxiety time where it feels like the forgotten land could become a preview of our own world kirby is the pink stress ball i needtheres a surprising amount of content packed into the package though it has its limits the games main sin is that it runs out of ideas halfway through the main story i collected every copy ability and saw almost every mouthful mode by world four after that i found myself fighting a lot of the same bosses and doing variations on the same puzzles until the endkirby and the forgotten land ultimately has an escalation problem when you write a comedy sketch you always need to heighten the gag until the very end you cant tell your best joke in the first few minutes but thats what happens here the game is at its best when its serving up new powers bosses and laughs it runs out of those eventually leaving it looking like a standup comedian who just got asked to fill another minutes they werent prepared forthe game does have a few workarounds for its eventual content stall the best among them is a power upgrade system which lets kirby buff his copy abilities they dont just get stronger they become entirely new tools when the traditional ice breath ability morphs kirby can use his breath to build snowmen and slide them over to an enemy the drilling ability that lets kirby burrow underground turns into a giant pencil that launches at enemies that system triples the number of powers in the game and adds a sense of progression when everything else starts slowing downwaddle dee town the games hub world that expands as kirby saves more waddle dee adds some needed variety while its small it contains a handful of simple minigames to cut through the repetition kirby can fish play a ballrolling game that uses the switchs gyroscopic controls and more most of the side activities are simple and can be fully completed in a few minutes but its a nice excuse to relax in a quaint space and listen to some tunesi collected every copy ability and saw almost every mouthful mode by world fourtheres a multiplayer option too but its a bit of a missed opportunity player two is very much a typical player two here while kirby gets to eat everything in sight his coop partner is a spearwielding waddle dee with a few unique attacks the camera is shared between both and only tracks kirby so its very much a sidekick role with no online option available its only something thatll really benefit parents and their kidseven with its repetitive late game i still enjoyed just about every second of kirby and the forgotten land in the games opening sequence kirby swallows a car and rides down a highway as a pop tune plays in one shot hes cruising against the clear blue sky as some seagulls fly by his window thats how i felt whenever i booted it up head empty soaking in the sunshine not a care in the worldkirby and the forgotten land is a delightful puzzleplatformer that adds more dimensions to the basic kirby formula mouthful mode isnt just a gimmick its a hysterical mechanic that deepens the puzzle potential the art direction is the star of the show turning basic platforming motifs into a creative world that always had me curious to see what awaited me in the next level the game stalls out once it stops presenting absurd new transformations but features like waddle dee town and ability upgrading give it some extra oomph during repetitive moments its a warm spring breeze for switch ownerssuper mario odyssey has a similar mechanic within a more robust game though kirby and the forgotten land is a notable improvement over the pink puffballs last switch outing kirby star alliesthe main story will take around eight to hours to complete theres a ton to collect and lots of side activities too which will likely double that time im at completion after hoursyes this is the best kirby game since the nintendo kirby planet robobot and a wonderful switch game for kids and the young at heartkirby and the forgotten land was tested on a nintendo switch oled in handheld mode and on a tcl

that was only hurting the studios under its banner its hypothetically good news for everyone involved though square enix is already in danger of making the same mistakesthe rise of square enix as gamings most eclectic publisher is a story years in the making it began in when square and enix joined forces in a landmark merger it was a match made in rpg heaven creating a new japanese megapower

square enix wasnt content with just being the king of one genre over the next decade the publisher would rapidly expand picking up companies like space invaders publisher taiko and creating new

that the surprise success of bravely default a traditional jrpg in the west had prompted a philosophical rethink at the company if you focus too much on the global aspect you might lose sight of who youre actually making the game for matsuda said at the timewhile the acquisition news is initially shocking it makes sense in context the writing has been on the wall for square enix europe since then as highprofile games like marvels avengers flopped it was becoming clear that square enix might be trying too hard to appeal to westerners the first sign that it was ready to cut that arm off the octopus came in when it decided to stop publishing games by io interactive allowing the independent studio to take the hitman series with it by selling off its three major western studios square enix has finished a job a decade in the makingthe news is a net positive for everyone in theory for the studios that were sold to embracer group its a potential blessing square enix wasnt doing them any favors as western games were becoming less of a priority talented studios like crystal dynamics have a better chance of avoiding mismanagement under a group like embracer so long as its committed to giving the studios its attention it could also mean that dormant ips like the legacy of kain could make a return which opens up some exciting possibilities for fansfor square enix it means the company can finally focus thats something it desperately needs to do especially after a string of highprofile failures like babylons fall and balan wonderworld the publishers unruly release schedule should be more manageable when it doesnt have to balance marketing massive marvel projects with the kind of surefire hits that it knows it can knock out of the park with its core audience globallyon paper its a winwin situation the question is whether or not square enix can actually settle down and theres good reason to believe history could repeat itself as part of the sale news the company announced that it will use the million its gaining to move forward in its investments in blockchain ai and the cloud that could be a potential red flag for the next decade for the companyof all those investments cloud tech is the one that makes the most sense square enix has long been a successful player in the mobile space and it has experimented with cloud tech as part of that move its also brought several of its games to nintendo switch as cloud versions recently so its not surprising to hear that its looking to bolster its foothold with the tech bringing its games to as many platforms and players as possibleblockchain presents a major question mark though square enix has shown great interest in the experimental tech as of late but mainstream gaming companies have yet to find success with it just look at ubisoft which is currently struggling to implement its nft service quartz it shuttered support for ghost recon breakpoint altogether months after adding nfts to the game theres a chance square enix is able to make a breakthrough with the tech but not without facing a hostile reaction from its valuable fan base the very players who kept the company afloat when its western expansion wasnt workingis square enix just going to pump money into another doomed business arm that doesnt make a return on investment and if it does is it really any better off than it is now square enix finds itself at a crucial crossroads if it plays its cards right it could bolster its position as a gaming giant by focusing on consistency but if its poorly supported gambles continue to fail the publisher could find itself looking for more bidders to snatch up the rest of the company soon enough,en,498,Positive

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/nintendo-switch-vs-switch-lite/,Nintendo Switch vs. Switch Lite,if you havent picked up the nintendo switch yet you now have two distinct options to choose from theres the original system which offers portability and docked television play alongside removable joycon controllers and theres the nintendo switch lite the smaller cheaper alternativethe switch lite is similar to the original handheld but features some significant design changes that might pique or quell your interest both are considerable choices but determining which is the best for you depends on what youre looking for weve broken down how each console differs to make your decision easier weve even rounded up the best nintendo switch dealsavailable nowsee morethe standard nintendo switch is a hybrid console it can be played as a handheld system or in tabletop mode with its included kickstand and as a home console when placed in its dock its power isnt its biggest selling point falling somewhere between the wii u and the standard xbox one and playstation consoles what makes the switch special is the many ways it can be used thoughoutside of its dock the switch functions as a typical handheld system a joycon controller is locked onto either side with the same button layout and sticks youd expect on a standard gamepad at any time however you can remove the joycon controllers and place the system in its dock and begin playing the system as a home console this switch happens instantly and you can remove the console from the dock to play as a handheld system just as swiftlythe switch lite doesnt have many of the features that make the switch unique and this is reflected in its reduced price the system doesnt come with a dock nor is there any way to connect it to a televisionthe controls on either side resemble the joycon controllers but they are a permanent part of the system its weight and screen size have both been reduced with the latter shrinking from inches to inches both systems have a screenhowever the biggest difference comes from the new custom tegra chip although its capabilities are nearly identical to the original switch its much more efficient leading to longer battery life in the switch lite up to hours nintendo quietly released a revision of the original switch with this new processor nearly double the battery life of the original console unfortunately the only way to tell if its a new switch is by the box and serial number if its a red box its the new switch likewise if the serial number starts with xkw its the new one outside of the new processor the two models are the samecloud saves are supported on the switch so long as you have a nintendo switch online subscription so youll likely be able to access your game progress across both systems in that way there is a selection of games like pokmon lets go however that dont have cloud saving enabledas for the ability to transfer data between the two devices its possible though not instantaneously just as you would do going from one switch to another you can transfer your entire account to the switch lite if you want to pick one up however you cant go back and forth unless you transfer your profile manually each timethe original nintendo switch comes with two joycon controllers in the basic package as well as the joycon grip when attached to the switch the joycon controllers function identically to how the controls work on the switch lite when detached however you have far more optionsturned sideways one joycon controller can be used on its own much like a classic nes gamepad and buttons inside the rail portion can be raised with the included joycon straps this lets you essentially play a twoplayer game wherever you are such as mario kart deluxeor new super mario bros u deluxeif you place both joycon controllers in the joycon grip they resemble the look and feel of a traditional gamepad and this is the primary way to play games while docked unless you purchase a pro controllerthough the switch lite does support these controllers via bluetooth connection its own controls are not detachable as such you will need to purchase at least one joycon controller to play the system with a friend as well as a stand to place it down since the kickstand found on the standard switch has been removed from the switch litestill the fixed controls do mean the switch lite gets a fullfledged directional pad for certain platforming games that demand precise jumps this could make the switch lite the preferred option at least among those who do not want to play their games on a tvone type of controller that will apparently not be supported by the switch lite at all is the gamecube controller an adapter is available to use this controller on the standard switch but it connects via a usb port on the dock rather than directly to the console no dock with the switch lite no usb portthe nintendo switch and the nintendo switch lite play almost the same library of games and with the proper accessories you can achieve complete parity between the two systems out of the box however there are afew titles you cannot enjoy on the switch litesuper mario party can only be played in either tabletop or docked mode because it makes heavy use of the joycon controllers unique motion features the same is true for launch title switch which utilizes hd rumble for some of its minigameswithout buying a few joycon controllers and a grip to keep them charged these games will not work on switch lite they can run without extra joycons but theyre not exactly playable certain modes also will be inaccessible in other games you wont be able to use motion controllers to flick your pok ball in pokmon lets go for instancethe other major incompatibility with switch lite is nintendo labo the graphics are programmed to fit the original switch so the sets dont look right on the switch lite labo also uses joycon controllers which arent compatible with the switch lite that means the vr modes added to the legend of zelda breath of the wild and super mario odyssey wont be available to switch lite ownersthere are plenty of incredible cases skins and screen protectors designed specifically for the nintendo switch lite because its tinier than the switch the conventional accessories wont fit well on the latest device still they cant match the classic nintendo switchs massive number of accessories several of which are not supported by the switch lite cases screen shields and guard shells for instance will all be too massive there are a few items that will work well though like headsets using a input and control stick coversthe regular nintendo switch system is available now the sale value is but its usually much cheaper when theres a sale going on such as prime day and black friday the regular system comes in dark gray or neon red and blue colors with picturesque special edition consoles making their way on the scene toothe switch lite is is available in a variety of fun and different colors like coral yellow gray and turquoise a special edition for pokmon sword and shield was released quickly following the launch

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/grid-legends-review/,"Grid Legends review: Driven, but derivative",grid legends is like the kind of car one buys out of necessity its not a beautiful sports car to flaunt to others like a gran turismo game or a sturdy and robust vehicle that can handle anything offroading throws at you like a forza horizon game its that car that will get you to work every day but not be something you show off to friends and familyfrom graphics to sound to gameplay grid legends is perfectly adequate the developers know the game is acceptable in these areas so it tries to stand out with a unique approach to its narrative developer codemasters has always cared more about the story in its racing games than its competitors grid legends is the culmination of that as its story mode is a liveaction documentary about an underdog racing teamwhile using this framing device for its narrative is innovative the driven to glory storyline ultimately falls flat grid legends is simply an enjoyable if underwhelming racing game overshadowed by the new forza horizon and gran turismo games it is being released betweengrid legends features everything players have come to expect from a racing game there are over tracks spread across the world and more than cars of every type across notable brands to drive on them these arent the highestfidelity car models and there isnt a vast open world to explore but it isnt ugly players looking for a standard racing game wont have a bad timethere are several different race types that players will experience over the driven to glory story campaign and the career mode where players complete races and sponsor challenges to earn currency and gain new abilities stat boosts and cars the standout race type is elimination a mode where the drivers in last place are disqualified at certain intervals so players fight to be at the front of the pack for as long as possibleit sounds good and plays fine but there are very few things grid legends does better than any other racing gamegrid legends is not as arcadelike as forza horizon and its not an overly punishing simulation that will doom the player if they brake too hard at the wrong time and even if the player does mess up theres a handy flashbacks feature to rewind time up to three times in a race it sounds good and plays fine but there are very few things grid legends does better than any other racing gamegrid legends ace in the hole is that it does a fantastic job at making players feel like they earn their victories it features a nemesis system not that one that tracks whether the player gets a little too aggressive and is constantly bumping into and cutting off other drivers if they are particularly aggressive toward an ai driver that driver will remember and get revenge by cutting the player off and being aggressive later in the racethis makes the player have to account for aggressive driver tendencies from ai even though thats an experience often reserved for multiplayer in racing games and for those interested grid legends features robust crossplatform multiplayer that players can drop in and out of at any timethe best moments in the campaign and the career mode were when i started at the back of the pack and had to fight my way to the front dealing with the nemesis system and commanding my teammate driver along the waygrid legends ace in the hole is that it does a fantastic job at making players feel like they earn their victoriesgrid legends will make players remember individual drivers with this system even if they are faceless ai characters so its not too surprising that codemasters wanted to go one step further and put faces and personalities to those names unfortunately codemasters does not fully pull that offthe idea of a sports or racing games narrative presenting itself as a documentary seems very promising the documentary format is unique from most games and allows the gameplay and interviews to not get in each others way even though they are tied together i could see games like madden or fifa successfully implementing a story mode like thisunfortunately grid legends wouldnt make for a very good documentarydriven to glory follows the story of seneca a team in the fictional grid world series making a lastditch effort to win a championship and keep the lights on to do so seneca must rely on a new unproven driver and overtake ravenwest a scummy team with cocky drivers and owners unfortunately grid legends never digs deeper than thatthe biggest disservice to the narrative is that the player is a nonfactorthis is a simple underdog story that will never shock the player with plot developments or twists even if the featured performances are solid codemasters also boasted filming using the same extended reality tech used on the mandalorian but there are only a few locations so it doesnt feel much different than if the studio just used practical setsthe biggest disservice to the narrative is that the player is a nonfactor despite how important driver is to the story the fictional documentarians never thought itd be a good idea to interview that person itd be like if the documentary val barely featured val kilmer and referred to him as batman the whole timethankfully the documentary format does make some of the other drivers memorable it also pairs well with the nemesis system as drivers like ravenwests nate mckane will be aggressive in races after trashing the player in an interview ncuti gatwa from netflixs sex education is having a lot of fun as driver valentin manzi but hes severely underused and not relevant to the plot at allthis story probably may have been better served had he taken the mantle of driver and breathed life into the fake docs narrative core or if it was more reactive to the players actions ultimately the use of liveaction here limits the adventures just as much as it adds realism the ending does teases a sequel so i hope codemasters learns from the shortcomings of grid legends because the documentary framing is an excellent ideagrid legends doesnt have the prettiest graphics or most expansive worlds in the racing game genre its documentaryframed story also isnt as much of a revolution for the series as codemasters likely had hoped still solid mechanics like the nemesis system ensure that racing game fans will enjoy the game even though there definitely isnt a lack of options right now this is a commuter vehicle not a luxury sports carforza horizon is available on xbox game pass and gives players a vast open world to explore as for those looking for a hardcore simulation grid legends will only be the new hotness for a week before gran turismo launches on march the driven to glory story mode took sixandahalf hours to beat though i did have to retry a couple of levels beyond that a lengthy career mode with lots of challenges and a fleshedout online experience could keep players hooked for several more hours if they dont move on to other racing gamesyes but those still playing forza horizon or waiting for gran turismo shouldnt feel bad about skipping it,en,478,Positive

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/moss-book-2-review/,Moss: Book 2 review: Modest VR mouse becomes mighty,moss book is proof that small changes can have a big impact though the first moss game was hailed as an early vr killer app it was a touch thin on ideas its simple swordswinging combat got repetitive fast and its puzzles largely revolved around the same set of basic interactions its short runtime made up for its mechanical shortcomings but there was plenty of room to growdeveloper polyarc has risen to that challenge with its sequel available now on ps vr while it looks and feels identical to its predecessor at first glance the latest chapter steadily peppers in new ideas that help the series reach its potential the original looked to bring adventure game fundamentals to vr but the sequel feels more akin to more modern games like ori and the will of the wispsnew combat options abilities and tactile interactions elevate moss book above a vr proof of concept the experience isnt much longer than the original but the added variety makes a fouryearold game feel brand new againmoss book picks up right where its predecessor left off players once again control quill an adorable white mouse who adventures through dioramalike worlds players are simultaneously controlling another character in firstperson the godlike reader who can move large objects and heal quill from afar both of those characters have more abilities this time around deepening the interplay between themthe slow drip of new tools keeps fights from getting repetitiveon the mouse side the most notable difference comes in the form of combat quills toolset was extremely limited in the original moss with battles largely revolving around simple sword slashes against the same handful of enemies polyarc has added more weapons to the game including a boomeranglike chakram and a slow but powerful hammerin addition to those new tools each weapon has a special power thats activated by holding the attack button and touching quill as the reader the swords special power allows quill to quickly zip forward while the hammer readies a phantom copy of itself that the reader can detonate at any time those special skills add more variety to battles fixing the first games biggest flaw the sequel still lacks in enemy variety but the slow drip of new tools keeps fights from getting repetitivethe only problem with the new system is its implementation to equip a weapon players open up a radial menu as the reader and drag it over to quill i found myself locked in a clumsy juggling act in later fights as i tried to quickly swap weapons on the fly and activate a charged ability before an enemy could hit me all while still dodging around as quill its particularly strange because most of the dualshocks face buttons go unused here all three primary weapons could have been mapped to the face buttons letting players attack more fluidlyeven with the games small improvements i still find space for it to grow in book reader gets some new tricks too which similarly cut down the tedious moments of the original by the end of the first moss i grew a little sick of dragging boxes and enemies around the screen puzzles are less of a onetrick pony here as polyarc created a more tactile world that puts vr controls to better usefor instance the reader can grow climbable walls by waving their hand over withered vines or create paths by connecting plants together powers like that bring a double dose of gratification like the original moss book plays out in a series of zeldalike puzzle dioramas with consistently clever solutions the addition of more varied interactivity on top of that makes the puzzles feel like a series of satisfying fidget toysthose systems meld together with quills new tools to lend the sequel extra complexity some rooms had me spinning cans and manipulating enemy attacks as the reader while using quills charged chakram shot to break progressblocking barriers while that kind of multitasking can be difficult in combat its much better suited to the games methodical puzzles which rarely ask the players to do the same trick twicemoss book is a singleplayer adventure but there were times when it felt like i was playing with a close friendi especially adore each of the games boss fights which toy with the interplay further in one fight im battling a giant hammerwielding knight that towers over quill when he smashes his hammer down i grab the head as the reader and engage in a game of tug of war giving quill also controlled by me a moment to attack while there are only a few big battles they act as a thrilling test of the players skillsquill and the readers dynamic isnt just a mechanical one the surprisingly tearjerking story is built around the relationship between the two its one thing to be told two characters need each other its another to actually feel it play out in rooms that neither character can navigate alone moss book is a singleplayer adventure but there were times when it felt like i was playing with a close friendwhen i finished the first moss i was left feeling a little indifferent about the series future i enjoyed my time with it but didnt feel like there was much more ground to cover after book im already itching for a sequel on playstation thats a testament to how comfortable with its creation polyarc seems this time around the worldbuilding is more confident with a mix of grand lore and more personal character relationships that nearly drew some tears from me thankfully in vr no one can see you crythere are moments where it feels like the game stops just as its getting on a rolllevel design especially benefits from the sequel treatment while the first moss largely played out in a fairly standard fantasy setting book world feels more ambitious at times id turn my head to see a giant tower looming in the distance giving me a sense of scale that i never felt the first time around polyarc even saves its best twist for last with a mindbending setpiece pulled from m c eschers playbookthat particular segment is a relatively short one that left me wanting more which was a running theme throughout my adventure i appreciate that polyarc makes lean games that dont overstay their welcome but there are moments where it feels like the game stops just as its

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/elden-ring-best-talismans/,The best Talismans in Elden Ring,there are so many ways to augment your character inelden ring outside of simply leveling up when it comes down to it what you have equipped can make a bigger difference to your stats than well even your stats themselves between your weapon shield armor and consumable items you can turn a decent build into an overpowered beast that can crush a boss as easily as a simple mob in past souls games one of the most important parts of any characters build was collecting and equipping the best rings to buff up the right stats or give a muchneeded advantage in one aspect or another while rings are gone for elden ring they have been replaced with the nearly identical talismanstalismans are functionally identical to rings you start out with just two slots to fill but can eventually max out at four there are far more than four talismans in the game of course so you will need to pick and choose which are the most important for your character to wear at any time or for any situation some are good essentially all the time while others are more situational and others still will never have a purpose for your run with dozens to find across the lands between it can be hard to nail down which are the best ones we scoured the map and ran the numbers to pin down the best talismans in elden ring you need to pick upthe best talisman almost universally is radagons soreseal if you just look at the description you might think it isnt worth it because of how vague the wording is the description just says it greatly raises attributes but also increases damage taken which probably sounds like a bad deal in reality the word greatly is incredibly understated what this talisman really does is increase your vigor endurance strength and dexterity by a massive five levels when equipped thats right just wearing this one talisman is equivalent to leveling up times what about that increase in damage taken well you will take about more damage from all sources but the amount of hp youre getting from it alone basically negates that downside the only player this wouldnt be a good deal for is spell and miraclefocused builds but if youre swinging just about anything radagons soreseal will make you hit harder have more stamina and increased hp just be careful with it as you approach soft and hard level caps thoughradagons soreseal can be picked up in fort faroth in caelid you need to get all the way to the bottom take a ladder up cross the roof and drop down a hole to find itthis next pick is again more for builds that use some kind of melee option though might still be worth it for other builds too the green turtle talisman is one of those talismans that once you use it will be hard to give up what it does is increase the speed at which your stamina recovers think of the grass crest shield from dark souls only as a talisman instead of a shield it boosts the recovery speed by eight points which probably doesnt mean anything to you as a number but once you actually see it youll realize how drastic that increased speed is when you need to squeeze out an extra roll or need just one more swing to finish off a boss you can even stack this effect with the other turtlethemed item the green turtle shell to further drop your stamina recovery timethis talisman is found in a chest underneath summonwater village but requires the use of a stonesword key to unlock a fog gate to accesswhile not quite on the level of radagons soreseal the erdtrees favor especially the version can work as a decent alternative or complement this talisman is a straightup increase to your vigor stamina and equip load if you get the version youre getting about more hp just under stamina and equip load because theyre percentagebased this talisman scales with your character unlike most others that give a flat numerical buff while still best for meleeminded characters hp stamina and even equip load are stats that every build could use more of so theres room for this talisman no matter what character youre runningthe basic version of erdtrees favor is found in the fingefolk heros cave locked away behind a fog gate you need to use a stonesword key to breakthrough the version comes much later when you make it all the way down into the subterranean shunninggrounds but is protected by the boss mohg the omen who is quite tough on his own the version is even harder to get once you make it all the way to lyndell ashen capital a lategame area go to the forbidden lands site of grace here you need to either manage to beat three ulcerated tree spirits even one of which is a tough customer or find a way to sprint past them and loot the erdtrees favor before getting demolisheddont worry magic users we didnt forget about you marikas soreseal is the sorcery and faith equivalent to what radagons soreseal is for strength and dexterity this time the talisman will give you five points in mind intelligence arcane and faith again the equivalent of levels but at the cost of taking more damage again that amount of extra damage is however we do have to rank it lower regardless of if youre a magic and miracle build because it doesnt offset that damage with any increase to hp ideally you wouldnt be getting hit with this build anyway but intelligence and faith builds are already somewhat glass cannons by default so unless youre confident in your ability to dodge and avoid getting touched the risk with this talisman is slightly higher than the otherthis is another lategame talisman unfortunately you need to reach the secret optional zone called the haligtree at the end of the consecrated snowfields once there navigate the treacherous zone until you get to the prayer room site of grace right off this room is a fog gate thats locked by two stonesword keys making it quite the investment to pick upstick with talismans built for intelligence builds we have the gravenmass talisman this is a nobrainer for anyone who casts sorceries as their primary method of attack since its effect is to simply greatly increase the potency of sorceries gain elden ring likes to keep the exact stats hidden but its been worked out that this talisman makes your sorcery damage go up by a nice just like the erdtrees favor that makes the gravenmass talisman more and more effective as you level up since that percentage increase will just get bigger over timethis is another tougher to get talisman first you will need to access the consecrated snowfields and navigate the snowy terrain to the albinuraic rise tower on the east side of the map this tower like all the others wont open until you solve a little puzzle in this case you can do one of two things to solve it one requires you to use a bewitching branch item on either one of the pair of imp statues just outside bringing it to life and attacking the other or if you have the fanged imp ashes you can just summon them to achieve the same effect once the seal is broken just enter the tower and claim your rewardradagon always seems to have the best stuff while his first appearance was leaning toward melee characters this one is fully focused on spell casters it isnt so much an overpowered talisman by itself but a very welcome addition to your other spellfocused build what the radagon icon does is cut the casting time for all your incantations and spells down by a massive margin unfortunately this is another one you kind of need to feel to experience since the casting time will be shortened different amounts on a spell per spell basis but rest assured those bigger more flashy incantations and spells with giant leadups will feel way better to use do note however that this talisman doesnt affect the speed of scarlet aeonia or dragonrelated incantationsthe radagon icon is in the second main dungeon in elden ring the academy of raya lucaria once you beat the miniboss halfway through and open up the debate parlor site of grace head into the following crumbling plaza and hug the right side hop over a fence and up a ladder to find the item in a chest along this upper walkwayweve talked about some talismans that could be used for most builds but typically favor at least one style over the other at least somewhat the gold scarab talisman is one that without a doubt each and every player of elden ring could make use of well as long as you get it before you beat the game of course this finely crafted golden talisman boosts the number of runes you earn for every enemy you slay by we obviously dont need to tell you have valuable runes are acting as both currency and xp for leveling up and how annoying it can be if you ever need to farm them can be a massive increase in rewards for higherlevel enemies or if youre confident enough to equip it during a boss battle youll be really reaping the rewards you might not want to wear it all the time but its an amazing tool you should certainly have ready if you need to quickly earn some currency or xpto get this excellent farming tool head to the abandoned cave in the caelid region which is to the southeast of the minor erdtree on the map this cave is full of scarlet rot so be quick or have some items ready to cure it the duo of cleanrot knights is your boss at the end manage to beat them both and the gold scarab talisman will be yoursthis pick came down to two choices for us but we went with the claw talisman over the curved sword talisman for a few reasons what they do is increase the strength of all your jumping attacks and your guard counters respectively the reason we like the claw talisman more or essentially jump attacks is because they tend to be more versatile and less risky yes guard counters are kind of the easy less risky version of a parry and riposte but still have two downsides in our eyes one is that not every person uses a shield and the second is that theyre still pretty risky unless you know for sure that an enemy isnt going to attack again you can easily open yourself up to damage by fishing for a guard counter this is especially true for bosses that dont really break their strings on your blockjumping attacks on the other hand are not free you still need to time them but theyre fully in your control rather than reactionary not only that but theyre even a bit safer to pull off since jumping in on an opponent can occasionally dodge low and sweeping attacks plus for most weapons anyway you recover a lot faster from a jumping attack than a guard counter but if youre confident in your timing feel free to grab the curved sword talismanthe claw talisman can be picked up nice and early in stormveil castle from the rampart tower site of grace take a plunge off the roof carefully of course to a lower tower you can climb up with the talisman waiting at the top the curved sword talisman for reference is also in stormveil castle this time you need to head down to the deepest levels of the castle where you fight the banished knight which is near the start of the dungeon after taking the secret entrance once you get past margit the knight is guarding a chest with this talisman insideone good complementary talisman to either of the prior ones or just your general heavy weapons build is the bullgoats talisman it has a simple effect increase your poise now poise has been an odd stat in fromsoftware games changing in importance and function from game to game in elden ring it is thankfully pretty simple poise is almost exclusively tied to what kind of armor youre wearing with heavier armors granting higher poise there are few consumables that can also increase it but for the most part its all about your armor or this talisman what poise actually does is reduce the chance you will flinch or be interrupted while trying to do something like attack if you get hit while doing that action basically the higher your poise the less likely you are to finish that big swing even if the enemy hits youthe bullgoats talisman increases whatever poise you have by about again we love percentagebased buffs since they scale so well as you go through the game and get better heavier armors with more poise the talisman will keep getting better right along with you if youre going to be tanking hits knowing that yours will hurt more than theirs you will need all the poise you can getthe bullgoats talisman is in a pretty treacherous location you will need to brave the dragonbarrow cave which reaching means avoiding plenty of dragons once inside you need to fight or avoid a giant bear and snatch it off a corpselast up we cant blame anyone for throwing on the crimson amber medallion when you have a spare slot you dont know what to do with this medallion comes in the base form which you can even get as a starting gift and the and variants each of them is a straight buff to your max hp with the base form giving you an extra for the and for once again we have to give it up for a scaling item that will never get outleveled but it is still a relatively boring talisman compared to others still if the worst thing we have to say about it is that it only gives you hp the most valuable resource you have in elden ring then thats quite a complimentthe base version of the crimson amber medallion can either be taken as a starting gift or purchased from the nomadic merchant on the east end of the weeping peninsula for runes the version cant be obtained until you hit volcano manor from the prison town church site of grace head through the town and enter the blocked area using a stonesword key avoid the enemy and run up the stairs to loot the talisman finally for the best version you will need to wait until you hit lyndell captial of ash and defeat maliketh from the site of grace of the same name drop down into the sewers onto the wooden beam and collect it,en,784,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/missed-games-pax-east-2022/,6 must-see indie games we saw at PAX East 2022,pax east is officially back and some hidden gems have arrived with it the kind of games on display at a pax show may not be bigbudget blockbusters but they pack a surprising punch that might just convert a couple of gamers to the indie side the expo hall was filled with independent games both old and new though there were some clear highlights on the busy show floor here are six eyecatching games we saw at pax east throttle was only playable in a small arcade cabinet located at devolver digitals booth and it very much fits that medium its a retro shooter in the same vein as ikaruga but with a little more comedy you control a cowboy and a vampiress each of whom has a score to settle with a demon the two have different weapons and bombs giving them each their own distinct feel on the constantly scrolling battlefieldthe games standout feature is something you usually dont see in these kinds of games verticality you can jump up onto higher terrain levels or drop to lower ones to dodge bullets or collect pickups terrain can also be blown away to reveal hidden pickups so i progressed through the game leveling the world as i went along still none of those pickups helped when i faced the games bosses which crushed me demon throttle is shaping up to be the perfect challenge for fans of those oldschool bullet hell games while also providing something freshdevolver digitals cult of the lamb stands out as a morbid roguelike city builder starring cartoon critters you should expect to lose at least some of them though a possessed lamb creates a cult in the name of an unknown god in exchange for another life once sacrificed in a ritual it is resurrected with the help of the gods red crown and slaughters its persecutors before escaping to start a cult next screw the other gods and their followers by becoming the ultimate culteach gameplay loop starts like this the lamb enters a dungeon to beat up monsters forage for ingredients and find followers dungeons work like your typical roguelike with randomized rooms that might hold anything from mini bosses to prophets you might even get a helpful powerup to help brute force your way through the dungeon after a run ends players indoctrinate new followers and take care of them to cultivate their cult in the process they might even find a way to free the one who waitswrestlequest was tucked away in the corner of the boston convention and exhibition center during pax east but it may as well have had a massive sign pointing at it the games energy much like the wrestlers in it is larger than life the elevator pitch is that wrestlequest combines jrpg mechanics and wrestling battles are turnbased players can perform special moves that require mp and theres a massive overworld to venture across thats littered with dungeonswhile the game has some of the usual downsides that come with the jrpg territory like way way too much dialogue it still provides some nice wrinkles that speed things along in combat for instance players can call on their manager to apply a buff or debuff and players have to mind a hype meter showing the crowds excitement otherwise theyll deal less damage wrestlequest still has a ways to go its demo had some bugs and wonky animations but fans of jrpgs wrestling or both should find something they like in iteiyuden chronicles rising is actually a prequel to another one of rabbit bears upcoming games eiyuden chronicles hundred of heroes thanks to a hefty kickstarter surplus it was able to announce both at once talk about efficiency in rising an adventurer named cj ventures to the town of new nevaeh as a treasure hunter but finds out itll be harder than she expects she eventually teams with other heroes to take on more challenging quests and play out the prewar backstories of hundred of heroes characterseiyuden chronicles rising is a sidescrolling rpg meaning you can only move side to side and jump as necessary characters work similarly to how they do in fantasy rpgs with their own unique abilities that players will need to switch between effectively to best bosses plus its colorful detailed artwork and expressive sprites can appeal to those who enjoy pixelated rpgs like classic final fantasy games and more modern counterpartsnote these games are also developed with a refreshing amount of humor one of the first quests features a fluffy white cat that doesnt attack you even when you hold it up like a rag dollthere were lots of roguelikes at pax east but none quite like shoulders of giants unlike cult of the lamb its not a hybrid game that smashes genres together instead the hook is that players pretty much control two characters instead of just one the first is a giant robot armed with a sword that can wallop enemies while the other is the robots driver a small frog armed with a laser pistolruns are differentiated by the new abilities for each of those characters that players can pick up each of which can make destroying the games monsters a breeze a missile launcher for the frog for instance locked straight onto three enemies and vaporized them some abilities are goofier though with one for the robot summoning three trucks that run over any enemies in their path while i only played one

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-release-date-trailer-gameplay-news/,Everything we know about Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes,for most people their introduction to the fire emblem series was a pair of weirdly outofplace smash bros characters wielding swords originally a japanexclusive the series got a slow start gaining popularity in the west but by the time fire emblem three houses hit the nintendo switch the series had become one of the most popular tactics titles with a dash of life sim ever released most titles in this series are distinct from one another not all that unlike the final fantasy series but considering just how popular the setting and characters established in fire emblem three houses were a followup of sorts makes perfect senserevealed during a massive nintendo direct in february fire emblem warriors three hopes is looking to be the equivalent of what hyrule warriorswas to the zelda games or perhaps more accurately what persona strikerswas to persona for all the fans that only recently joined in on the main series and dont know what the warriors tag means for the series or anyone who has been following the series for years and wants to know whats in store with this next entry heres everything we know about fire emblem warriors three hopesfire emblem warriors three hopes is right on the horizon despite only just being revealed in february the game is already slated to be released on june this has become somewhat of a trend for nintendo to announce and release games in short order and we appreciate not being forced to wait years for games were excited aboutfire emblem warriors three hopes as with mainline every entry in this series is coming exclusively to the nintendo switch none of the mainline games have ever seen a release on any other platform so dont hold out hope of this game coming to pc or any other console unfortunatelythe announcement trailer opens with some imagery of armies marching and views of the world of fodlan before we see our first familiar face byleth we then get a flashy montage of sorts where we see a handful of characters in battle including edelgard dmitir and claude using some special moves and mowing down dozens of enemies in typical warriors fashion each character gives a few lines of dialogue we cant really glean much from regarding the goingson but thankfully other sources give more insight into the plot of the gamefire emblem warriors three hopes will consist of four story paths you as byleth can progress down based on the choices you make despite taking place in the same place and with the same characters as fire emblem three houses the events of that game wont impact the story of fire emblem warriors three hopes based on the trailer and the new antagonist that seems to be the main focus of conflict some speculate that the three houses will team up against this new threat even though we do see them engaged in combat in the trailer how you choose to interact with the other houses might be some of the decisions that impact which story path you followthe mysterious mercenary trailer showcases more of what appears to be the main antagonist of fire emblem warriors three hopes called the ashen demon first though we are finally introduced to our main protagonist canonically named shez but both their name and gender can be changed they are shown off most prominently wielding dual swords this trailer also explicitly states that there will be three paths to choose from each represented by one of the three houses you can align yourself with shez will go from an unlikely mercenary to a hero destined to take down this ashen demon in a twist the trailer ends with you having the ability to select the ashen demons form either a male or female byletha whole new suite of footage of characters was revealed starting with scarlet blaze an axwielding knight aligned with the adrestian empire next is azure gleam fighting with a lance from the holy kingdom of faerghus golden wildfire is a ranger riding a small drake from the leicester alliancewhether youre a fan of it or not fire emblem warriors three hopes is following that triedandtrue warriorsstyle gameplay for the most part on the field you can expect to take control of one maybe multiple characters from fire emblem three houses and travel through massive battlefields completing objectives leveling up and cutting down hundreds upon hundreds of grunts in your path you will have special moves that can deal damage in wide areas longrange over long distances and more unique to each characterthere will also be mounts which is not a new addition to the formula except that dragons will be rideable this gives the character tons of mobility and presumably brand new moves as well speaking of giant monsters we also see a few massive beasts that you will need to contend with that look like the bossstyle enemies seen in hyrule warriors for this gamethe trailer also showed a small glimpse at the battle map portion of the game this shows the regions you have control over areas you need to conquer and some more details on them one shown off in the trailer was called prepare for the conquest of garreg mach which had an enemy level of an objective of clear a path for the conquest of garreg mach by defeating the church of seiros army and separate rewards for getting an s rank and a capture rewardwe can also see merchants pop up on the map screen where you can trade gold for different items these seem to be fixed areas on the map that you can visit once youve conquered that regionbefore a fight you will be able to outfit your characters with equipment which also shows all the stats of that weapons skills and abilities and change their class there is also a fully explorable camp area where you can train with your allies to gain new classesx or just hang out and enjoy a meal with each otheron the field like past warriors games you can issue orders to characters youre not controlling to send them toward different objectives while you tackle others or to meet up to join forces somewhere on the map this will let you use partner special moves that combine the best of both characters movesin terms of playable characters warriors games often have a very extensive cast to pick from for now however we only know of a select few that will be playable in fire emblem warriors three hopes based on the trailer we know that edelgard dimitri claude and byleth are confirmed to be playable but we also see different versions of each of them that might count as completely different characters we also expect that byleth will have both a male and female form to pick from as well if the previous fire emblem warriors initial roster is anything to go by which had at launch plus nine more added later theres still plenty of room for surprises on this rosterwhile the trailer didnt say we can thank the game box for fire emblem warriors three hopes to confirm that it will allow for both one and two players this is almost certainly a coop mode as has been common for just about every warriors game that does include multiplayer and would feel right at home on this switch version according to the details from retailers multiplayer will be limited to local play only meaning you cant join or host online sessions with friendsno dlc plans have been made at this time but the warriors games especially ones partnered with nintendo have very good track records for providing plenty of dlc new characters can almost be assumed to be added if not more modes maps and more the amount of content each warriors game gets is almost too much at times so you can feel safe getting your moneys worth out of fire emblem warriors three hopespreorders are up on most major retailers for physical and digital editions of the game gamestop and targetboth have them for your normal retail price of though there is a limited edition floating around that for now looks exclusive to european markets this edition includes the fire emblem warriors three hopes game an art book tapestry map five acrylic figurines and a character postcard hopefully we in the west get a chance to get our hands on this addition as well but for now only the basic version looks to be available well keep you updated should that

if players can stomach stumbling through the game to learn the basics without tutorials and ignore frame dropsrune factory is the latest game in the rune factory series which originated as a fantasy harvest moon spinoff its previous release was rune factory special a nintendo switch remaster of the original rune factory for the nintendo fans have been waiting for ages for a new generation long enough that this should be a big deal for those who enjoyed previous titlesrune factory continued to impress me with its endless entertainment which i noted in my preview however the flaws didnt really improve nonetheless its progression system and characters kept me invested enough to keep playinglike all rune factory titles this one starts with an amnesiac protagonist who wakes up on the outskirts of rigbarth the protagonist the male ares or female alice wakes up to save hina a little girl who has wandered into a dangerous area outside of town she leads the hero over to rigbarth where the villagers inspect the protagonist before recruiting them as an agent for seed the local task force your job then becomes to farm crops tame monsters fulfill requests from townspeople capture wanted criminals and so ontheres plenty to juggle including completing the main plot raising skills and bonding with your favorite townspeopleplayers can focus on a number of aspects of the game depending on what kind of player they are one can start dominating their fields with seeds right away or build bunches of barns to house as many monsters as possible meanwhile others can cash in on pricey catches from fishing venturestheres plenty to juggle including completing the main plot raising skills and bonding with your favorite townspeople it never felt like i was stagnating and theres nearconstant progression thanks to the skill bars for almost everything including cooking and sleepingfarming is one of the first skills that a townsperson will walk players through its simple at first but once crops hit level four players need to enrich the soil to grow higherlevel crops as players progress through the game they learn other skills like how to fish and tame monsters each skill has layers that make them more advantageous and build on one another for example taming monsters leads to recruiting them allowing players to collect important drops and in turn raise a monsters friendship level to acquire higherlevel drops think betterquality eggs from your chicken friends depending on how much they like youanother major element of the game is romance which eventually leads to marriage including samesex unions and children players can choose between six bachelors and six bachelorettes marriage candidates and townspeople in general greatly differ in terms of personality so each one feels unique and caters to different tastes unfortunately theres not much variation in terms of skin color or body type for the candidates so it might not cater to players looking for a more diverse dating sim experienceeach skill has layers that make them more advantageous and build on one anotherits easy enough to raise friendship levels and romance levels through daily conversation giftgiving and exploring together with your ideal candidate i raised martin to heart level seven by the first week of summer thanks to a steady stream of gifts and adventuring invitesrune factory has serveral difficulty levels which can be cranked up to make a playthrough more challenging but even then it shouldnt be difficult to beat a boss headon without worrying about the quality of equipment or gear i didnt experiment much with strengthening weapons or equipment though the game gives players that option that easy difficulty is a shame considering the game allows up to four people or animals in a party you probably wont need the help though you should bring them anyway to raise friendship levelsin farming sims and similar games players might feel disappointed if the days are too short to complete everything they need to thankfully rune factory days can span over a full hour in real life some might prefer sleeping as early as pm or the moment they run out of rune points the energy they use to complete tasks like cooking or chopping wood however its also possible to keep eating food or visit the hot springs to replenish energy so that busy bees could keep working until the wee hours of the night perhaps its not recommended but i hate to waste the time i could spend grinding for more materialsin my preview i noted how the game didnt clearly explain what i had to do to build a monster barn after playing this game for hours ive found that the ambiguous instructions continue even further into the game sure it tells you how to farm and how to learn new recipes with bread however it doesnt clearly explain many other basics like where to find the fertilizer bin or the fact that theres a delivery port inside your room but your wardrobe blocks it so you need to move it to have any chance of having items conveniently delivered to your house there are redditors already asking these questions while playing the japanese versionive found that the ambiguous instructions continue even further into the gamethe problem should be less pronounced for those already familiar with the series just based on features that carry over from past titles i often looked up rune factory guides to make educated guesses about how to do tasks which i shouldnt need to do but it helped me nonethelessrune factory also didnt impress me with its visuals which noticeably have more empty space than ever in rigbarth and dungeons backgrounds have more of a bland painted look without much detail if people ended up caring about rune factory as much as pokemon legends arceus they would flip over its flat lookframe stutters noticeably appear while moving about the map especially the town some hiccups like crops disappearing for brief moments at a time until they render or character icons spawning in the water will happen it doesnt significantly detract from the gameplay but its present enough to be considered a flawim still playing and enjoying rune factory but i wish it were even better than it is its a satisfying followup to the series mostly in terms of the freedom in romance and skill leveling however the fact that it fails to explain even the bare basics of the game to beginners and returning fans along with a number of other flaws makes it difficult to recommend to newcomers i hope to see improvements in the rune factory series that make its more traditional counterparts as stable as the ones and enough explanations throughout the game to make it more convenient for newcomers in the futureif you really want a good farming simulator with lots to do including romance stardew valley is still the cream of the croprune factory can last hundreds of hours im already clocked in at around hours for finishing the main plot around hours is a decent estimate though expect to play moreyes rune factory should appeal to longtime fans or those who like games that overlap between a couple of categories including farming sims dating sims and jrpgs i cant see it having much mainstream appeal though due to the barriers it puts up for newcomersrune factory was tested on nintendo switch,en,568,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/digimon-survive-release-date-trailer-gameplay-news/,Everything we know about Digimon Survive,while often seen as a mere shadow underneath the massive titan that is the pokemon franchise digimon has evolved or rather digivolved into its own unique franchise worthy of standing side by side with the most popular monster collector series nowhere is this more true than with video games digimon titles have broken so far from what their contemporaries typically stick to but are also never set to adhering to a single genre or formula most games are unique and exciting adventures that just so happen to be set in the world of digimonone game that this growing fanbase has been eagerly looking forward to for years is the upcoming digimon survive this game will once again give the genre a shift by mixing new gameplay and narrative designs first announced in the japanese outlet v jump in digimon survive has suffered quite a troubled development however it seems that we can finally expect it to hit store shelves sooner rather than later if youre ready to do battle with your favorite digital monsters heres everything we know so far about digimon survivedigimon survive was first intended to come out in just a year after it was announced but that obviously didnt go to plan due to the worldwide pandemic and how it caused a massive impact on game development let alone all aspects of work and life producer kazumasa habu announced the delay by stating regarding survive the planned release date has been changed to because of a reorganization of our game development structure once again i feel deeply the hardships of game development we will continue to develop the game in order to make it a good product so please look forward to itagain we obviously know the plan didnt work out either and this timedigimon survive was delayed all the way into the latest news is promising which is that the game has a release date but only for japan this trend has been less and less common but regional releases do still happen digimon survive will come out on july in japan and while we wait for word on a worldwide release were confident that it wont be too much longer that the rest of us will have to waitdigimon survive is coming to just about every platform you could want it will launch on playstation xbox one xbox series x and s pc and even the nintendo switch on releasethe small teaser trailer showcases a lot of what digimon survive will be it opens on simple text cut between shots of various outdoor locations and a classical piano melody stating they have yet to know the world upon them they got lost when venturing into the wild and they ended up in a strangely nostalgic place there they met mysterious monsters little do they know in this word death and danger await at this point some japanese vocals kick in as we cut very quickly across many human and digimon characters talking more text comes on the screen saying to stay alive decisions have to be made this is a story of them trying to get out of a bizarre dimension this is a story of survivalwhile not a trailer exactly we do get a bulk of the story details from the opening movie that was released as well digimon survive will be focused on a new group of junior high students away at a summer camp takuma aoi and minaru are the main trio who want to discover the legend of kemonogami at the nearby local shrine this place is shrouded in mystery and offlimits but of course they go anyway which is where koromon is met at this point the group is attacked by more digimon and takuma attempts to protect his friends this prompts koromon to digivolve into agumon and intimidate the other digimon into fleeing however it becomes clear that the group is no longer in the world they previously knewother characters include ryou a somewhat cowardly character saki the outspoken and brash one shuuji a bookworm kaito the local who attempted to stop the others from going to the shrine and his sister miu the one who told the others about the forbidden shrine in the first placeeach main character will also pair up with a digimon although there are plenty more digimon shown off in the gamebeyond the setup it seems like the goal will be for this team of teenagers to work together amongst themselves and their new digimon companions to try and survive long enough to find a way back to their own worldin terms of gameplay digimon survive is taking an interesting turn on the usual formula by essentially splitting the game into two halves the first half includes the story sequences which look to be visual novelstyle sequences this part has also been shown to take two main forms free action and search action free action is when you will be able to explore the area speak to the other characters increase bonds and generally gather information about whats going on in that moment of the story before progressing search action is when you need to make decisions to try and survive different dire situationsdepending on your choices there will be a karma system that is influenced that will eventually dictate future story events but also how your partner digimon evolves the story can apparently branch to the point where certain characters diethe other main half is the battle portion which has been called free battle here digimon survive plays like a tacticsstyle rpg the game is played from an isometric perspective and uses a gridstyle map just like most classic tactics games you will be able to bring a roster of up to digimon into a single battle during which you will have the chance to recruit or defeat enemy digimon just like in a pokemon game beyond that the actual mechanics of battle are still mostly a mystery this is mainly because the only footage floating around is all in japanese making it hard to really know whats going onwhat we can say is that digimon survive at least looks it will play as you would expect a tactics rpg to each monster has a turn shown in a timeline in the upperright with move attack evolve partner and talk options partner is a little unclear but talk appears to be how you recruit other digimon and the others are selfexplanatory when attack is selected you can choose from a list of attacks see what squares on the grid they would affect and confirm the attack every digimon has hp and ep which we assume stands for evolution points as we see it is used for evolvingit is said thatdigimon survive will have approximately different digimon in the full roster to collect though habu has stated that it wont be possible to get every item evolution or digimon in one playthrough leading many to assume there will be a new gameplus mode to dive into after the story concludesaccording to the developers the game will lean more heavily on the narrative visual novelstyle elements of the game compared to battles at a ratio of about visual novel to battles they clock an average playtime to take around hours but more than twice that amount if you want to complete the game and see every possible route the story could godigimon survive is a solo experience as far as we can tell theres been no word either way on if theres multiplayer but considering the fact that the game is almost out in japan and theres been no mention of it and looking at how the game is so narrative focused there doesnt seem like any place for a multiplayer mode to fit its safe to assume this is a pure singleplayer adventurebased on how tight of an experience digimon survive is claiming to be we dont predict any dlc incoming for this title this is just our own speculation but from everything theyve said about the game it feels like they put creating a branching but complete story first and foremost when making this game digimon games dont tend to get dlc anyway and this game doesnt seem like a good fit for them to start withthe sad news is that unless you live in japan digimon survive still doesnt have a real release date yet so by extension preorders are not live as of yet since we expect the get that worldwide release date very soon after if not before the japanese release on july we will be sure to keep you up to date once you can reserve your copy,en,576,Positive
digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/bayonetta-3-release-date-trailer-gameplay-story-news/,Everything we know about Bayonetta 3,one of the most illustrious and anticipated upcoming switch games is bayonetta a title that has been cooking for quite some time now as its name suggests its the followup to bayonetta and will send players on another actionpacked journey as the sassy umbra witch known as bayonetta its in development by renowned studio platinumgames best known for fastpaced action games like metal gear rising revengeance astral chain the wonderful and nier automata to name a fewsince its announcement few details about bayonetta have been revealed however the september nintendo direct finally gave us a first look at the forthcoming action game with a release window and even gameplay footage we still have a flurry of questions but weve scoured the depths of the internet to find as much info about it as possiblefrom its potential release date to its trailer gameplay and more heres everything we know about bayonetta readinglets kick things off with the reveal trailer for bayonetta shown above the one that officially revealed the project during the game awards in it we get to see a closeup shot of the moon with the platinumgames logo followed by a quick action sequence featuring the witch herself based on the trailer it appears like bayonetta has her long hair back which was a point of contention since she had short hair in bayonetta a few quick shots its revealed that bayonetta is in development exclusively for nintendo switch eagleeyed fans have mentioned that the reveal trailer for bayonetta resembles almost shot by shot the teaser trailers for the previous two installments and as part of an interview with famitsu as relayed by dualshockers platinumgames said the initial bayonetta trailer has hidden secrets in itthat brings us to the second trailer which was shown during the september nintendo direct this was an absolute blowout of a trailer giving us nearly four minutes of bayonetta goodness it showed off gameplay some of the characters bayonetta herself sporting a new haircut and the gameplay it ended with a release window which was certainly heartening to see we wont spoil the trailer here so give it a watch aboveafter a lengthy development cycle bayonetta will finally be ready to launch in platinumgames and nintendo didnt announce a specific date but it might make sense for it to come out in the summer its launch day depends on how the development cycle shakes out along with other nintendo switch release dates the game was initially revealed in so its been a long time coming thats for sure hopefully it reaches its release windowsince the september nintendo direct nothing else has been shown but considering the games director yusuke miyatasaid the team was in the home stretch of development at the end of last year bayonetta should be ready to launch soon bayonetta was released in september so perhaps bayonetta will do the same in nintendos slate for late summer fall and winter is still unknown so assuming bayonetta is still on track to launch in its highly likely it will release at the end of the yearas noted in its announcement trailer bayonetta is in development exclusively for nintendo switch much like bayonetta before it the newest entry will be published by nintendo meaning it wont come to other platforms at least not anytime soon its possible bayonetta will eventually launch on nintendos next console much like the way bayonetta jumped from wii u to the switch but at this point nothing like that has been confirmed platinumgames does have a history of working with multiple platforms so its likely not out of the question well eventually see bayonetta on nonnintendo consoles at some point in the future for now count on playing it on switchbayonetta will play like its predecessors giving us a fastpaced action adventure with tons of style and flair given the games lengthy development cycle new features will likely be implemented based on the recent trailer it looks like the new installment will implement largescale battles between massive creatures bayonetta can control a kaijulike monster to defend against another foe of equal size which will probably make for some fastpaced memorable moments bayonetta has always been wild and overthetop but this entry seems like it will raise the bar particularly in terms of scale which were excited aboutwe can expect to see large areas to explore fluid action gameplay and a wacky story that aims to captivate its fan base bayonetta will probably have a continuation of the combo system along with various powerups weapons items and moreas part of a eurogamer interview with platinumgames cofounder atsushi inaba it was revealed bayonetta would still be a linear core progression action game but notes that new features and mechanics would be added as well platinum knows that fans expect crazier better tighter action games so well likely see a noticeable evolution with bayonetta an interview with vgc platinumgames studio head atsushi inaba said for bayonetta we can say that we learned enough from making the past two games to change our process in a way thats different to what i just described maybe the players will recognize this as well and thats all the hints you getagain its unclear how this new development process will translate to the gameplay itself but youll likely see some changes with the third entry when everything is all said and donebayonetta featured an interesting coop multiplayer component called tag climax that allowed players to team up to defeat waves of enemies with the original wii u release that mode was carried over to the switch edition and was one of the most beloved aspects of the entire package with this in mind there is precedent for the inclusion of a multiplayer mode that could return in bayonetta though nothing has been confirmedits possible multiplayer might be totally scrapped to focus on the singleplayer portion of the forthcoming release weve seen this happen with sequels before like in bioshock infinite or the last of us part ii since nothing about multiplayer has been confirmed one way or the other we cant say for sure but we do hope multiplayer makes its return since tag climax was so fun in bayonetta bayonetta free dlc costumes were implemented including ones based on link from the legend of zelda princess peach from super mario princess daisy from super mario fox mccloud from star fox and samus aran from metroid since bayonetta will be published by nintendo it may include a similar set of costumes for the heroine to utilizeas for more substantial dlc like new story content or levels its unlikely as platinumgames doesnt have much of a history adding major expansions after launch there are a few exceptions like with nier automata and metal gear rising but for the most part you shouldnt expect major dlc in bayonetta course nothing about dlc has been confirmed so we cant say for certain just yetfinally you might be wondering about preordering bayonetta at this point preorders arent available just yet due to platinum and nintendo remaining tightlipped about the projects development schedule typically games become available to preorder when a solid release date is announced in referencing the rerelease of bayonetta for switch consumers were able to preorder shortly after the ports announcement in december at the game awards before its release in february then developers and publishers have eased back on announcing release dates too early as fans are often disappointed when delays occur with that in mind dont expect to be able to preorder bayonetta until closer to launchas for preorder bonuses you may get some extra goodies when you buy early though as history shows we wouldnt count on too much with bayonetta japanese customers gained access to a microfiber cloth when preordering through amazon but aside from that there wasnt much in terms of extra bonuses since the series has a much bigger fan base now the preorder bonuses might be more plentiful with the next release but nothing has yet been confirmed,en,530,Positive

original game and offering it bundled with the sequel to get any fans who missed out on the original a chance to catch up on the world those plans now make more sense because they were building up to the next entry into the franchisexenoblade chronicles was announced in the nintendo direct in february sending fans into a whirlwind of excitement the announcement came out of nowhere catching everyone off guard but in the best way possible the new title isnt tied directly to the previous two entries instead they are set in parallel worlds or times the setup is a little complex but worth the investment for how well crafted these games are narratively and mechanically if this is your first dive into the world of aionios or third heres everything we know about xenoblade chronicles chronicles was a surprise reveal in terms of the game even existing but perhaps even more exciting was how soon we will be able to play it nintendo did say that the game was due to release sometime in september but in a unique twist for the gaming industry nintendo tweeted out that xenoblade chronicles would be coming two months earlier now on july whatever the reason fans are certainly happy they can get their hands on the game sooner than expectedthe entire xenoblade franchise as well as developer monolith soft are owned by nintendo so just like all previous entries in the series xenoblade chronicles will only be coming to the nintendo switch console we wouldnt hold our breath for this game to be ported to any other system any time soonthe announcement trailer we got for xenoblade chronicles is somewhat brief but packed with things to dissect and speculate on we see a blackhaired girl playing a flute as a narration begins over a raging battle full of soldiers with neon weaponry and massive mechs towering above we then see the iconic sword from the series as two characters engage in a duel while arguing over allegiances the pace picks up flashing between more character reveals more flute players and more voiceovers these two apparently share a destiny and can seemingly share memories as stated in the release trailerthere are a few shots of different characters running around massive environments a staple of the series since the beginning as well as massive cities and intimidatingly large machines a few more characters who appear to be the antagonists show up but again in too short a time to really see before the trailer comes to a calm close on two characters playing their flutes on a grassy cliff this trailer is certainly meant to convey the emotional tone the game will have rather than explicitly explain any part of the storythis trailer alone would be hard to gather much concrete info from but thankfully more information exists to pull together first a tweet from nintendo itself gives us the basic premise of the game in aionios the world of there are two opposing nations keves and agnus theyre in steady conflict with each other and their soldiers fight with their lives on the line every day just to survivekeves is a civilization formed around technology it was the first to create mechs and utilize them advanced weaponry and vehicles in combat agnus is the mirror image and instead centers around magical technologies gathered from ether people of agnus wear white as opposed to keves uniforms of blackthis has led fans to believe that xenoblade chronicles may take place after the events of the second game the simple concept of life has been cited as the games primary theme it centers on these two warring nations as well as two protagonists named noah and mio the two we saw at one point fighting in the trailer perhaps they come from each side of the conflict but join forces to help resolve the conflictthe rest of the confirmed main characters named ones anyway are lanz eunie taion and sena however because of some comments made last year by voice actor jenna coleman melia in the original xenoblade chronicles some people think her character might be set to appear in xenoblade chronicles as well because of the long lifespans of characters in this world and the timeline already being a little weird it wouldnt be impossible for melia or even others like zeke poppi nia dromarch pyra and other franchise characters to show up as well again this is all speculative at this pointthis is where we see the least in the trailer but looks to at least be following the same idea as the two prior games from what we did see there will be massive openworld areas to explore both natural and more citylike we also see that multiple main characters are playable though it isnt clear yet if we will be able to switch on the fly or if we will be swapping between them based on the story the latest trailer also revealed that up to seven characters can be in our party at once timewe see plenty of vehicle traversal as well including a boat crossing water though you can also swim in some areas at least and grinding on a rail to cross massive chasmsaside from giant mechs there are still huge natural enemies to encounter the trailer shows multiple dragonlike enemies stomping around or even swimming which should provide a decent challengewe do see some first looks at gameplay in the latest trailer which mostly confirms that xenoblade chronicles will play similar to the prior games in those titles combat ran in real time with normal attacks automatically triggering when characters were in range of an enemy this let you worry about managing your abilities called battle arts exploiting weaknesses and managing your party things obviously go deeper than that but we suspect xenoblade chronicles to spice up the formula in at least a few ways outside of these core mechanicsin the footage shown thus far we see the ui has the tactics button chain attack fusion and different skills mapped to four face buttons that fusion appears to combine two noah and mio into a single very powerful unit in battle we see multiple types of these purple hybrid characters showing that multiple characters will be able to fuse into different types of combinations such as eunie and taion being a more feminine form that attacks with wing looking weapons and lanz and sena combining into a unit with massive gauntlets to deal high melee damagechain attacks bring all the party members together to attack a target together the gauge will also show how much extra damage this attack will do which can be boosted further with completion bonusesxenoblade chronicles will be a singleplayer experience just like the previous entries unless nintendo announces some kind of surprise extra mode or maybe a minigame theres almost no chance this game will include a multiplayer component of any kind this is a storyheavy focused jrpg meant to be enjoyed by yourself and the excellent characters in the gamethis is another area like multiplayer where we are forced to guess at any plans normally for a singleplayer jrpg like this we would lean against there being dlc however xenoblade chronicles did get four dlc items via an expansion pass this included some items new quests a weapon a new battle mode and even a new storyline called torna the golden country based on that which is really all we have then theres a good chance that there will be some form of dlc for xenoblade chronicles as well whether it will be simply items or an expansive new storyline and mode we will simply have to wait for the official word to knowxenoblade chronicles is up for preorders just about everywhere for the standard theres only the regular edition listed right now but nintendo has teased a deluxe edition that they will share details on how to get soon once that information is released we will let you know exactly whats included how much it is and where you can reserve a copy,en,602,Positive

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/how-to-unlock-characters-in-genshin-impact/,How to unlock characters in Genshin Impact,genshin impact is a freetoplay openworld action rpg that feels like the legend of zelda breath of the wild but if botw had elements of a mobile game developer mihoyo was better known for its mobile rpgs until genshin impact exploded onto the console mobile and pc scene while the base game is free to play genshin impact at the end of the day is still a gacha gamefatestory progressiongacha games are built to have players spend ingame currency for the chance to unlock random items they are similar to how microtransactions work in other freetoplay games like apex legends fortnite and call of duty warzone these ingame purchases are one way to unlock new characters in genshin impact however theyre not the only way heres everything you need to know about how to unlock characters in genshin impactthe good news is that new players wont have to spend any money to gather a capable party at the start of the game simply by progressing through the main quest players will add enough characters to field a full fourperson team along with the games main character when youre first starting out in genshin impact its a good idea to follow the introductory archon quest to round out your party before getting too deep into its openworld explorationon top of the basic characters unlocked through genshin impacts story there are two more free teammates who you can recruit by completing certain challenges the first of these is barbara a healer with waterbased spells who makes a welcome addition to any party to unlock barbara players will need to reach adventure rank and complete the quest called a long shot players earn progress toward their adventure rank for nearly everything they do in genshin impact from completing quests to opening treasure chests and the rewards come quickly near the beginning of the gametheres another character available without using genshin impacts gacha system xiangling is a firebased polearm user who can be unlocked by progressing through the games spiral abyss the spiral abyss is an unlockable dungeon that offers players increasingly challenging floors of combat encounters to fight through you can unlock xiangling by beating floor chamber of the spiral abyss each floor in the dungeon has three chambers so youll only need to fight through nine separate encounters to unlock her however the challenge escalates quickly so to easily unlock xiangling youll need a party of characters at around level will need to spend an ingame currency called fate to unlock any additional characters you can spend a fate at any time in the games wish menu to get a randomly drawn character or item there are two different kinds of fate acquaint fate and intertwined fate that can be used to try to win from different pools of characters and weaponsacquaint fate is the more common currency letting players wish on a standard wish banner with set odds of earning one of many characters or weapons in the game new players can also use acquaint fate on a special beginners wish banner which lets them pull two sets of random weapons or characters at a discount meaning youll spend just acquaint fates for a total of weapons or characters if a player uses wishes on the beginners wish banner theyll also be guaranteed to receive noelle a highdefense character whos also a capable healerintertwined fates can be used on character event wish banners which offer increased chances of winning certain highlevel characters with a selection that changes over time keep in mind that either type of wish can reward either weapons or characters so it can take several tries to get any new characters at allthe only way to unlock new characters through genshin impacts gacha system is by spending fate but fortunately there are a lot of ways to acquire it the game is fairly generous with handing out fates to new players to get them started so anyone joining early should have a decent stock to use on new characters right away fates are also rarely offered as quest rewards or adventure rank rewards providing another boost in the early gamethe main method of acquiring more fates however is by spending primogems which are handed out as rewards much more often than fates you can get them as rewards for completing lots of ingame activities from quests to dungeons to daily challenges mihoyo also offers free primogems as daily login bonuses and even gives them away to make up for lost time during routine server maintenance you should be able to earn enough primogems to buy dozens of fates just by playing through whats currently available in the gamehowever genshin impact being a freetoplay game primogems are also available for purchase with real money players can purchase primogems as part of the games battle pass which offers various rewards including gear and levelup items or through a separate monthly purchase which offers far more primogems per dollartheres one final way of unlocking characters which requires you to first have fate to spend each time you use a wish in genshin impact youll receive a small quantity of either masterless stardust or masterless starglitter depending on the rarity of the item or character you receive for every few wishes you make youll receive enough stardust or starglitter to purchase more fate in the ingame store keeping the character unlocking cycle going a little longerin short theres a lot to keep track of when it comes to unlocking characters in genshin impact while it may seem overwhelming at first the system makes much more sense once youve actually used it once or twice just remember if you want to unlock the most characters possible keep looking for ways to acquire more fate and primogems and dont be afraid to use them its also entirely possible to play through the entire game without spending a cent if youre willing to wait for those characters to unlock,en,402,Positive

had one of the neater regions the hoenn island region felt larger than previous regions and was generally a more interesting area to explore a pair of stellar gen three remakes omega ruby and alpha sapphire are available on nintendo pokmon rowlet cyndaquil oshawottthere is some question as to whether pokemon legends arceus is technically a mainline title regardless of how you feel there is no doubt that this is an ambitious and fresh take for the series we praised pokmon legends arceus in our review for the way it makes bold changes to the triedandtrue formula successfully kicking off pokmons longneeded reinvention capturing and battling pokmon meets a breath of the wild like open world in a game that may shape the future of the series for years to come its helped back a bit by the nintendo switchs technical limitations but the pokdex system and outstanding battling make this a cant miss pokmon entrystarter pokmon grookey scorbunny sobblethe latest pokmon games are the first mainline titles released as a nintendo switch game and game freak has finally realized our longtime dream of having a fully pokmon adventure on a home console in the britishthemed galar region you can venture into the new wild area and capture monsters or follow the set pathways from town to town that have been in the series since the very beginning either way pokmon are now just out and about instead of being hidden in randomized encounters so frustration is greatly reducedwith pokmon to catch and the addition of the dynamax system to power up your monsters pokmon sword and shield can keep you busy for hours however the removal of longtime monsters from the game including psyduck and squirtle does mean you cant catch em all this time fortunately with the arrival of the games isle of armordlc and crown tundra dlc youll have a chance to see new environments in the galar region catch new pokmon and battle new foesstarter pokmon rowlet litten poppliosun and moon and the enhanced

able to battle the islands kahunathe new pokmon were some of the most interesting to be added since the early games and the alolan versions of original pokmon felt inspired zmoves ultra beasts and an expanded take on mega evolutions added welcome mechanics into the fold there was even a pokmon snapstyle minigame making this one of the best games you can buystarter pokmon chespin fennekin froakiepokmon x and y marked the series first truly experience the camera perspective switched from topdown to a closer behindthebody angle which gave the world of pokmon a sense of scope it hadnt seen before the franceinspired kalos region had flair and style and featured one of the largest megacities wed seen thus farthough x and y only introduced new pokmon it did mark the beginning of mega

animationsstarter pokmon turtwig chimchar pipluppokmon diamond pearl and platinum served an important role in the evolution of pokmon they looked markedly better than gen three pokmon thanks to the nintendo ds but they mainly showed where the franchise would eventually go generation four brought a very important feature online trading and battling this made filling out the pokdex which then neared with the help of the new pocket monsters more of a global effortyou didnt have to know people with copies of the game to trade instead you could just hop online and make a trade for what you needed online battling lets you really see who was the best trainer for the first time in series history generation four is great because of its technological innovations but its one of the more forgettable pokmon time periods overallstarter pokmon snivy tepig oshawottgeneration five was an oddity it was the first in the series to get a direct sequel with black and white releasing a year after the originals the sequels did retread familiar territory but told a new story and featured some new areas and new pokmon generation five also holds the record for the most pokmon with new pokmon to catcheven more so than diamond and pearl though gen five especially the sequels felt like a stopgap for the series next evolution while we regard generation five as the worst we still think its pretty darn good it didnt introduce much new at all but the true sequel concept was intriguing nonethelesswhen you have a winning formula its hard to want to change it the pokmon games have found their niche audience and have managed to keep this audience entertained regardless of graphics however the pokmon franchise has managed to push out a few remakes that are worth your time although these games are almost identical to the games listed above they do have some improvements to each game that make them worth checking out and were usually compatible with the latest installment in the main series allowing for some interesting crossgeneration trading and battlingstarter chikorita cyndaquil totodileif you havent guessed yet pokmon heartgold and soulsilver are enhanced versions of

welcomed to the sevii islands which is a completely new area that wasnt available in either red or blue this island stands out because it holds pokmon that were normally exclusive to the johto region and has a few postgame missions that can be fun whats more once the missions on the sevii islands are completed players were able to trade pokmon with players who had ruby or sapphire making it possible to have hoennexclusive pokmon as wellstarters treecko torchic mudkipthose of us who preferred pokmon ruby and sapphire were invited back to the game with omega ruby and alpha sapphire the game is part of the sixth generation of pokmon games and was played on the nintendo although the game is a remake game freak worked to ensure that it had some of the changes from later generationswe saw pokmon with split types from the fourth generation and had unlimited tm usage and triple battles from the fifth generation they also added features frompokmonx and y such as super training and mega evolution one of the new mechanics that stood out was the ability to use latios or latias to fly around hoenn this is because when using these pokmon to fly we could run into mirage spots which had pokmon that werent otherwise available in the hoenn region this includes numerous legendary pokmon from previous generationsstarters turtwig chimchar piplupthe release of pokmon brilliant diamond and pokmon shining pearl finally brought gamers a pair of longrequested remakes the two classic nintendo titles come to the nintendo switch with updated gameplay enhanced visuals an expanded endgamewe praised the game in our review for faithfully translating pokmon diamond and pokmon pearl in a way that felt authentic to the originals that can be a bit of a doubleedged sword as the linear path and lack of challenging gameplay will be appealing for young gamers but may turn off series veterans the underground has been expanded into the new grand underground this end game area now contains a sprawling dungeon where you can battle and capture pokmon of various types its great for gathering xp or filling out your pokdexstarters rowlet litten popplioas part of the seventh generation of pokemon games pokemon ultra sun and ultra moon enhance the versions of the original sun and moon in a way that makes them enjoyable critics and players were a bit divided on how this game felt on one

added to the game things like ultra beasts new forms of legendary pokmon necrozma and a new lycanroc form we could also travel around the alola region to collect totem stickers which would then give us a chance to get a totemsized variant of a pokmon we also had a few new activities mantine surf let us surf across the regions seas the alola photo club got us to take pictures with our pokmon and

tactics experience set in the new ransei region it told a wholly original story filled with warlords and waging factions while the turnbased tactics gameplay wasnt as deep or challenging as games such

wild pokmon lets go also depicts wild pokmon roaming the overworld so you always know what youre getting into beforehand pokmon lets go is a wonderful melding of two types of pokmon gamespokmonpuzzle league is essentially justtetris attack with a different coat of paint but it is still one of the more entertaining pokmon games outside of the main series the game is simple the players board is on one side of the screen with the opponents on the otherboth boards will fill up with the tiles and players must rearrange the tiles to create lines of three or more in a row doing so will clear the tiles from your board and send blocks to your opponents which theyll have to clear out the game is straightforward but challenging and is particularly fun to play against another person the presence of various characters from pokmon also gives it a warm feeling of nostalgiapokmonpinballfor the game boy color is surprisingly addictive for a game with only two tables hitting certain objects on the table will cause pokmon to appear and players can then catch them by hitting them with the ball multiple times before the time limit runs outthough it is a basic game there are some interesting aspects to it it has a misshapen game cartridge that contains a batterypowered rumble feature to add some haptic feedback this was a unique novelty for the game boy when this game was releasedpokmon

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/splatoon-3-release-date-trailer-gameplay-news/,Everything we know about Splatoon 3,whether youre a squid or a kid or both get ready for the next splattastic entry in the hit splatoon series originating on the wiiu splatoon was a hit for the struggling console it was a rare game for nintendo being a mostly onlinefocused thirdperson shooter but was given a unique coat of ink rather than your normal soldiers fighting it out with guns nintendo flipped the concept into something far more colorful and friendly by pitting two teams of squid kids against each other with inkbased weapons a sequel came early in the switchs life cycle and was an allaround improvement on the first adding more weapons maps and even a singleplayer modeearly in nintendo revealed that we would be getting a new splatoon game on the switch at the time it was simply known as splatoon and we got a small reveal trailer that both answered and raised a host of questions about this sequel after the reveal we have gotten a few bits and pieces of information about splatoon if youre ready to dive into all the details about this new colorful shooter weve got all the info you needsplatoon has been known about for a while but the latest update we got on the games release only narrowed down the window to summer however and take this with a grain of salt some eagleeyed viewers noticed a qr code hidden in the trailer that when scanned displays the date of august as it turns out that date was still a bit off in an official tweet from nintendo of europe they dropped the full release date as being september is the easiest question to answer about this gamesplatoon will be a nintendo switch exclusive nintendo has never shared its firstparty games with other platforms or even pc so this one will be no differentour first real look at splatoon came in the nintendo direct from september this trailer called return of the mammalians focused heavily on the games story mode the reveal trailer already set the stage for the world of splatoon being in some sort of postapocalypse earth where inklings have evolved to be the dominant life form however as the trailer goes on some new furry creatures begin to appear as the footage cuts and glitches outnintendo itself has put out a small description for splatoon the official page saying the theme of splatoon story mode appears to be return of the mammalians wha as far as we know mammals have disappeared from the surface of the planet minus a couple of cool cats of course what does it mean for these inklings this heavily implies these mammalians will be the new or additional threat alongside the established octariansthe trailer otherwise showed off a few new environments including some psychedelic cities snowy beaches and japaneseinspired areas there are also plenty of familiar characters making a return with the squid sisters callie and marie and capn cuttlefish how this story will play out or even any of the major details is being kept a secret for nowas much intrigue as there is in the story its the gameplay most people come to splatoon for and will be the thing that people stick to splatoon for in both trailers we can see that the core of the splatoon formula will remain the same you will take control of your inkling from a thirdperson perspective to coat stages in ink with your weapon of choice we got a good look at the most popular mode turf war as it did in the previous games this mode pits two teams of four against one another to try to cover as much of the map as possible with their teams ink colorincluded in the newest trailer were some crazy new weapons and what looks to be some sort of robot crab called a crab tank you can pilot that rolls around like a ball and opens up to blast ink out of a cannon this doesnt last for very long though and youre not invincible while in it other new weapons and devices included the big bubbler which creates a shield over an area the zipcaster an inky grappling hook you can zip around the map with the killer wail which will automatically shoot lasers from a series of megaphones an umbrella shield and a bow and arrowas part of this mammal theme a new mechanic to splatoon will be something called fuzzy ink this is described as something that pulsates like a lifeform but doesnt actually seem to be a living creature in practice it will coat any inkling that touches it in fur coating them to the point where theyre temporarily unable to control their character were unsure if this is just a singleplayer mechanic or something you will be able to use in online multiplayer as wellnew maps have also been confirmed we saw an urbanneighborhoodlooking stage called eeltail alley the museum dalfonsino and a desert level called scorch gorge certainly more maps old and new will also be available upon releasethe only gameplay trailer we have was of the turf war game mode at the opening we see each player who can have a little player card with a title of sorts like clockedout turf warrior and inkless office drone that we can probably unlock in different ways otherwise the majority of the gameplay looked very familiar each team ran around trying to paint as much of the map as possible as well as splat opponents if you do get eliminated you get a nice look at all the gear the person who took you out was wearingwe get a little look at a vacuumstyle gun that charges up for a big blast and the bow and arrow weapon along with plenty of returning favorites when the match ends you get a lineup of the winning team but also a list of what medals you earned during the matchthe entire splatoon series is primarily focused on multiplayer which is an odd sentence to say for most nintendo games still even with the inclusion of a story mode in the sequel and how splatoon looks to expand on the story and lore of the world further multiplayer is the beating heart of the game aside from turf war though we dont know exactly what other new or old modes will be included in the game we expect the most popular ranked modes like splat zones tower control and clam blitz to come back or we just really hope they do but will have to wait for confirmationthe latest trailer confirmed the return of the popular salmon run mode now renamed as salmon run next wave this is once again a pve cooperative mode where you team up against swarms of enemies new and old plus boss encounters like the fish stick this massive pillar with flying enemies tied to the top slams down on the map and sprays ink in a wide range the major baddie shown off was the massive salmonoid eggs are now throwable allowing for far more coordination and teamworkwe dont know what dlc plans are for now but splatoon has a good history of adding more content after launch there are plenty of ways for nintendo to add more content as they did with the previous games whether it be in new maps weapons story missions or just cosmetics dlc for splatoon was almost universally enjoyed so wed be glad to see what plans there are for continued support for splatoon hopefully soonnormally there would be nothing to say about preorders until a release date was set and yet one retailer is already taking orders for splatoon for now the only place taking preorders is best buy though if that isnt an option for you then the rest of the usual outlets will also open up their preorders once the release date is set once nintendo gives us the details on that plus any unique versions it is offering well update you with all that good info,en,536,Positive

teamups and coop games with friends the missions themselves make great use of the several different classes in the game each with specific skills for both mining and fighting every mission allows players to explore an environment locate and mine precious ores then escape a horde of ravenous insect aliens points are earned and upgrades are bought to improve your class of choice without anything feeling too tedious or timeintensivebut deep rock galactic is special in other ways as well what other game has space dwarves explore intergalactic mining deposits with pickaxes and lasers and beer

happening exactly with the latest updating being a loose holiday call it abreath of the wild clone just yet but sonic is going open world in his next adventure this seems like a natural fit for the

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-bethesda-games/,The best Bethesda games of all time,bethesda is one of the rare cases of a game developer finding so much success that they branched out to become one of the biggest publishers in the western gaming market while not quite as gigantic as the likes of an activision or ea bethesda has a great stable of developers themselves included that have made some of the most ambitious games on the market whether its the cuttingedge technology coming out of id software the highoctane fps action of machine games or even the more experimental titles from arkane bethesdas name is attached to far more than just their highprofile rpg seriessince they were acquired by microsoft all of bethesdas games including the games made by the studios under them will be console exclusive to that platform moving forward however there is a long history of games already released for multiple platforms and between all the studios bethesda is in charge of there are games of all types to check out you will obviously know the major players here such as the elder scrolls and fallout but there are way more bethesda games that are just as good thats why weve rounded up this list of the best bethesda games of all timewhat is there that can be said aboutskyrimthat hasnt been said already this massive game is not only the pinnacle of the elder scrolls series at least until the untitled elder scrolls vi releases but it also shattered all expectations it wasnt just a critical hit but a sales juggernaut as well the game originally came out in for the xbox playstation and pc but it has been ported almost as much as the originaldoomand has sold well every time it was released after that it makes sense why the world bethesda created or rather this region of it is just brimming with unique and dynamic events to experience the number of things to do and see and ways to play make it feel like a true rpg experience in ways most other games could only hope to beyesskyrimis not immune to the usual bugs and glitches that bethesda games are known for in this case though none of them are really gamebreaking unless youre playing on the and the game was so ambitious for the time that many people were willing to overlook a few rough edges the plot isnt much to write home about and many people never even saw it through but thats just a minor fraction of the content on offer inskyrim side quests are everywhere caves and dungeons to explore are around every corner and interesting characters populate all the citiesskyrimis a game where you can easily spend or more hours never touching the main quest and still have plenty to doread our full the elder scrolls v skyrimreviewfallout new vegaswhile it was bethesda themselves that took the old fallout series and brought it back to life as a more modern rpg it was actually obsidian entertainment also purchased by microsoft by the way that really blended the oldschool rpg mechanics and tone of the original game with the gameplay mechanics bethesda revived the series withfallout a great game dont get us wrong but the fans of the older titles certainly had some problems with it while it was an openworld game it was far less open in terms of player choice and influence and not quite as strong in the writing department many just assumed that was the price we had to pay for bringing the game into a fully open world with voiced npcs that was untilfallout new vegasarrivedan unfortunate trend with obsidian is that theyre constantly given criminally short development times to produce what are expected to be blockbuster hits andfallout new vegasis a great example of that eighteen months is almost no time at all to create a game let alone a massive openworld rpg that players expect to have deep systems dozens of quests that can be completed in multiple ways tons of weapons and strong writing the fact thatfallout new vegasmanages to accomplish basically all of those things without falling apart at the seams is nothing short of miraculous that said it does have more than its fair share of bugs and glitches even for a game made on bethesdas

action incredibly satisfying gorefest play on anything higher than the lower difficulties and youll find that this game has way more depth in its combat than basically any shooter released in the past decade id made combat a multilayered puzzle of sorts with a genius design that forces you to stay mobile aggressive and strategic all at once each enemy has a weakness you can exploit but ammo for each gun is limited forcing you to use your entire arsenal as well as your chainsaw to refill enemies hit hard and fast so youll need to make sure to weaken enemies for glory kills to restore your hp but also utilize your flamethrower to make them drop armor to preserve that healthall those pieces make each combat encounter both mentally and physically challenging or at least in terms of execution exhausting in the best way successfully taking out the most dangerous threats doublejumping and dashing to avoid damage keeping your health up and perfectly dispatching smaller foes with brutal glory kills for just a brief second of reprieve all while the drums and guitars ramp up with the action leads to feeling like an absolute beast when the final demon is splattered against the wall the game

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/overwatch-2-release-date-trailer-heroes-gameplay-news/,Everything we know about Overwatch 2,overwatch rumored release date has come and gone and players still dont have the sequel in their hands announced at blizzcon blizzard has slowly released details aboutoverwatch including showing off concept art for new maps and letting streamers sit down to play the gamealthough we still dont have a release date or any concrete details on preorders blizzard has revealed a lot aboutoverwatch with even more details coming from the recent blizzconline this february until the next event gives us new details to work with heres everything we know about overwatch announcedoverwatch the opening ceremony of blizzcon although the development team showed off some new content game director jeff kaplan said that he has no idea when it will release at the time kaplan said that blizzard doesnt have a date in a mind and thats still true todayblizzard still refused to give us a firm release date foroverwatch blizzcon event the only news we got regarding the games launch was confirmation that it wontbe coming this year in november however some disappointing news hit that bothoverwatch and diablo had been delayed getting delayed before even having a release window leads us and many others to believe that overwatch may not come around until available on pc playstation xbox one and nintendo switch blizzard confirmed in that overwatch coming to every platform that currently supports the first gamegiven thatoverwatch was released simultaneously on xbox one and pc in overwatch likely launch on pc and consoles on the same day we dont know for certain that the game will come to the playstation and xbox series x but it would be very strange if it wasnt based on how long we still have to wait for italthough we havent had a chance to get our hands onoverwatch some players have youtuber ohnickel was allowed to stream nearly two hours of gameplay from the blizzcon show floor and unsurprisingly the game looks greatduring the blizzcon event we got a look at a new talent system that shows each character having their own abilities and skill trees to unlock odds are this will be specific to the pve modes of the game but it may show up in traditional multiplayer as well we also saw that some characters are getting a facelift reinhardt doesnt have a helmet anymore mercy got a haircut and lucio has glowing hair so far there are new character designs for tracer mercy lucio reinhardt genji mei and winston which you can find here it sounds like all of the heroes are getting a graphical update thoughto those versed inoverwatchlore sojourn is a natural inclusion foroverwatch been featured in multiple cinematics for the original game and has roots dating back to before overwatchs launch michael chu lead writer of overwatch told playstation blog that she will be extremely important to the events that take place in overwatch place of arms sojourn has two guns one is clearly shown as a fastfiring railgun in the gameplay trailer while the other shoots an areaofeffect orb that not only slows opponents caught inside but also chips away at their health she can also use jets on her legs to perform long slides and leaps sliding under barriers and briefly hovering in the air for her ultimate called overclock sojourn can charge up her railgun and shoot a highly damaging piercing shotgoing backward all overwatchheroes will be inoverwatch the announcement panel as well as in several interviews kaplan confirmed that theyre not cutting any characters from the roster simply adding new ones well likely see some balance changes to account for the new heroes but the roster is only going to grow from here on outoverwatch multiplayer pvp environment is simply an extension of the first game when playing competitively all players will operate in the same ecosystem regardless of the game version they have blizzard will add new pvp content to overwatchcreating a centralized system for all playerswe dont know how this will look however you may need an external account but that seems unlikely given blizzards dedication to maintaining the current overwatchecosystem we know that players with both versions of the game will play together however we dont know if players on other platforms will play togetherthis centralized approach also affects cosmetics all of your cosmetics from the first game will transfer to overwatch although blizzard isnt releasing any new heroes for the base game until the sequel launches the cosmetic factory is still in full swing even now you can rest assured that if you earn rewards from loot boxes youll have them in overwatch has been at the center of the controversy surrounding loot boxes though they may not be present in the second entry in an interview with pcgamesnoverwatch game director jeff kaplan had this to say well we have made a lot of changes to loot boxes and how they work over the years so were definitely open to change overwatch in terms of business model were exploring different options that move us away from loot boxes in the same interview kaplan mentioned a battle pass though not as a direct replacement for loot boxesoverwatch bring a few new multiplayer game modes but we only know about one push essentially two teams each have a robot pushing a barrier to the other side of the map if you push the enemy team far enough back the barrier will move forward and vice versa push is a bit of a riff on escort except both teams have payloads they need to protectfrankly it looks excellent the focus on two central points opens up a lot of possibilities sure youre going to encounter a firefight around each barrier however you can use that to your advantage to hang back and attack from a different anglein a very controversial move especially in the competitive scene blizzard has chosen to change one of the core dynamics of overwatchin the sequel by reducing team sizes from six players to just five the games director aaron keller claims this change was to help simplify the game that can have a lot going on and make it easier for players to know whats happening and what they should be doing during a livestream keller said overwatchhas changed over time weve gone from having no hero limits at all in the game to having a hero limit we ended up introducing a role lock over the course of the game and we feel like this is the next step in the way thatoverwatchought to be playedalong with the change from to teams will also be limited to only one tank character per team on this keller said tanks can be problematic a damagepersecond hero is simple theyre shooting but a tank has abilities that can be noisy or when stacked with other tanks can cause problems for other teams to try to overcome and counterbeyond those changes we can expect some familiar heroes to be altered as well so fartwo character overhauls have been outlined doomfist and orisa doomfist will now be a tank class has more health has less damage but higher ammo regen and has a new power block and seismic slam among other tweaks orisa has similar tweaks but the biggest are her new energy javelin that shoots a stunning javelin at an enemy the javelin spin that destroys incoming projectiles and pushes enemies back and terra surge which pulls enemies in gives you the forty effects and charges up a surge of damage she will no longer have protective barrier halt or superchargertaking cues from the battle royale genre overwatch is also confirmed to be adding a handy ping system this will allow players who dont have the option to or simply prefer not to engage in voice chat to still have a streamlined way to communicate with their teammates this system will be contextual meaning the options or directions you have will vary depending on what it is youre looking at such as an enemy or objective pinging an enemy will mark them though if they use an ability to teleport or go invisible the ping will turn into a question mark at their last known position it is hoped that this system can help curb some of the toxicity the original hadfinally besides just the addition of new maps to keep things fresh overwatch maps will also include a system called environment states this will give maps a new feel each time you play by implementing different weather effects and times of the day that means one match may see you playing a certain map during the night another during a snowstorm or a desert map during a sandstormthe only things that blizzard wont add tooverwatchare the pve modes there are two types of pve missions story and herostory mode is essentially a coopoverwatch players will join arms as various heroes from theoverwatchroster to take down the robotic null sector although we dont know much about story mode yet we do know that youll be able to pick up items while youre playing playing as tracer for example you could pick up a barrier shield to protect you when bullets start flying none of the items are exclusive to any particular hero but they wont carry over between missions each mission will also feature one of blizzards excellent cinematics to lead you in and out of the missionhero mode is a living pve environment the missions are designed for high replayability allowing players to group up and take on the same swarm of enemies over and over again these will be played across many maps with unpredictable objectives and enemies thrown in each time you play the main draw of this mode seems to be character progression as you play hero missions youll earn experience for the hero youre playing as which unlocks modifiers for that heros abilities given how strict blizzard is about competitive play we suspect that these buffs are exclusive to pveits probably safe to assumeoverwatch receive dlc over time just like the original game however it probably wont fit the mold of traditional dlc released for singleplayer games as a live game blizzard will likely continue monetizing overwatch cosmetics and ingame items not expansions or map packs insteadoverwatch get that content for free like the first gameoverwatch continues to receive updates from blizzard with new content even four years after release players can expect that blizzard will continue releasing that content foroverwatch foroverwatch gone live yet and with the recent news of a delay making most agree that the game isnt even releasing in odds are were quite a long way off from hearing anything

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-best-stealth-games-of-all-time/,The best stealth games,the stealth video game genre is one that has gained a lot of traction in recent years while itll likely never reach the heights of shooters sports games or action adventures the stealth genre is often home to some of the most inventive video game experiences out therethey hinge on superb game design that usually allows for tremendous experimentation that makes you think sometimes stealth games are an amalgamation of genres blending horror or action with slower more methodical gameplay theres something so satisfying about studying your enemies moves while carefully attempting to navigate throughout each level undetected however you slice it stealth games are often smart and inventivesince this genre is composed of so many outstanding games weve decided to take a look at some of the best it has to offer from newer releases to older titles from the era lets take a look at the best stealth games of all timerecommended readingkicking things off is a more recent entry hitman without spending all day gushing about this game because we totally could do that lets briefly cover why its so special for starters the game is composed of many largescale levels that typically consist of multiple floors across various realworld locations like dubai or england each stage requires you to eliminate at least one target but how you go about that is entirely up to youwant to walk in guns blazing with no regard for security or discretion go for it or perhaps youd rather stage the scene to look like an accident you can absolutely rig a metal walkway so your target tumbles below this gives the game so much replayability and rewards you for experimenting with the numerous ways to complete each objective from a design point of view hitman is hard to top better yet is playing it in psvrmetal gear solid snake eaterwhen it comes to famous stealth video game series it doesnt get any bigger than metal gear solid the first game is important and is worth playing but with it being an older playstation game time hasnt been as kind to it thats why we recommend the third installment metal gear solid snake eater whats cool about this game is that it takes place first chronologically meaning you can definitely get away with playing it before the others in this game youre sent to a deadly jungle full of crocodiles bats and of course snakes all of which can cause damage if you arent carefulone of snake eaters most memorable gameplay mechanics is its camouflage system which requires you to wear different clothing depending on your environment to conceal yourself more effectively for instance the animal camo works well around grass while the black camo is ideal for the dark this when combined with its deep and somber story add up to a wildly experimental game that stands the test of time more so than the first installmentdishonored may very well be the most underrated entry on this list this game and its predecessor dishonored give you a wonderfully crafted playground to explore with lots of options for getting past each obstacle while the first entry was beloved the second game gets a ton of praise particularly due to its two main characters emily and her father corvoyou can choose to play through the game with either character and each of them has unique abilities that warrant a second playthrough with the other however you choose to get through the game lethally or nonlethally theres lots to love in dishonored will you sneak past your enemies or will you attack them rambo style the choice is yoursdeus ex mankind dividedyou dont see stealth rpgs too often but thats exactly what you get with deus ex mankind divided one of the best things about this game is how it ties your characters upgrades to the level design itself youll find augments that enhance your hacking abilities to manipulate windows or grates opening up new possibilities for completing your objectivethis encourages experimentation not just from an exploration point of view but with its upgrades as well and lets be honest who wouldnt want to play as adam jensen a cybernetically enhanced agent with an awesome suit of course with this being a stealth game youve got plenty of options for approaching the games obstacles each with pros and cons that youll want to consider in many ways deus ex inspired cd projekt reds cyberpunk and you can see that clearly in this gametom clancys splinter cell blacklistfor some reason publisher ubisoft doesnt seem too interested in bringing back the splinter cell series the most recent entry splinter cell blacklist has a highstakes story a memorable and likable cast of characters and some of the best stealth gameplay the genre has seenas sam fisher you have tons of gadgets at your disposal such as proximity mines and firearms as well as nonlethal devices like a taser with that in mind youre able to complete the game without lethally eliminating your opponents and doing so gives you a nice challenge instead of simply blasting through the campaign aggressively its stealth gameplay at its finest so if youre wanting a more realistic take on the genre this is not one to skipalien isolationas one of the leading examples of survival horror stealth alien isolation has a sizable fan base thanks to its terrifying atmosphere and ability to keep you on the edge of your seat the idea of having to navigate through a large space vessel like the sevastopol while avoiding an everpresent xenomorph is absolutely horrifying and is part of why this game works so wellits almost like resident evil nemesis in that youre constantly being stalked by a huge opposing force alien isolation doesnt have a ton of combat and instead emphasizes stealth gameplay and exploration as a means to drive it forward youre often better off sneaking around your enemy rather than taking them headon though the method feels rewarding either way for that it deserves a spot on this listmetal gear solid v the phantom painfor our second metal gear solid entry on this list we wanted to touch on the fifth numbered installment metal gear solid v the phantom pain we fully recognize that this game is flawed and in some ways unfinished but when it comes to gameplay the phantom pain is in a league of its own much like hitman this game allows you to tackle objectives in a variety of ways but adds an open world to the mix because of that the possibilities of how you finish each mission are nearly endless thanks to the many systems in placeyou can use your environment and gadgets to distract your enemies which can alter the course of how the mission plays out or you can sneak through without even touching anyone since the open world is a huge factor in this game youve got multiple ways to get around including cars tanks and via horseback as long as you arent expecting a cohesive story the phantom pain will be up your alley if youre a fan of sandboxstyle stealth gamesmark of the ninjathe majority of this list is composed of realistic games in perspective but mark of the ninja stands on its own as a stealth platformer thats right this game takes the stealth genre to new heights and it does so in which is extremely impressive part of what makes this game so fun is the way it rewards you for effectively planning your routeyoure able to see into the rooms ahead giving you plenty of information to figure out how to approach each section if your plan goes awry it isnt the end of the world but its immensely satisfying when things go right thanks to mark of a ninjas clear ui its very easy to tell whether an enemy can see you and where you need to go it originally launched for xbox in but was remastered for xbox one and nintendo switch in incserving as one of the more unique entries on this list invisible inc is a turnbased tactical stealth game presented from a topdown isometric view based on that description alone it might already have your attention on top of that each level is randomly generated meaning no two runs are the sameeach party member you bring with you has various augments that work for various situations giving you agency with how you choose to build your squad invisible inc has a balanced difficulty that feels fair even if you get caught off guard you can utilize the rewind feature to start over from the beginning of your turn this limiteduse ability alleviates some of the frustrations that come with turnbased tactics games making it easier to get throughsekiro shadows die twiceonce again here we have a game that is a mixture of genres effectively blending stealth with intense skillbased action combat in sekiro shadows die twice most of what youll be doing is taking out enemies via handtohand combat but it does also have some nifty stealth sequences that are worth discussing in fact a lot of the game can be played stealthily if you so choose rewarding players for being patient since the combat is so skill dependent its typically beneficial to sneak past enemies rather than fighting themsekiro comes to us from veteran souls developer fromsoftware and you can definitely tell based solely on its difficulty when implementing stealth you can eliminate enemies quickly and efficiently clearing the path ahead without getting overrun though if you do have to take on an opponent headtohead youll find the combat to be complex and challenging giving you the best of both worldstenchu wrath of heavenbefore there was sekiro shadows die twice there was the tenchu series which clearly share a lot of the same dna in fact in japan fromsoftware actually published this entry tenchu wrath of heaven a game that launched in the spring of wrath of heaven is the third entry in the series following a similar format as before in it you play as a number of ninja characters who must stick to the shadows to get through levels undetected the better your performance the higher your rank at the end of a level plus better performance nets you with more rewards such as items to useits this system that makes the stealth gameplay so rewarding youre encouraged to get through without being seen you can certainly engage enemies head on and if you do it works well still but the main idea is to remain hidden within the shadows and it does this exceptionally well wrath of heaven might not hold up as well in but its still a blast and it paved the way for other ninja games that came afterthe last of uswe recognize that the last of us isnt primarily defined as a stealth game but when you consider the momenttomoment gameplay often requires you to sneak around enemies its hard to classify it any other way since its first and foremost a survival horror game its common for you to be low on supplies as you play so your best course of action is typically to avoid detection to preserve ammothis design decision adds to the tension because being caught could mean having to use precious resources that you might want to save for later all of this is tied to one of the most iconic video game stories in history the story of joel and ellie is tragic and monumental in the gravity it holds that story is expanded upon in the sequel the last of us part ii while that game was a bit more divisive among fans its still absolutely

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-minecraft-shaders-how-to-install/,"The best Minecraft shaders, and how to install them",despite its age minecraft continues to be one of the most popular games around not only has the core development team continued to pump out impressive content but players have been steadily developing their own mods over the past several years making the game bigger and more customizable than anyone could have ever imaginedone of the most exciting and easy to use types of minecraft mod is a graphics enhancement called a shader this gives the blocky world a brand new coat of paint and can range from realistic to ultracartoony a gigantic catalog of shaders has only grown larger with time and there no shortage of unique options to choose from nowadaysminecraftforge andor optifine modding managersof course not all shaders are equally up to the task so weve picked out some of our favorites to get started since shaders are a totally aesthetic change you may end up finding some of them not to your taste but theyre all guaranteed to make minecraft look like more than a familiar collection of blocksas with any minecraft mod youll need to do a little work to get prepared before you start installing shaders to install most minecraft mods you can use a mod manager called forge but for shaders and texture packs youll want to use a tool called optifine on its own optifine introduces some handy fixes to minecraft including increasing its frame rate but its also essential to allow shaders to work optifine can be used with or without forgehere what you need to know before installing minecraft shadersstep to install optifine head over to its official website and download the latest versionstep run the installer which will add a new version of minecraft to the minecraft launcherstep run the new version of optifine minecraft and you be able to play the game using any installed shadersstep shaders can easily be installed bydownloading a shader from your preferred sourcedragging the installed file to the shaderpacks folder in your minecraft installation this can be found by going to the options section of your optifine version of minecraft then clicking video settings shaders shaders folderonce the shader is placed there youre good to goneed some help finding the coolest shaders on the market here are a few of our favorites ranging from dark and moody to colorful and vibrantminecraft players who have any experience with shaders have almost certainly heard of sonic ethers unbelievable shaders already seus was one of the earliest shaders to hit the minecraft modding community and its remained one of the most popular visual overhauls ever since for good reason seus focuses on realistic lighting favoring subtle effects over the wild colors and contrast some other shaders produce theres even a new experimental version that supports ray tracing on any nvidia graphics card and another one designed to run without as much of a performance hitdownloadwhen it comes to photorealistic shaders for minecraft theres really no way around it continuum shaders are the best of the bunch it packs every topoftheline visual enhancement out there into a single mod while keeping everything nicely balanced so it doesnt just end up as a mishmash of pretty effects with pristine water realistic fog and clouds unbelievable shadows and vibrant but realistic colors continuum does everything right and is worth checking out even just to see how incredible minecraft can look under the right circumstances the downside because there has to be one is that its also one of the most resourceintensive mods around and is only really suitable for highend machines if youve got the gear for it though theres even a fully raytraced version of continuum and a custom highresolution texture pack built specifically for use with these shadersdownloadif youre aiming for the most realistic graphics in minecraft but your computer shrinks at the sight of continuum bsl shaders might be the mod for you like continuum bsl shaders offer the total package adding depth of field volumetric lighting bloom and pretty much any other fancy visual effect you can think of to completely overhaul minecrafts look bsl shaders would be easy to recommend in any case but what really makes them stand out is that they do all that while still running remarkably well so you can enjoy one of the most beautiful versions of minecraft out there on a less powerful computer bsl shaders are so good that they should basically be the default shader choice for most playersdownloadmany of the best minecraft shaders aim for a natural look that enhances the games visual style without totally transforming it sildurs vibrant shaders takes another route loading minecraft up with incredible effects until it almost looks like a different game with blownout lighting and saturated colors sildurs vibrant shaders is one of the most intense graphics mods out there for minecraft so it may not be for everyone but its also highly configurable for those who like the idea behind it but want to change things updownloadanother extremely popular choice kuda shaders aim for a mostly realistic look but there are a couple of areas where the mod really shines this shader gives minecrafts colors a noticeable but not overthetop boost makes shadows more dramatic and adds great water reflections though there are other shaders that do that better where few mods can match kuda shaders is in the sky thanks to the incredible clouds and atmosphere effects that make everything from sunrise to the full moon look absolutely incredibledownloadif you notice some similarities between projectluma and the previous entry kuda shaders theres a good reason for that projectluma is officially the successor to kuda shaders made by the same developer so the mod shares a lot of the same aesthetic its designed to provide the bestlooking game with a minimal performance hit and without the visual effects being too overwhelming its safe to say that projectluma succeeds on all fronts delivering an incrediblelooking game including kuda shaders signature skies without dragging performance down too muchdownloadthe nostalgia shader gives minecraft its own unique signature style rather than portraying a realistic look it does this by emphasizing its trademark blocky appearance and mimicking widely used decadeold shaders it can be hard to add mods to minecraft because it has such a distinct look so the nostalgia shader is a great way to slightly change your games interface without totally altering it it also has the benefit of being compatible with most machines because it lacks topnotch qualitydownloadoceano shader is relatively new to the world of minecraft shaders and lacks realism compared to popular shader packs however portraying realism isnt what its trying to do in any way instead oceano is working to boost the colors and ambiance of minecraft so you experience a beautiful unique gaming experience oceanos special water effects outperform other shaders too use this shader and the warm friendly environment that it gives minecraft will make you want to play for hours oceanos aesthetics arent for everyone but its unique presence can make other shaders with more realistic styles look dull and lacklusterdownloadnaelegos cel shaders mod is different from the others on this list because it doesnt just alter the look of minecraft it makes it look like a completely different game altogether instead of just livening minecrafts visuals it provides celshaded effects with exaggerated animated outlines around every piece of the game similar to borderlands you may not always be in the mood to use naelegos cel shaders when playing minecraft but with the unique truly individual appearance youll want to keep it on hand just in casedownload,en,636,Positive

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-ea-games/,The best EA games of all time,ea is one of the biggest publishers in the western gaming market they employ thousands of developers across dozens of studios to create games of nearly all sizes types and genres being around since nearly the beginning of the gaming medium itself their catalog of games is one of the largest in the industry and it only continues to grow as their teams produce more and more titles however they have earned a somewhat poor reputation in recent years among gamers for how they have treated some of their studios and franchisesas much hate as the company gets theres no denying the fact that some of gamings greatest games and franchises come from ea in recent years theyve even managed to start repairing their image in many gamers eyes thanks to pulling back on predatory business practices supporting and improving games that were not well received at launch and even giving us some traditional singleplayer experiences ea might have a few series theyre most known for but they make games for just about every market heres what we consider to be the best ea games of all timecall it cheating but the compilation of all three mass effect games in one package really is about the best deal you can get in terms of three good to amazing games in one bundle developed by bioware ea took the reigns on publishing this incredibly ambitious project that would not otherwise be possible there was so much risk involved here that it can be hard to see now that the series has reached a legendary pun intended status for one it was a new ip but even more than that was the pitch of it being a planned trilogy that would allow players to carry over their decisions from game to game the fact that this series even crossed the finish line let alone as strong as it did is still amazing to reflect onmass effect legendary editionnot only bundles the trilogy together we dont speak about andromedahere but updates them as much as they can for the and xbox one consolesmass effectin particular got a lot of love helping the clunky but beloved game hold up a bit better plus all story dlc was included with the only somewhat notable missing feature beingmass effect multiplayer mode that minor complaint aside this scifi epic stands as some of the best scifi writing worldbuilding and roleplaying ever developed this new edition just makes it that much easier for new players to finally experience it and returning players to replay it in a new waythis is where a distinction needs to be madetitanfall an absolutely amazing game made by respawn entertainment everything about how this game was marketed and released which ea controls was an absolute trash fire not only was it set to release during the busiest season for games but ea seemingly settitanfall release date specifically so that the game would fail not only was it put right up against eas other more wellestablished shooter franchise in battlefield but also the series games actively try to avoid releasing around call of duty infinite warfare granted that years call of duty wasnt the most popular entry in the series theres still no excuse for putting this gem between these two titans im on a roll todaytitanfall the whole package the singleplayer campaign which has become mostly an afterthought in modern fps games is considered one of the best fps campaigns since halflife thats a big statement to make but its true you obviously have the same fluid and creative movement options and tight shooting that youd get in the multiplayer mode but the creativity of the levels is amazing from a factory level where youre navigating through buildings as theyre being built around you to the infamous timeshifting level theres no wasted moment in this story thats not even touching on the multiplayer which combines the fastpaced action of a call of duty with advanced movement options and of course the titular titans that create matches that ride the line between feeling too out of control and empoweringread our full titanfall burnout takedownracing games along with sports games are some of the oldest games ever made in the racing genre there is somewhat of a split between racing sim and arcade racing with the absolute peak of arcade racing beingburnout takedown rather than try and replicate what a real street race would be like the burnout games embraced the overthetop highspeed highaction potential of cars going fast you arent racing on designated tracks here and traffic is just as much a part of the course as the turns the punishment for crashing is also toned down to a major degree with a quick cut to a cinematic shot of your crumpled vehicle flipping down the road and shooting up sparks before shoving you right back in the race at miles per hourbecauseburnout takedownwas already bending the rules of reality in its driving mechanics the developers figured they may as go all the way with it the boost meter isnt unique to arcade racers necessarily but the way you build it is perfect for the way the game is meant to be played by doing risky maneuvers such as driving on the wrong side of the road nailing a tight drift and taking out other racers you build up your nitro boost to hit blistering top speeds if you somehow got tired of the addicting racing modes there are also extra ways to play such as driving your car into a busy intersection and detonating yourself to try and cause as much damage as dead spaceout of the three dead space games it really comes down to the first two for which one is better we personally thinkdead spaceis the stronger game but not by much what edges it out at least in our opinion is the stronger emphasis on horror compared to the more action style the sequel adopted plus at the timedead spacewas kind of the only good survival horror game around the resident evil series had gone full action with the fifth game not to mention the sixth that came later and silent hill had been struggling ever since the daysdead spacewas in effect the real sequel toresident evil we all wanted but even that comparison kind of sells this game short for everything unique it doesplaying as space engineer not marine isaac clark you and a small team are sent to investigate the goingson in a giant mining ship called the usg ishimura naturally the problems you encounter once onboard are way more dire than any mechanical failings but youre still only armed with your repair tools to defend yourself the games true selling point was how you used these tools to fight the twisted necromorphs unlike almost any other shooter horror or otherwise aiming for the head wont do you much good instead dead spacewas all about limb dismemberment only but cutting off legs and arms were you able to effectively stop these monsters from ripping isaac battlefield bad company one of the longestrunning fps franchises on the market it is a big task to even make a list of which battlefield game is the best let alone pit them against all the other games ea puts out when it comes down to it though we never had as much fun with the franchise as we did with battlefield bad company the originalbad companywas the first to really push dices frostbite engine by introducing a level of destructibility never seen before it may be commonplace today and has even become far more dynamic and involved but blowing holes in buildings or even causing them to completely collapse was mindblowingbattlefield bad company marks the last time there was in our opinion an actually decent story in a battlefield game while not quite as lighthearted as the first it still gave us actual characters on a pretty interesting mission through tons of varied locations and situations but its the multiplayer most people come to battlefield for and man did they ever nail it here you have the usual class system with rpg style unlock mechanics that felt fair and not overly grindy large scale maps fun modes and that chaotic action of a tank blowing a hole in the wall beside you causing the sound to drop out as someone else hits it with an rpg and you pick off an enemy who managed to jump out just in star wars jedi fallen orderfor the majority of the time ea held the exclusive rights to make games based on the star wars license gamers were not happy with their treatment of the beloved ip the original star wars battlefrontwas okay but very light on content had no single player and only really excelled in being a visual and auditory feast for fans of star wars the sequel well the problems with that game would take almost too long to cover dice did manage to pull back and undo a lot of the mistakes that game made but the consensus had already been set on that game and there was little that could be done to repair it enter respawn appearing for the second but not last time on this list finally delivering what fans have wanted for years a singleplayer storydriven star wars gameset between the prequel and original trilogystar wars jedi fallen orderdelicately balances itself between some of the most hated and beloved moments in the franchise thanks to the smart decision to not interfere with either of these sides much at all this new adventure has been welcomed into the cannon with open arms by most fans in terms of gameplay it is about as good as it gets for a star wars game taking elements from souls games plus some setpiece cues from series like uncharted and tomb raider with a splash of metroidvania this is just a fun

innovative and modern iteration the series has had in a long time which is saying something for an annual franchise based on a sport that doesnt really see any major changesthis entry was when a lot of major gameplay improvements were made specifically to the passing system that gave players way more control over their plays you had new quarterback systems and throws that would change depending on the situation plus more options to pull off more clutch passes when the defense was closing in there was also the connected franchise mode where you would build up your team to be the best in the league by essentially leveling up your players with training points being on the modern systems you obviously had plenty of online options as well to keep the game going unlike most previous and some later games madden nfl just a fresh coat of paint and roster update in a fullpriced package editors recommendations the best pokmon games ranked from best to worst the best nintendo switch games for kids the best multiplayer games on nintendo switch can you play switch sports on a nintendo switch lite the best party games for nintendo switchracing games along with sports games are some of the oldest games ever made in the racing genre there is somewhat of a split between racing sim and arcade racing with the absolute peak of arcade racing beingburnout takedown rather than try and replicate what a real street race would be like the burnout games embraced the overthetop highspeed highaction potential of cars going fast you arent racing on designated tracks here and traffic is just as much a part of the course as the turns the punishment for crashing is also toned down to a major degree with a quick cut to a cinematic shot of your crumpled vehicle flipping down the road and shooting up sparks before shoving you right back in the race at miles per hourbecauseburnout takedownwas already bending the rules of reality in its driving mechanics the developers figured they may as go all the way with it the boost meter isnt unique to arcade racers necessarily but the way you build it is perfect for the way the game is meant to be played by doing risky maneuvers such as driving on the wrong side of the road nailing a tight drift and taking out other racers you build up your nitro boost to hit blistering top speeds if you somehow got tired of the addicting racing modes there are also extra ways to play such as driving your car into a busy intersection and detonating yourself to try and cause as much damage as dead spaceout of the three dead space games it really comes down to the first two for which one is better we personally thinkdead spaceis the stronger game but not by much what edges it out at least in our opinion is the stronger emphasis on horror compared to the more action style the sequel adopted plus at the timedead spacewas kind of the only good survival horror game around the resident evil series had gone full action with the fifth game not to mention the sixth that came later and silent hill had been struggling ever since the daysdead spacewas in effect the real sequel toresident evil we all wanted but even that comparison kind of sells this game short for everything unique it doesplaying as space engineer not marine isaac clark you and a small team are sent to investigate the goingson in a giant mining ship called the usg ishimura naturally the problems you encounter once onboard are way more dire than any mechanical failings but youre still only armed with your repair tools to defend yourself the games true selling point was how you used these tools to fight the twisted necromorphs unlike almost any other shooter horror or otherwise aiming for the head wont do you much good instead dead spacewas all about limb dismemberment only but cutting off legs and arms were you able to effectively stop these monsters from ripping isaac battlefield bad company one of the longestrunning fps franchises on the market it is a big task to even make a list of which battlefield game is the best let alone pit them against all the other games ea puts out when it comes down to it though we never had as much fun with the franchise as we did with battlefield bad company the originalbad companywas the first to really push dices frostbite engine by introducing a level of destructibility never seen before it may be commonplace today and has even become far more dynamic and involved but blowing holes in buildings or even causing them to completely collapse was mindblowingbattlefield bad company marks the last time there was in our opinion an actually decent story in a battlefield game while not quite as lighthearted as the first it still gave us actual characters on a pretty interesting mission through tons of varied locations and situations but its the multiplayer most people come to battlefield for and man did they ever nail it here you have the usual class system with rpg style unlock mechanics that felt fair and not overly

market it is a big task to even make a list of which battlefield game is the best let alone pit them against all the other games ea puts out when it comes down to it though we never had as much fun with the franchise as we did with battlefield bad company the originalbad companywas the first to really push dices frostbite engine by introducing a level of destructibility never seen before it may be commonplace today and has even become far more dynamic and involved but blowing holes in buildings or even causing them to completely collapse was mindblowingbattlefield bad company marks the last time there was in our opinion an actually decent story in a battlefield game while not quite as lighthearted as the first it still gave us actual characters on a pretty interesting mission through tons of varied locations and situations but its the multiplayer most people come to battlefield for and man did they ever nail it here you have the usual class system with rpg style unlock mechanics that felt fair and not overly grindy large scale maps fun modes and that chaotic action of a tank blowing a hole in the wall beside you causing the sound to drop out as someone else hits it with an rpg and you pick off an enemy who managed to jump out just in timefor the majority of the time ea held the exclusive rights to make games based on the star wars license gamers were not happy with their treatment of the beloved ip the original star wars battlefrontwas okay but very light on content had no single player and only really excelled in being a visual and auditory feast for fans of star wars the sequel well the problems with that game would take almost too long to cover dice did manage to pull back and undo a lot of the mistakes that game made but the consensus had already been set on that game and there was little that could be done to repair it enter respawn appearing for the second but not last time on this list finally delivering what fans have wanted for years a

franchise thanks to the smart decision to not interfere with either of these sides much at all this new adventure has been welcomed into the cannon with open arms by most fans in terms of gameplay it is about as good as it gets for a star wars game taking elements from souls games plus some setpiece cues from series like uncharted and tomb raider with a splash of metroidvania this is just a fun

on creating a brand new fantasy world after successfully introducing their very own scifi universe in mass effect the team certainly had plenty of experience developing games in this setting having worked on multiple dungeons and dragons games so when they struck out to do their own thing withdragon age origins they naturally knew what they were doing it was slightly less ambitious as the mass

than consolesthe story is mostly standard fantasy fare but with the bioware twist of strong characters great worldbuilding and lore and of course choices that can influence the game this is also where

time with the corresponding symbol on some kind of track a few games got a little creative with it substituting the actual buttons with things like hazards that you had to avoid to the rhythm but for the most part the genre was mostly stale and not all that popular enter guitar heroand its plastic instruments and suddenly this dormant genre was catapulted to the top of the chartsas good as the guitar hero series was it was only a matter of time before the next natural step was taken to allow all the major instruments to be played sure that meant even more expensive peripherals but the approachable party style fun of gathering some friends to play your favorite songs was enough for millions of people to put down the extra cashrock band last one ea published developed by the masters

is exactly what it needs to be digital trends giovanni colantonio wrote in a threeandahalf star review for the game its an intuitive package of wiiera sports minigames with more precise motion controls and full online integration addictive activities like bowling and badminton make it one of the switchs best multiplayer party games though overly complicated minigames like soccer miss the simple appeal of the serieswii sports is one of the most ubiquitous video games out there so its good to know that nintendo switch sports lives up to the name even if it doesnt reinvent the formula this is not a complex title but its the next great multiplayer party game for nintendo switchthe latest lego title from tt games has been a long time coming and its scope matches the development time lego star wars the skywalker saga features retellings of all nine classic mainline star wars films in a massive game full of large hub worlds based on iconic planets it doesnt always mesh together well but theres certainly no shortage of fun to be had herelego star wars the skywalker saga is the most engaging lego game in years thanks to its deeper gameplay and all of the faithfully recreated star wars locales that players can explore i wrote in a threestar review but like the protagonists of each star wars trilogy the skywalker saga has an identity crisisalthough i was a little more mixed on the game than some the skywalker saga certainly has its merits and will be a delightful game for kids and families if youre a diehard star wars fan and plan to spend a lot of time exploring once

discussing how mlb the show is a fantastic fit for xbox game pass the pitching batting and fielding all have a lot of depth and different control schemes even if these mechanics are the same as last yearsit wont blow you away but this is another excellent baseball simulation for fans of the sport thats as relaxing or exhilarating as they want it to be and now that its on both xbox game pass and nintendo switch mlb the show is available to almost anyone hopefully we get a pc port next yearteardown is one of several standout indie games to exit early access this month in it players pull off heists in levels that have completely destructible environments that detailed level of destruction gives the player a ton of freedom in accomplishing objectives making it a memorable immersive simit

everything this heist sandbox offerscitybuilder games like cities skylines can often get overwhelming and be exhausting to play dorfromantik takes this concept in the opposite direction presenting a

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/kingdom-hearts-4-release-date-trailer-gameplay-news/,Everything we know about Kingdom Hearts IV,fans of the kingdom hearts titles are used to waiting extremely long times between mainline releases after kingdom hearts ii on the the series veered into spinoff territory with no proper sequel for the entire generation finally in we got the longawaited conclusion to what we would learn was the dark seeker saga however in typical kingdom hearts fashion the end of the saga was by no means the end of the story for sora riku kairi and all their disney and final fantasy friends both a secret ending boss and dlc all pointed toward a new era on the horizon the only question was how long it would take until we saw what it would befor kingdom hearts anniversary event fans were treated to something most didnt expect to see so soon a full reveal of kingdom hearts iv not a side story prequel interlude or dream but an actual direct continuation from where kingdom hearts iii appeared to leave off not only did square enix simply state that the game existed but a full trailer was also shown this trailer is short but packed with information and things to speculate about the full picture isnt clear yet but weve unlocked all the secrets we can so far to share everything we know about kingdom hearts iv and the new lost master arcthe big downer for the reveal of kingdom hearts ivis that no release date was given theres not even a window of what year square enix thinks this title might be ready however we can speculate a bit in our hearts we dont see this game coming out before on one hand we do see what looks to be real though clearly early gameplay in the trailer on the other hand there are reports that the game is currently using unreal engine but is planning on switching to unreal engine while that transfer is supposedly not too difficult it will probably take some time and create some setbacks in the process either way it wouldnt be the first time we got a trailer way way in advance of a kingdom hearts game actually coming outthere are no platforms announced for kingdom hearts iv yet the kingdom hearts series has traditionally been playstation only but kingdom hearts iii launched on both xbox one and and came to switch and pc later past games in the series have also recently been ported to xbox and pc and it seems like the point of bringing the entire series to these new platforms was to build up those audiences for a new kingdom hearts iv we wont know for sure until later but we think this could easily come to all platforms maybe even switch via streaming simultaneously or close to itaside from that this should be a currentgen exclusive given the minimum two years we predict before this game comes out we should be far enough past the and xbox one to have fully dedicated currentgen gamesthe announcement trailer from the anniversary event in japan is so far all we have in terms of footage even so theres quite a bit of interesting stuff packed in this short teaser at the end of a series of trailersonce we get to the kingdom hearts iv section we open with the direct message of this being the lost master arc we see some breathtaking shots of the same modernday city heavily inspired by tokyo we saw briefly in the secret ending of kingdom hearts iii which we learn is named quadratum a voiceover which is hard to place as familiar due to it being in japanese talks in typical cryptic kingdom hearts style apparently talking to sora the voice advises him to leave that world if hes too full of despair meanwhile a giant dark mass forms in the sky before we cut to more text stating the heart resides within the soul which in turn is guided by fate to its rightful placenew footage of another amazingly realized forest location with a waterfall and river is shown we cut to sora for the first time asleep on a couch sporting a new outfit he opens his door to a mysterious redhaired girl named strelitzia apparently an important character in kingdom hearts union cross who fills him in on the fact that hes been sleeping for a full week since he appeared in that world she describes the world as something like an after world for people like them perhaps implying that she isnt from quadratum either during an interview with famitsu tetsuya nomura commented on what this new world was stating from soras perspective quadratum is an underworld a fictional world that is different from reality but from the point of view of the inhabitants on the quadratum side the world of quadratum is reality and the world where sora and the others were is the other side the fictional world i think the theme of this project will be the contrast between those who are in such different positions this seems to be pointing towards the fact that this world was seen in kingdom hearts as the fictional location of a fake game inside the toy story world called verum rexthe black mass from before returns now forming into a more disfigured version of something like the darkside enemy from past games terrorizing the people on the street and lifting cars with dark powers sora the hero at heart that he is rushes in to do battle summoning his iconic keybladeas the fight comes to an end the voiceover continues and we see two cloaked figures wearing the same black coats as organization xiii once did he finishes by saying that if sora decides to leave that world he shouldnt expect to go back to the one he came fromafter the title drop we get a tiny bit more footage of donald and goofy wandering around a pitch black environment looking for someone only referred to as he that they hope can help them a blue flame sparks behind them catching their attention before a voice asks where they think theyre going the pair appear frightened already but freak out after turning around and the blue fire erupts into a red blazethe final words to cap it all off are magic in the makingin terms of story well things are complicated to start off the name of this new arc the lost master arc probably refers to a character known as the master of masters who was a keyblade master from kingdom hearts x he wrote something called the book of prophecies and only showed up in the mainline games during the ending of kingdom hearts iii in a cloak how this plays into well anything is beyond our knowledgeconsidering kairis fate at the end of kingdom hearts iiiand soras at the end of the remind dlc its clear that the reason sora is in quadratum at least initially is to reunite once again with kairi obviously things wont go to plan though all we can hope for now is that this new arc can cut down on the overly complex nature the first arc had at least a little bitas for donald and goofy all signs point to them either looking for or at least accidentally encountering hades the blue flame feels like a dead giveaway despite us not being familiar with the japanese voice why they would be looking for him or looking for someone in the underworld could be anything hades has shown to be tied in with the series biggest bad guys in a way the other disney villains arent and weve never thwarted him for good so hes a solid pick to bring backnomura had more to say on what the pair are doing plus commented on soras new design as well donald and goofy are looking for clues about sora in the original world he explained all the real worlds before the title display in the trailer are all quadratum segments and sora will look realistic but if he can return to the original world he will look like donald and goofy with shaders like donald and goofy this is all consistent with how sora and crews appearances change to reflect whatever world they are in throughout the seriesa fair bit of the trailer was at least made to look like gameplay though it can be a little hard to believe based on how good it looked at the very least we expect plenty of changes between this and the final product but itssafe to say big things are comingas suspected normura has stated that the apartment in quadratum we find sora resting in will be this games hub of sorts at least for the beginning portion of the game this area is not in shibuya itself but another part of the city called minamiaoyamafirst the slowmotion style of movement from dream drop distance and kingdom hearts iii is back but smoother than ever sora leaps spins slides and even uses his keyblade as a grappling hook to seamlessly glide around the city environment quicktime events or reaction commands maybe seem to be coming back we see sora counter the giant heartlesss punch by transforming his keyblade into a drill hinting that form changes will also be coming back before launching it like a missileunfortunately we dont get to see the end of the fight but the scale and spectacle look beyond anything weve seen yetthe ui is also on screen but looks identical to the kingdom hearts iiiversion leading us to believe it is a placeholder for now unfortunately we cant read any of the text on the ui so if there is anything exciting there sorryalso besides quadratum the only other world we see is that forest area eagleeyed viewers noticed one strange detail in a shot of the river that looks a lot like the foot of an atat the mechanical walking tanks from the star wars series this would be the first time the kingdom hearts series has crossed over with that franchise but considering it is a disney property is completely possible again that is pure speculation no worlds outside quadratum are confirmed but its possible sora might get his first lightsaber keyblade you can judge for yourself by looking at the top right of the above screenshotkingdom hearts iv shouldnt have any multiplayer modes the only games in the series that did have them were spinoff titles and even then they were sectioned off to minigames and arena challenges this series has always been about the story characters and adventure so we hope it remains true to that unless it does include some odd side games that have no relation or impact on the main story wed prefer a pure focused singleplayer experience still we cant say for sure until square enix confirms it one way or the otherkingdom hearts iii was the first title to get any dlc and it turned out to be really good if it is handled the same way for kingdom hearts iv with it being mostly postgame content and the ability to play as new characters wed be all for some dlc later on to bring us back into the world of kingdom hearts personally we feel its way past due for riku to star in his own story if he doesnt at least appear as a playable character in the main game again this is all wild speculationwere years off from kingdom hearts ivgracing our screens and hearts though it pains us to say it there wont be any news on how to preorder kingdom hearts ivfor quite a while based on past games though you should be looking forward to any special editions they announce if they keep up with their past ones there will be some awesome goodies included that any major kingdom hearts fan will want once they do show up well let you know all the

version was toned down thematically it still carried an m rating from the esrb and is one of the bloodiest games to hit the console duke nukem all about destruction and chaos most environmental props could be blown to smithereens and the onslaught of enemies was near relentless the best part about the port though was the inclusion of twoplayer couch coop running and gunning with a friend significantly upped the fun factor of course duke nukem got its legs from its fourplayer deathmatch although not nearly as popular as golden or perfect dark duke nukem offered highly entertaining competitive multiplayerthough pc gamers had enjoyed firstperson shooters for some time console gamers were relatively unaware of them beforegoldeneye on the scene in it was released nearly two years

trying to knock your opponents off an island or avoiding various obstacles while tightrope walking mario partys minigames had it all the game also did a fantastic job of keeping everybody on a level

everythingwhich kept bringing you back tomario kart thegame went on to become the second bestselling game on the and its not tough to see whywhile not the best racing game on fzero x could claim the title of fastest and most intense the sequel to the snes classic fzero x brought the series to familiar trend huh no one would call the transition to pretty however as the game looked downright bland in many spots the racer more than made up for its relative drabness with its gameplay though did you know that before burnouts highly popular takedown mode was created you could smash up futuristic ships in maniacal fzero death racesin addition to these racer freeforalls fzero x also had a degree of procedural generation in its track composition when playing xcup pieces and parts of tracks were

fact wave race launched about a month after the console itself and remains one of the systems marquee games the game featured just four playable characters each with their own predetermined racing style to go along with eight different courses in championship mode players raced through a selection of tracks and acquired points based on their finishing position depending on the level of difficulty players amassed a certain number of points to avoid disqualification and ending the game the concepts were simple but it took skill to beat the game on the harder difficulty levelswave races replay value rested solely with its time trial stunt and versus modes in stunt mode players raced around the games unlocked tracks and attempted to earn as many points as possible by executing various tricks and jumping through hoops a final score came down to the number of hoops a racer jumped through coupled with the number of successfully executed tricks putting down your controller

digitaltrends,2022/05/04,https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/the-best-bioware-games-of-all-time/,The best Bioware games of all time,bioware has been one of the most prominent western developers of rpgs for decades now they made their mark on the industry early on by crafting deep stories told with a level of writing that was otherwise absent from video games as a whole not only were they masters of crafting original stories but they even managed to inject new ideas and twists on existing franchises in those early days bioware was strictly a pc developer but have slowly transitioned into developing more consolefocused experiences and are arguably more known now for these games than their earlier worksafter so many years releasing dozens of games bioware has given us some absolute classics as well as some major disappointments no developer is perfect and bioware is proof that even sequels to critically acclaimed games can fall short of their predecessor for one reason or another we felt it was time to look over the entire bioware catalogue and list their best games of alltime the top spots in this list in particular were hard to put in order and depending on the franchise setting or gameplay style you will probably order them slightly differently but for the most part the games at the top of this list are agreed to be among the best this developer has ever madetaking on the star wars license especially at the time bioware did was certainly an intimidating task on one hand you have the almost legendary status of the original trilogy to live up to but also the poor taste to overcome that the prequels left on the many in the fanbase in an effort to avoid retreading old ground and potentially angering fans the team at bioware made the genius decision to place their original star wars game thousands of years before the events of any film that gave them complete freedom to tell their own unique star wars story without having to worry about contradicting any existing lorestar wars knights of the old republicis rightfully placed among the best media related to star wars ever created the story of your character who begins the game with amnesia is fully driven by your choices and actions depending on what you do or dont do you will either tend more toward the light side or the dark side of the force but even then you never even have to wield a lightsaber if you dont want to the combat is basic but with tons of different builds and skills to experiment with we cant forget the cast of party members either alone is worth the price of admission but the rest of your crew are worth investing some time in as well all told star wars knights of the old republicset the blueprint for what the best of the best bioware games would do in terms of character choice and rpg mechanics but elevated for being better than most films in the franchise it is based mass effect xbox one xbox pcof the mass effect trilogy theres an argument to be made between the first and second games as to which people prefer the majority it seems at least consider the second one to be the standout however thanks to it being the most balanced game bioware had made up until that point of satisfying gameplay alongside their strong writing and meaningful decisions those who prefer the first game often cite the deeper level of rpg systems such as allocating skill points and the like which was all streamlined in mass effect but that helped the series reach a much wider audience that was expecting a more polished shooter experiencein terms of story while the overall plot ofmass effect in a somewhat weird spot as the middle chapter of a planned trilogy it still managed to satisfy most players and get them ready for the final installment bioware did somewhat slip by having an integral story beat added as dlc which not everyone would get leading to some confusion as to what happened between games speaking of dlc though this is where lair of the shadowbroker came which on its own is seen as one of the best dlcs ever released just about everything in mass effect improved from the cast side quests and removal of the mako to name a few while we would never recommend skipping the first game many people enjoyed the series just fine jumping in at mass effect baldurs gate shadows of amn pcask any older pc gamer or many western rpg developers what the most influential rpgs of all time are and theres a very good chance theyll mentionbaldurs gate shadows of amn even people who have never played a baldurs gate game probably have heard the high levels of praise this game continues to get for just how good it is to date it is still the highest scoring pc game of all time on metacritic and second best if you narrow that down to just rpgs while bioware would eventually have a hit and miss relationship with sequelsbaldurs gate is their strongest one everset in the titular dungeons and dragons setting baldurs gate the peak of translating the full pen and paper role playing experience into a digital space sure you cant doanythingyou can think of like in a traditional game of dungeons and dragons but this game comes really close you have a wide cast of characters of different personalities races classes and relationships to accompany you on the conclusion to the bhaalspawn quest started in the first game you can even bring forward your character from that game too which was still a novel concept at the time the influence of this series is so strong that a third game developed by another studio is currently in production if you have the means to you wont regret going back to this mass effect xbox one xbox pcstarting a new franchise isnt easy starting a new franchise that is planned to be a trilogy of games is almost begging for failure and yet bioware managed to do the impossible with the firstmass effect not only did they create their own entire universe with a host of races each with their own unique traits and histories that intertwine in various ways but insert you into it without overburdening the player with hours of boring exposition or text yes there is a very extensive codex with pages of lore to read through but thats only for players who want to really get into the details of things if you just want to play the story everything you need to know is presented organicallymass effectwas a vital step in biowares transition into developing in the console space it wasnt their first game that came to consoles but was certainly their biggest and most ambitious they had to find a way to balance the complexity that their computer rpg players expected from their games but the accessibility and more direct action that console players craved while the gunplay was quite stiff with not all that interesting or dynamic ai to fight against and the menus a bit clunky there was no other game that offered the same experience mass effectdid way back when it launched thanks to thelegendary edition this first game is even more polished up dragon age origins xbox pccementing the late as the peak of biowares talents not only did they create an entire scifi universe with the brand newmass effectbut launched their very own dark fantasy epic as well in the form ofdragon age origins just likemass effectwas to their work on their star wars gamedragon age originswas bioware proving they didnt need an ip like dungeons and dragons to make an amazing medievalstyle rpg the team took many lessons they had learned with their work on the evolving mass effect series and refined and adapted many familiar systems into a game that was more than just a mass effect game only with swords and magic the combat in particular which leaned more on their classic rpg roots was the perfect level of complexity for console playersof course both games had great stories but dragon age origins took a few lessons from howmass effecthandled the finer details and made them their own romance options in particular became much more of a focus with a wider cast of characters you could or depending on your created character couldnt develop a romantic relationship with they also ditched the binary morality systems of going renegade or paragon but kept the same level of choice in action and dialogue that meant that players wouldnt feel as much of a need to choose one option or path over another just to get more morality points leading to more organic and true role baldurs gate pcthe game that started it all baldurs gatewas probably the best rpg anyone ever saw or would see right up until baldurs gate released two years later this game set up so many standards for the genre that we almost forget they had to come from somewhere before this game and the infinity engine that powered it there were no rpgs using the now standard isometric viewpoint and prerendered backgrounds to deliver levels of graphics otherwise unheard of this is also where the mixed real and paused time combat system would start which bioware itself would use in many iterations for yearswhile some other contemporary games attempted similar things such as the originalfallout it was baldurs gatethat actually tied all these systems and techniques together with a mature story that respected the player but also demanded respect in return the writing was diverse sometimes hilarious and other times morose but always captivating rpgs were not a powerhouse genre at the time so baldurs gatehad a lot to prove to be successful not only did the game overcome sales predictions but paved the way for the entire genre to see a resurgence in dragon age inquisition xbox one xbox pcafter a notable misstep with the sequel which youll find near the end of this list bioware came back strong with dragon age inquisition taking full advantage of the then new consoles the team had a lot to prove if they wanted to keep this series alive and they managed to deliver on almost all fronts yes this was obviously the biggest best looking and longest game in the series but the newest quest in the world of thedas was more than just a technical upgrade the story returned to being a sprawling epic involving tons of characters evil forces and political intrigue in all the waysdragon age fansinquisitionalmost seemed designed to rectifyyoull play a new character as is typical who is specially equipped to deal with a new threat entering the world through magical tears in reality you main quest is to recruit forces to aid you so you can close this breach which allows demons to enter the world these new characters are a return to form in character writing for bioware with new fan favorites popping up such as iron bull the romance system is again back with more depth and content and so much content that memes were created about leaving the hinterlands so players didnt burn themselves out trying to do everything in the first zone the main disappointment at least comparatively was the combat it was felt like a bit of a step back for bioware as a whole but is certainly serviceable to carry you through the engaging storyread our full dragon age neverwinter nights xbox one switch pcanother game taking place in a classic dungeons and dragons setting like the baldurs gate gamesneverwinter nightsisnt quite the groundbreaking rpg that those previous titles were despite much greater ambitions this game was biowares first real attempt at something like an mmo more on their first true mmo outing next and allowed you to connect with up to other players on a single server back in when this game came out that amount of players was quite staggering but the multiplayer was just one part of this package it of course offered a gripping single player story mode with gameplay based on the edition of dungeons and dragonswhat kept individuals and all their friends on these massive servers coming back after the campaign was done was the tools bioware included in the game that allowed

without much variety or complexity in that dragon age xbox pcthe infamous tale ofdragon age is one fans of the original game dont need retread and yet the result is still a major disappointment no matter what angle you look at it from in fairness this wasnt biowares fault the game was originally just going to be dlc for the first game then grew into something more sizable and shifted into a standalone expansion but ea apparently stepped in and mandated that it be made into a full sequel not only that but the timeline for the entire project was a mere nine months with all those factors in mind we should be praising bioware for releasing a game that even functions let alone is as coherent as dragon age thats not what gamers do instead just looking at the game as what it is a piece of entertainment it is a massive disappointment the way some mechanics seemed to regress made this sequel feel more like the first game in a series rather than a successor the writing was all over the place with some actually good beats sprinkled in there but lost among poor pacing and stretches of treading water playing the game was okay but the environments were rightfully criticized for being extremely repetitive youd delve into the same exact dungeons time and time again fighting the same monster types in wave after wave the world still had tons of promise but dragon age didnt make you

givingmass effect credit here the absolute low point was the spinoffsequel of sorts mass effect andromeda having written themselves into a spot where a true sequel to their trilogy was basically impossible and rather than create a prequel it was decided to follow a mission launched during the events ofmass effect of the familiar milky way galaxy and into the titular andromeda galaxy where the game couldnt impact or be impacted by any events going on in the main series the fact that this game didnt mess with anything regarding the main series is about all thats good about itok that may be a bitharsh but only just so you play as either the brother or sister ryder twins this time around looking for new habitable planets in this uncharted galaxy instead you and your expedition find new foes to deal with and theyre far less interesting than the reapers the kett one of the few actually new races you meet in this game are generic alien baddies along with other mysterious threats like the

but even those were cancelled leaving this game to sonic chronicles the dark brotherhood dswe just had to mention this one for the sheer absurdity of it even existing it almost sounds like a fake headline to say that bioware the makers of heavily narrative rpgs were making a sonic game and yet it is true regardless of the how or why this unholy collaboration actually exists and is as bad as it sounds theres just no part of this formula that makes sense either bioware would need to make a platformer which they never have or sonic the character marketed on being fast would be put into an rpg we suppose what we got a turnbased rpg starring sonic would be better than bioware trying to make a highspeed platformer but thats not saying muchthankfully this game manage to avoid most peoples attention becausesonic chronicles the dark brotherhoodis a game made for no one if you were a bioware fan youd just bored by how basic and brainless of an rpg this game is compared to what you came to expect from this team the only twist on combat was the inclusion of some timing based prompts you needed to hit but otherwise was clearly aimed at an audience unfamiliar with rpgs as a whole for sonic fans the weirdly deep story isnt what would draw them to an adventure starring a blue hedgehog that runs really fast and despite the simplicity also wouldnt be grabbed by the tediously slow rpg battles taking the place of high speed obstacle courses tuck this game away as a bit of odd trivia but otherwise stay away from this one editors recommendations xboxs new wireless controller is pretty

mass effect trilogy theres an argument to be made between the first and second games as to which people prefer the majority it seems at least consider the second one to be the standout however thanks to it being the most balanced game bioware had made up until that point of satisfying gameplay alongside their strong writing and meaningful decisions those who prefer the first game often cite the deeper level of rpg systems such as allocating skill points and the like which was all streamlined in mass effect but that helped the series reach a much wider audience that was expecting a more polished shooter experiencein terms of story while the overall plot ofmass effect in a somewhat weird spot as the middle chapter of a planned trilogy it still managed to satisfy most players and get them ready for the final installment bioware did somewhat slip by having an integral story beat added as dlc which not everyone would get leading to some confusion as to what happened between games speaking of dlc though this is where lair of the shadowbroker came which on its own is seen as one of the best dlcs ever released just about everything in mass effect improved from the cast side quests and removal of the mako to name a few while we would never recommend skipping the first game many people enjoyed the series just fine jumping in at mass effect baldurs gate shadows of amn pcask

ambitious they had to find a way to balance the complexity that their computer rpg players expected from their games but the accessibility and more direct action that console players craved while the gunplay was quite stiff with not all that interesting or dynamic ai to fight against and the menus a bit clunky there was no other game that offered the same experience mass effectdid way back when it

their own romance options in particular became much more of a focus with a wider cast of characters you could or depending on your created character couldnt develop a romantic relationship with they

option or path over another just to get more morality points leading to more organic and true role baldurs gate pcthe game that started it all baldurs gatewas probably the best rpg anyone ever saw or

monitorscementing the late as the peak of biowares talents not only did they create an entire scifi universe with the brand newmass effectbut launched their very own dark fantasy epic as well in the form ofdragon age origins just likemass effectwas to their work on their star wars gamedragon age originswas bioware proving they didnt need an ip like dungeons and dragons to make an amazing medievalstyle rpg the team took many lessons they had learned with their work on the evolving mass effect series and refined and adapted many familiar systems into a game that was more than just a mass effect game only with swords and magic the combat in particular which leaned more on their classic rpg roots was the perfect level of complexity for console playersof course both games had great stories but dragon age origins took a few lessons from howmass effecthandled the finer details and made them their own romance options in particular became much more of a focus with a wider cast of characters you could or depending on your created character couldnt develop a romantic relationship with they also ditched the binary morality systems of going renegade or paragon but kept the same level of choice in action and dialogue that meant that players wouldnt feel as much of a need to choose one option or path over another just to get more morality points leading to more organic and true role playingthe game that started it all baldurs gatewas probably the best rpg anyone ever saw or would see right up until baldurs gate released two years later this game set up so many standards for the genre that we almost forget they had to come from somewhere before this game and the infinity engine that powered it there were no rpgs using the now standard isometric viewpoint and prerendered backgrounds to deliver levels of graphics otherwise unheard of this is also where the mixed real and paused time combat system would start which bioware itself would use in many iterations for yearswhile some other contemporary games attempted similar things such as the originalfallout it was baldurs gatethat actually tied all these systems and techniques together with a mature story that respected the player but also demanded respect in return the writing was diverse sometimes hilarious and other times morose but always captivating rpgs were not a powerhouse genre at the time so baldurs gatehad a lot to prove to be successful not only did the game overcome sales predictions but paved the way for the entire genre to see a resurgence in popularityafter a notable misstep with the sequel which youll find near the end of this list bioware came back strong with dragon age inquisition taking full advantage of the then new consoles the team had a lot to prove if they wanted to keep this series alive and they managed to deliver on almost all fronts yes this was obviously the biggest best looking and longest game in the series but the newest quest in the world of thedas was more than just a technical upgrade the story returned to being a sprawling epic involving tons of characters evil forces and political intrigue in all the waysdragon age fansinquisitionalmost seemed designed to rectifyyoull play a new character as is typical who is specially equipped to deal with a new threat entering the world through magical tears in reality you main quest is to recruit forces to aid you so you can close this breach which allows demons to enter the world these new characters are a return to form in character writing for bioware with new fan favorites popping up such as iron bull the romance system is again back with more depth and content and so much content that memes were created about leaving the hinterlands so players didnt burn themselves out trying to do everything in the first zone the main disappointment at least comparatively was the combat it was felt like a bit of a step back for bioware as a whole but is certainly serviceable to carry you through the

of course offered a gripping single player story mode with gameplay based on the edition of dungeons and dragonswhat kept individuals and all their friends on these massive servers coming back after the campaign was done was the tools bioware included in the game that allowed players to expand the experience almost indefinitely the builtin tools for modding the game let players create entirely new quests for others to play through including the option for one player to take the role of the dungeon master while others attempted to make their way through their campaign even now tools like these are uncommon and when they are included are often unwieldy for most people to utilize very well neverwinter nightsdidnt do it perfectly by any means but it certainly pushed itself to give

the best ultrawide gaming monitorsto be fair concluding a trilogy as ambitious asmass effect is nearly an impossible task all the promises story threads player choices characters and so much more were expected to have satisfying conclusions but also ones tailored to each individual player who made choices and formed relationships through two previous games ifmass effect give everyone the exact ending they thought they deserved that wouldnt put it this far down on the list the fact that essentially no one felt they got an ending that represented or reflected a series built on player choice knocks it down to the number spotmass effect a game isnt bad at all sure theres the sort of dissonance of running around doing side quests and hanging out at bars while the reapers are presently wiping out all living things on several planets including earth but if you can look past some of the more gamey aspects it is a very tense and engaging setup for your final mission with shepard and
