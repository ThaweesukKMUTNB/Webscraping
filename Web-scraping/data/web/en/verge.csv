theverge,2022/05/04,https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23043011/snapchat-pixy-drone-hands-on,Snapchat’s flying camera,more than five years after it released spectacles snap is back with a second hardware product and this time it fliesyes snap made a drone called pixy the small yellow puck takes off from your hand follows you around and captures video that can be sent back to snapchat its snaps attempt at making a drone thats friendlier and more approachable than other products on the market and it may hint at the more advanced arpowered future snap is building towardpixy is available online for in the us and france starting thursday unlike most existing drones its small and light enough to fit in a pant pocket there isnt a controller it takes off from and lands on an outstretched palm and it uses six preprogrammed flight patterns that are accessible through a dial on the top of the devicewhy on earth would snap which primarily operates an ephemeral messaging app make a selfie drone its the first question i pose to ceo evan spiegelbecause were a camera company he tells me recently over video chat snap has brandished that tagline since when the company changed its name from snapchat to snap and released its first pair of spectacles our mission is to empower people to express themselves live in the moment learn about the world and have fun together and this product does exactly thatspiegel has been interested in drones for years dating back to at least when snap started tinkering with how the devices could fit into its camera company strategy he almost acquired a chinese drone company called zero zero robotics around then but the timing was off with facebook aggressively copying its staple stories feature investors were doubting snaps growth prospects as a newly public stock and the deal ultimately fell apart over price the company still isnt consistently profitable but snapchat is now growing much faster than facebook and already has more users than twitterso far drones havent caught on beyond professional use cases and early adopters most are heavy loud and expensive some even require a permit a key focus for pixy was making it approachable with friendlysounding propellers and a design that could fit into your pocket we finally got to a place where we were like wow this is super fun i guess we should probably release it says spiegelthe pixy weighs just grams with its swappable battery inserted snap says a full charge will get you five to eight flights which can range from roughly to seconds a short flight even by tiny drone standards additional batteries cost and snap sells a portable dualbattery charger for the pixys sensor shoots up to videos or photos all of which are stored locally on a drivethe footage is synced wirelessly to the memories section of snapchat edited there it doesnt capture audio so snap lets you use songs it has licensed from music labels and is then shareable directly in the app or elsewhere snap has included a few pixyspecific ar effects to choose from and id expect more to be added over time from the company and its creators an autocrop feature can quickly turn the horizontal footage into snaps staple vertical orientation centered on the main subject the video quality isnt amazing its not something youre going to want to display on a large screen but its fine enough for viewing on a phonethanks to a bottomfacing camera the pixys main trick is taking off and landing in your hand its frontfacing camera needs to be lined up roughly at eye level as it takes off and then it automatically tracks you as you move around when youre ready to end the flight simply outstretch your hand to the pixy and it returns to your palm during both outdoor and indoor tests i found this to be the most impressive part of using the drone it just works and induces a rare wow moment the first time it happensspiegel sees the pixy as a new way of capturing moments centered on people which is a more narrow view than how drones have been traditionally positioned i think pixy opens up a whole new space here because your smartphone cant fly he says you can get a totally new and different perspective and so in that way i think pixy is meaningfully better than what your smartphone can createthe pixy stands apart from competing small drones with its simplicity dji has for years been building small drones that can take off from your hand and automatically follow you around those drones feature longer battery life and higherquality video too but these competing models are also more expensive and much more complicated to use and theyre still much larger than the pocketable pixythere are some other limitations to the pixys design since the device is so light you won want to use it in windy conditions snap also advises against using it over water and other shiny reflective surfaces that could confuse its bottom camera that automates flyingsnap isnt planning to make a lot of money from the pixy the goal is really just to get it in peoples hands and have them play around with it according to spiegel and maybe we would make more with version two if people love the original product if anything snap may have set its own expectations for version one too low he says honestly in hindsight we probably should have made more and now its just difficult with all the supply chain stuff going on we just didnt expect it to be this goodback in before spectacles dropped i noticed that snap was advertising job openings with the tagline toys are preludes to serious ideasfirst coined by the famed design duo charles and ray eames that phrase has since proven to be emblematic of how snap operates what started as primarily a sexting app a decade ago now has more than million daily users including percent of year olds in over countries over million of those users engage with ar effects or lenses every day those lenses started by letting people vomit rainbows and wear dog ears now they can solve math equations and let you try on clothesspectacles have never been a commercial success and snap overestimated the demand for them initially but now they are fullfledged ar glasses that represent what many technologists including meta ceo mark zuckerberg believe will be the next major wave of computing despite having far less money than meta or apple snap is the first in its peer set with untethered functioning ar glasses and a burgeoning ecosystem of hundreds of developers making lenses for themspiegel sees snaps hardware efforts as a way to push the boundaries of what a camera can be he focuses on the camera because its how people are already expressing themselves on mobile phones when we look at our approach to hardware its really just about extending the core of what people are doing and love about snapchat he says one of the things that really changed our perspective on cameras was the handsfree nature of spectacles because people made totally different stuff a camera that flies naturally expands on that idearelatedif spectacles are any indication spiegel likely has multiple future generations of pixy up his sleeve he sees building hardware as a longterm commitment especially on the ar glasses side though he doesnt see those becoming mainstream for years its something we wanted to just steadily get better at over time because it is very

term and so i dont think that the prudent approach for us would be to try to push scale for a product that isnt ready yetultimately pixy may prove to be more of a hit in the near term than spectacles spiegel thinks after a couple versions of camera glasses it just becomes very clear that the market for camera glasses is actually very small and constrained to people who want that first person pov he says i think the market for pixy is biggergoing into our conversation i have a theory that like the first version of spectacles pixy is a trojan horse for a bigger idea drones are already being used to create maps which would be useful for building more realistic lenses that are grounded in the real world snap recently bought a french startup called nextmind that made a headband for controlling computers with your thoughts is a future coming in which im wearing ar spectacles and controlling a paired pixy with my mindwhen i ask spiegel about all this he chuckles indicating that is

blockbuster deals with joe rogan and the obamas and helped make the streamer a true force in podcasting when apple was the default would be leaving as wellmignano has left a different kind of mark on the company after cofounding diy podcast platform anchor with nir zicherman in mignano sold the app to spotify for million in and came aboard to lead the tech on podcasts video and everything not having to do with music video podcasts which launched in and expanded to additional creators this year fall in his purview in he oversaw the companys expansion into live audio when it bought locker room last year which has since been rebranded spotify livebut mignanos original app has proven to be his most consequential contribution to spotify bulking up the services library to million podcasts up from million podcasts in the company recently disclosed that percent of its new podcasts are uploaded through anchorits not that anchor has created any joe rogan or alex cooperesque stars for spotify it hasnt but the largely unmoderated volume of content it produces has helped shift the companys perspective on itself that it is a platform for creators not a publisher its the argument the

pickup truck is the oldest vehicle ive ever driven and also perhaps the newest thats because despite its vintage exterior everything inside from the drivetrain to the dash is less than one year old oh and its fully electricturns out what im really driving is a ford mustang mache gt performance edition but you couldnt tell from its gloriously restored truck shell from the outside its a beautifully done restomod with fresh gray and copper accents an custom badge and slick retro wheelsford performance the automakers motorsports division designed and commissioned the eluminator and was built by mle racecars in washington and like many of ford performances other oneoff projects this wont be available for purchase it exists solely as an auto show car that displays what could be built using fords electric crate motor which makes it easier to convert any old gasguzzler into an electric carthats great news for enthusiasts that want to renew classic cars without the carbon emissions they would otherwise produce as well as the small companies that specialize in these kinds of custom jobs zelectric motors built an electric porsche using donor tesla motors and luxury converters like everrati get their motors custommade but now with electric crate motors becoming available from big automakers like ford its a hopeful display of support for smaller shops and tinkerers that would like to modify their own vehiclesour own becca farsace made a whole video about how this is also a big statement for the right to repair movement she talked to chris salvo ceo of electrified garage and kyle wiens of ifixit on the matter check it outmany companies like tesla have historically made it difficult for small shops and skilled owners to fix their own electric cars by locking down the software and not making parts easily available but that hasnt stopped tinkerers like rich rebuilds on youtube from repairing the cars himself another youtuber simone giertz modded her model into a truck despite the companys record of blocking cars out of superchargingfords approach seems to be friendlier for the repair crowd its crate motor being sold is the same as the one in the mache already its been really really fun to see whos excited and wants something like this said ford performance marketing specialist autumn schwalbethe ecrate motors on offer from ford had run out of stock quickly but theyre back in production and readily available to buy ford could make the efforts seem even sweeter if it offered more parts that would make building a custom ev easier like batteries and a full drivetrain were in the works of creating some more parts to go along with the motor but nothing has been revealed yet schwalbe saidfusing the and the mache together was no easy task it involved tuning the truck for performance and adjusting the suspension to favor paved roads it has two motors making the eluminator capable of horsepower and lbft of torque and the truck bed is freshly coated for hauling theres no tow package installed though because this electric pickup truck isnt about that labor life fords got that side covered with its actual workhorse lightning electric trucksyou get all of the maches features like the touch screen with apple carplay digital dashboard gear shift dial wireless phone charger and modern seating but you wont forget that youre inside a vintage truck its got the original flappydoor glove compartment and youll need to crank the windows to open and close themit stinks that you cant buy the eluminator just like you cant buy hyundais gangster heritage series grandeur ev based on a design from the but ford at least let us drive this one we were amazed at how thrillingly quick it goes the truck certainly caught the attention of passersby too who were astounded by its showstopping presence as we whipped it around the city people started asking questions about its age and price which is when we broke it to them its fully electric toothe questions that followed were all too familiar to me so theres no gas at all how long does it take to charge how far does it go its almost as if it doesnt matter that this is a vintage oneoff restomod truck what really matters is whats on the inside its an electric car and people are still in the early stages of understanding themwe need more of these projects we need to maximize the usable life of every vehicle thats manufactured the entire process to make new cars from material mining to manufacturing is an emissionheavy process whether theyre electric or not research has shown that the entire lifespan of a new ev is still cleaner for the environment than that of a combustion engine vehicle even if the ev were exclusively charged on a dirty gridthe solution to clean travel is better public transport but the next best thing is electrification of cars and the best way to do that is to reuse old ones and turn them into ev restomods our own transportation editor andrew hawkins wrote about how manufacturers need to shut up and ship evs and it seems to be the case that will be the year to ship them and if automakers still dont ship the cars at least they can ship more of these parts then we can go build the evs ourselves and pray they do nothing to stop us,en,458,Positive

eluminator pickup truck is the oldest vehicle ive ever driven and also perhaps the newest thats because despite its vintage exterior everything inside from the drivetrain to the dash is less than one year old oh and its fully electricturns out what im really driving is a ford mustang mache gt performance edition but you couldnt tell from its gloriously restored truck shell from the outside its a beautifully done restomod with fresh gray and copper accents an custom badge and slick retro wheelsford performance the automakers motorsports division designed and commissioned the eluminator and was built by mle racecars in washington and like many of ford performances other oneoff projects this wont be available for purchase it exists solely as an auto show car that displays what could be built using fords electric crate motor which makes it easier to convert any old gasguzzler into an electric carthats great news for enthusiasts that want to renew classic cars without the carbon emissions they would otherwise produce as well as the small companies that specialize in these kinds of custom jobs zelectric motors built an electric porsche using donor tesla motors and luxury converters like everrati get their motors custommade but now with electric crate motors becoming available from big automakers like ford its a hopeful display of support for smaller shops and tinkerers that would like to modify their own vehiclesour own becca farsace made a whole video about how this is also a big statement for the right to repair movement she talked to chris salvo ceo of electrified garage and kyle wiens of ifixit on the matter check it outmany companies like tesla have historically made it difficult for small shops and skilled owners to fix their own electric cars by locking down the software and not making parts easily available but that hasnt stopped tinkerers like rich rebuilds on youtube from repairing the cars himself another youtuber simone giertz modded her model into a truck despite the companys record of blocking cars out of superchargingfords approach seems to be friendlier for the repair crowd its crate motor being sold is the same as the one in the mache already its been really really fun to see whos excited and wants something like this said ford performance marketing specialist autumn schwalbethe ecrate motors on offer from ford had run out of stock quickly but theyre back in production and readily available to buy ford could make the efforts seem even sweeter if it offered more parts that would make building a custom ev easier like batteries and a full drivetrain were in the works of creating some more parts to go along with the motor but nothing has been revealed yet schwalbe saidfusing the and the mache together was no easy task it involved tuning the truck for performance and adjusting the suspension to favor paved roads it has two motors making the eluminator capable of horsepower and lbft of torque and the truck bed is freshly coated for hauling theres no tow package installed though because this electric pickup truck isnt about that labor life fords got that side covered with its actual workhorse lightning electric trucksyou get all of the maches features like the touch screen with apple carplay digital dashboard gear shift dial wireless phone charger and modern seating but you wont forget that youre inside a vintage truck its got the original flappydoor glove compartment and youll need to crank the windows to open and close themit stinks that you cant buy the eluminator just like you cant buy hyundais gangster heritage series grandeur ev based on a design from the but ford at least let us drive this one we were amazed at how thrillingly quick it goes the truck certainly caught the attention of passersby too who were astounded by its showstopping presence as we whipped it around the city people started asking questions about its age and price which is when we broke it to them its fully electric toothe questions that followed were all too familiar to me so theres no gas at all how long does it take to charge how far does it go its almost as if it doesnt matter that this is a vintage oneoff restomod truck what really matters is whats on the inside its an electric car and people are still in the early stages of understanding themwe need more of these projects we need to maximize the usable life of every vehicle thats manufactured the entire process to make new cars from material mining to manufacturing is an emissionheavy process whether theyre electric or not research has shown that the entire lifespan of a new ev is still cleaner for the environment than that of a combustion engine vehicle even if the ev were exclusively charged on a dirty gridthe solution to clean travel is better public transport but the next best thing is electrification of cars and the best way to do that is to reuse old ones and turn them into ev restomods our own transportation editor andrew hawkins wrote about how manufacturers need to shut up and ship evs and it seems to be the case that will be the year to ship them and if automakers still dont ship the cars at least they can ship more of these parts then we can go build the evs ourselves and pray they do nothing to stop us,en,458,Positive
