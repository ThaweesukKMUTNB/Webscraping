finding something edible to get through the day you pick up some rotten sushi and think this might just be the thing but then it turns out that you actually have to use it to trap a rat in a bottle then swipe a bus card to ride into town and get yourself a proper mealthis is one of the earliest puzzles in encodya and that alone paints a pretty accurate picture of what life is like for tina and the future isn looking too good in this dystopian adventure but is it worth spending hours of your life on to see where it goestable of contentsthe story of encodyain this bleak cyberpunk world set way in the future players follow the tale of tina a nineyearold orphan living on the streets and her loyal robot encodya landscape is filled with complicated tech and vehicles zooming through the air but it also home to underpaid professors hiding in back alleys and vr junkies trapped in digital worlds just to be anywhere but herethe muck and grime underneath the massive city is where nononsense tina thrives as a scavenger and protects her while trying to hold on to his lovable botesque innocence at the same timethere are whispers of political strife everywhere but all tina really cares about is scraping by just enough to sleep at night and wake up the next day the plot thickens of course when your typical government megalomaniac starts chasing after the protagonists because of a valuable code inside designed by tina missing father to be unlocked when she hits the tender age of ten the code sets them off on a wild adventure with lots of quirky encounters along the way and one of the saddest endings everencodya gameplay and visualsthe main strength i feel of encodya is its absolutely stunning visuals characters are designed beautifully from random street cleaner bots to overbearing computer shop salesclerks the backgrounds of every new scene are jawdropping with such attention to detail that it easy to just marvel at the scenery in front of you and forget about the actual game i also love how random passersby pop up here and there every so often adding to the dynamic feel of every new scenecharacters are also fully voiced and there a wide range of accents and little idiosyncrasies for all the npcs i also particularly enjoyed how when you switch between and tina you can elicit different reactions and even launch a completely different set of dialogue lines from different people some puzzles require tina street smarts while some need robotic yet kinder touchthere are also plenty of hilarious and ultrameta references here along with easter eggs that pointandclick fans will no doubt chuckle at cut scenes are masterfully done as well talking to people can sometimes reveal solutions to problems that you wouldn expect so if you stuck in particular puzzle you might just need to be a little bit more persistent with the npcs you talk toyou can highlight items you can interact with but the effect is too subtle to really be of any use most of the time there also a handy list of things you need to accomplish in your todo list to assist you plus you can ask for hints in the easy mode to help you out in a pinch in that sense there a good mix of both logical and illogical puzzles here with item combinations leaning a bit more toward the frustrating side due to the awkward controlswhat the appealherein lies my biggest issue with the game which sadly overpowers the positive elements of the title for me the controls for the mobile version are extremely clunky and it a darn shame for a pointandclick game you really can point nor click here as you have to get close to an item physically to be able to interact with it while that might be okay on the pc i do find it odd that for a mobile version that should prioritise touchscreen controls the touching wasn utilised well here at allin particular an intuitive pointandclick game on mobile would have allowed the user to simply tap on an object they wish to interact with something that was superbly done with kathy rain director cut of course i no dev so i have no idea how easy or difficult this may be to do but if you could actually point and clickslashtap on something in a pointandclick game then that would made everything much less frustratingthe movement here isn any better as tina tends to slog and speed up towards areas you drag her towards in a finicky way obviously as with anything you can get used to controls no matter how difficult they may be but how long will it take players to get the hang of them if at all before they give up and dnf the gameencodya is a bit of a mixed bag for me as its story has a lot of heart and its visuals are topnotch but the controls kind of put a damper on the whole experience i understand how this would be much more enjoyable on pc perhaps but sadly i feel like there a missed opportunity to really create a mobileoptimised version here,en,432,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony-anniversary-edition/mobile-review/,"Danganronpa V3: Killing Harmony mobile review - ""A long and winding road""",blood gore and death are alltoonormal in this narrativedriven murder mystery game but thanks to its stylised visuals stomaching gruesome killings doesn seem so bad in danganronpa killing harmony players are tasked with murdering one another in a twisted killing game and then figuring out who the culprit is in a trial the concept is pretty similar to past titles in the series but is this instalment worth a go for both fans and nonfans alikedanganronpa killing harmony story and visualsas the game starts players wake up with no recollection of how they got to where they are only that they supposed to be enrolled in this odd little academy where you have to kill to succeed a group of very distinct characters pool together to try and escape the murderous school guided only by an odd animatronic bear called monokuma and his equally odd children called the monokubsthe goal of the socalled killing game is seemingly simple someone has to be murdered to progress and if the murderer is outed then that culprit is executed in a horrific display of gore and irony sure the blood is pink but each death still paints a pretty vivid image that will force its way into your brain and settle there nice and snugin stark contrast to the theme of the title the visuals feature stylised artwork and gorgeous comicbookesque character designs with movements that almost simulate a popup storybook the lovely music in the background also contradicts the dark tones of the game which does a brilliant job of lulling you to a false sense of security throughout the narrativedanganronpa killing harmony controlsfor the mobile release i paid particular attention to how the controls were ported onto my ios device while the pointandclick aspect of the game feels very intuitive as you simply have to tap at items to interact with them things do get a little complicated when you need to tap certain objects that are far too close to each other in one particular instance i had to tap at my door to exit the room but since there was a character standing in front of the door i kept accidentally tapping at him instead of where i actually wanted to goanother issue i encountered was when i was trying to navigate a platforming minigame using the virtual dpad on the left side of my screen and a jump button on the right side somehow the controls just wouldn cooperate with me as trying to leap through ravines seemed almost impossible given the wonky onscreen controls granted this particular minigame is apparently designed to be extremely difficult but i just not sure whether or not the controls are unresponsive on purposethe mobile autosave function on the other hand does come in handy during unexpected mistakes however logging off at any given point in time doesn actually bring you back exactly where you left off upon logging back in you can create manual saves if you wish but it really not something i often think about before logging out of a mobile gamei did appreciate how you can fasttravel to various waypoints on the map as the school is pretty expansive you can always travel to where you want to go when there are specific instances you need to walk through but it a handy feature that saves you a lot of time and grief especially when you feel like you onto something and you don want to break your momentumwhat the appealdanganronpa killing harmony has been out for a while now on other platforms so many players will likely already be familiar with its concept and twisted narrative i wasn able to play the previous titles in the series but i didn feel like i needed to while playing this game characters feel fresh and unique and the gameplay while eccentric does grow on you with each new chapterwhat i didn particularly enjoy was how long and dragging each scene was the dialogue feels awkward and a little overthetop but it would have been more tolerable if i didn have to linger too long on these lines of tacky conversation and unnecessary scenesthe murder mysteries themselves are absolutely genius there are red herrings everywhere and the plotwriting is simply brilliant you not going to get by simply by skipping scenes or autoing your way through the text here you really have to put on your thinking cap to figure out who telling the truth using truth bullets which is pretty awesomeit just a shame that it takes too darn long to get there and the class trials held at the end of each chapter to determine the culprit take forever too it doesn help that there a repetitive loop here as each murder is performed the game also tries to offer these social commentaries every now and then which feels a little on the nose at timesthankfully there are plenty of pop culture references that help break up the monotony plus murders are so disturbing and the executions even more so you can roam around and build bonds with other characters during free time as well as explore the campus if you feel like taking a break from all the killing and when you do get to the conclusion of each case the payoff is pretty good it just feels like it takes too long to get thereby the way make sure that your device has enough free space for the extra data download as it a pretty expansive game,en,430,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/just-cause-mobile/first-impressions/,Just Cause Mobile impressions preview - Skydiving into Kaboom-boom central,as a longtime fan of games centered around military ops the recent announcement of regional access for the upcoming just cause mobile from square enix saw me on cloud ninethe abcs of just cause background and lorebefore we get into it for those who dont know just cause is a relatively young franchise developed by swedish video game company avalanche studios group and published by eidos interactive subsequently square enix that first debuted on pc in and now has four installments the franchise brands itself as an actionadventure in the original series and obligatory spoiler alert you play rico rodriguez an unfortunate orphan turned cia officer on a journey of vengeance to combat bloodthirsty dictators however in the mobile game the timeline is set after the events of the pc gamesinto the capital d for destruction and damnationupon booting up the game i was greeted with a stunning cinematic trailer with a cool zoom in on the proud square enix logo through an eye lens and some cool hollywood action however the glamour immediately shattered as a messy introduction screen soon followed as if the game glitched halfway and forced the player out into the main menu talk about a rough transitioncharacter customizationbefore the tutorial section you will be introduced to the character customization menu where you get to fiddle around with multiple options to create a character that best suits your style however the degree of customizability is scarce as you are only given eight hair options to choose from to start off my journey i went with the one that looked like a gigachadgameplay and combat mechanics of just cause mobilethe gameplay is where things deviate from the main series instead of the usual thirdperson perspective your character is controlled from a topdown angle similar to moba games as with all just cause games you will use guns or rpg launchers in combat more on that later you will also explore a vast openworld by running around like a maniac and shooting at enemies however one particular mechanic i would like to highlight is the grapplerslash wingsuitslashparachute movementalso readthis is where you can pull off some crazy stunts to get around and it admittedly takes time to master the learning curve is definitely there these actions can be combined together for instance you can spin your grappling hook like spidermans web blaster aim it in a direction and follow up with a tap on the parachute button and voila you are up in the air to balance things out your flight time is limited by a stamina bar and youll hit the ground once it is depleted you can also tap and hold the parachute button to ascend into the skies and glide around by switching to the wingsuityou level up by completing campaign quests from npcs you encounter while navigating through the world one of the trademarks carried over from the main series in the fictional island nation renowned for its slums and rundown buildings you will also travel across the land bustling with many other firebrand players but walking is not the only mode of transportation here as you get to ride in multiple vehicles scattered around the map speed down the road in style and perhaps go on a road rage and run over some poor folks or take to the sky with a chopper one thing is for sure it offers players the choice of either gaining air or ground superiority with that said at most ive only been able to find an armoured vehicle and a transport truck to drive aroundin triple threat you are acquainted with nine of your teammates and are pitted against two other teams on a sprawling landscape the condition for victory is simple gain the most points within a set time limit you have a few options from capturing enemy bases repelling the enemys attacks and conquering the fourth base for extra points however youd be better off clearing the campaign missions since the matchmaking currently takes ages last but not least there are also two other modes challenge and battle zone modes both of which require playing through the story to unlockdynamic storylinewhen it comes to the storyline it kept to the usual formulaic storyline seen in its pc counterparts except that the timeline has been fastforwarded and takes place in the future after the events of just cause you play as a firebrand recruit with the task of ousting the local big bad darkwater contingent and the entire series of campaign missions see you helping out locals and sabotaging whatever devilish plots darkwater is up to itd make the terminator franchise proudeach story cutscene plays out like a visual novel youre presented with static images as someone who has played too many visual novels i dont have anything against this style of storytelling but itd be nice to see some cinematic animated cutscenes play out to add more flavouruser interface and realistic graphicswhile i would say the game nailed it with simple practical design it does not have anything inspiring to write home abouton the aesthetics front it definitely delivered square enix pulled no punches in expressing the grittiness found in the world of the mainline games and that made it a standout aspect they really put attention to detail in making the environment as lively and realistic as possible npcs are scattered throughout and they are the primary source of quests another cool feature is that they will react to your shooting so you can become an antagonist of sorts and scare the civilians and watch them cower in fearthe bread and butter of every good action game simple controlsas for the controls thankfully its laid out in a simplified manner you move around with a virtual joystick on the left side of the screen while on the right youll find all the essential action buttons the trigger button is also located on the right of the screen you drag the rocker to aim and hold it down to fire the fact that each weapons accuracy varies is a neat touch and the military humvees bullets always miss the mark i see it as a great opportunity to train the reflex and coordination of your right thumbsthe rpg mechanics inventory managementthis is where just cause mobile set itself apart from the main series by heavily emphasizing gear on the topmost layer is the weapon category where you get to choose two weapons to bring around to terrorize the innocentsuhh i mean deliver justice to darkwater the options presented are vastareas of improvementthe camera angle needs a lot of work its all over the place and can be very disorientating you need to constantly rotate it to gain a better view of where your mission objectives are or locate your foes sometimes the view will be obstructed by large buildings in the background another elephant in the room to address is the spawn rate of enemy npcs and vehicles theyre like mushrooms after a drizzle they bloom almost every minute and this makes the whole environment too busy it never ceases to baffle me when the enemy npc mob respawn almost immediately after killing them a few seconds ago i was also wondering if this was the source of my frame lag at busier momentsthe character animations felt incredibly clunky too and are susceptible to glitching out this could not be more egregious when i am driving my vehicle around to ram the enemy npcs which will clip through vehicles while others act unfazed as you push them aroundthe main character also suffers when transitioning from parachuting to glidingone minor nitpick will be directed towards the performance generally everything runs smoothly for my phone except in heated combat outside of that there only the occasional stutter and some issues with graphics not loading incorrectlyfinal thoughtstheres a fair bit of polishing to be done before release but for a regional early access offering its presentable the spawn rate animations and camera angle are the biggest offenders other than that i am looking forward to the official release one thing for certain it will delight fans of this franchise to no end if we get to see ragdoll physics fully rolled out in this version of the game,en,648,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/taito-egret-ii-mini/review-limited-edition-arcade-nostalgia/,"Taito Egret II Mini review - ""Limited-edition arcade nostalgia for your home""",my childhood gaming experience can be defined by many things but these three will always stand out poor eyesight my patient older brother and dying on a pixelated screen over and over again part of the appeal of retro games is the difficulty the lack of save states and handholding included but the one thing that keeps us coming back for more is the nostalgia of it allthe desire to revisit that sweet innocence of youth is what compels us to put ourselves through torture just to get a taste of that oldschool exhilaration a whiff of the good old days when life and games were simpler the taito egret ii mini aims to recapture all that in a tiny portable package but is that sentiment really worth the purchasetaito egret ii mini design and hardwarethe taito egret ii mini fits an entire arcade cabinet on the top of your desk or even on the palm of your hand albeit not the most convenient it lightweight portable and packs the right kind of chunkiness that makes it look absolutely adorable no matter where you choose to display it it sleek without losing its retro feel and you can enhance its aesthetics with funky stickers and a doityourself ledlit marquee it a little odd that the unit doesn come with any of the taito titles posters for you to slide into the acrylic on top but i suppose a little diy gives the egret mini a more personal onthego feelthe miniaturised home console features a joystick you can set to four or eight directions as well as your typical abcdef buttons there a handy option for you to add as many credits as you can to a game eliminating the need for actual tokens you have to pour blood sweat and tears for at the arcade upon booting up the console which can be powered up with a simple usbc cable you get the full lineup of taito titles with a nifty preview of the game on your screen you can also customise settings on the menu such as screen ratio volume difficulty and the likeof course the main highlight of the egret mini is that you can rotate the actual screen to fit the game you playing best a simple snap and click can give you a landscape or portrait orientation and the mechanism really does feel robust you won have to worry about breaking the thing just because you went a little too triggerhappy with the rotation the screen also locks nicely once you pop it back into the console so there a satisfying tactical response each time you set your screen orientationtaito egret ii mini gaming experienceobviously the very first thing i tried was bubble bobble and the very first thing that happened was my expected demise everything from the music to the sound effects brought me back to warm weekend afternoons with my brother hunched over our family computer console trying desperately to get our little cartoon dragons safe enough to rescue the love of their lives as bub and bob raged against the perils of the cave of monsters on my screen i found myself travelling back in time as the realities of my current world simply faded awaythat in itself makes each game from the taito egret ii mini lineup a joy to have a go at whether it shooting pixelated aliens in space invaders or getting rid of unwitting bad guys popping out of identical apartments in elevator action this time you can create save files to make your life easier or add unlimited credits to make sure you don perish and lose all of your progress midgamethere are games available in the basic review unit i received which is the limited blue edition but you can supposedly add ten more titles via the sd card you can slide into the console side slot from the expanded bundles you can also plug in two additional controllers via usb sold separatelywhat the appealplaying retro games on the taito egret ii mini feels very satisfying in that it stays true to the og titles in every aspect of course with such a small screen and limited real estate when it comes to the buttons you can spend hours on the console like you would with others mainly because squinting at the tiny screen will likely give you a headache for me at leastthankfully there an hdmi cable included in the package making each pixelated game you play even more largerthanlife you still have to use the egret ii mini gamepad though but the huge screen is a great modernisation of the classics on your consolei also felt like my hands were a little too close to each other as i was playing but it didn bother me too much being a petite woman of asian descent it did however feel too cramped for my husband so if you want to play games on a more comfortable level you might need to shell out a few extra bucks for those two controllers instead most of the games in the roster are best enjoyed with two players anyway so having a go at the egret mini all by your lonesome likely isn very ideal for the record my dualshock controller and my hori gamepad didn workwhile the package comes with its own usbc cable you still have to plug it in yourself and oddly enough plugging it into some power adapters didn work i had to test out a few of them to find which ones did it would been more convenient if the package came with its own adapter at the very leastas for the buttons they do feel sturdy but there still that innate fear of breaking the thing when you buttonmashing like crazy which you tend to do quite often some of the text in certain games are in japanese as well but then again i suppose you don need to read the text to get into the game the selection of titles also isn the most comprehensive i guessing plenty of smartypants players out there will eventually find a way to sneak their homebrew games in there somehowoverall the taito egret ii mini is an absolute joy to have in your home but only if you a collector and a huge fan of retro games there are after all only units to be sold worldwide so it a true collector gemthe hefty price tag is something you have to weigh though do you feel like it worth having a time capsule like this in your living room for that occasional burst of nostalgia ultimately it up to you and your priorities but apart from all of the features i talked about here my fondest experiences of playing the egret mini were when i could practically feel my younger self squealing and wailing at the screen with my brother at my side as a kid all over again and honestly that feeling is pretty priceless,en,501,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/loopy-wizard/app-army-assemble/,"App Army Assemble: Loopy Wizard - ""Is this roguelike puzzler magic?""",loopy wizard is the latest effort from indie developer jesse vebrux it uses the same concept as his previous game seven scrolls but aims to be slightly more accessible than its predecessor our app army thoroughly enjoyed verbux last outing so we decided to hand loopy wizard over to them and find out what they thoughthere what they saidoksana ryanthis is a fun timewaster which involves killing enemies with spells while trying to escape to the next level the graphics are bright and cheerful the gameplay easy to pick up with the help of an easy to follow tutorial but the sound effects werent to my liking and i turned them off there are various spells to win when you kill enemies and some enemies give you a life heart when theyre dispatched allowing you the opportunity to carry on playing theres really not a lot more to say except it is fun to play and i found myself picking it up when i had a few minutes to spare but didnt want to dive into anything too immersiverobert mainesloopy wizard is a turned based dungeon crawl that can be frustrating at times the playing area is a square that is subdivided into smaller squares and you must guide your wizard one turn at a time to reach the exit random monsters and walls complicate your route above the playing area is a clock where spells you pick up from defeated monsters go as each turn is completed the hand of the clock moves allowing you to access the spell the hand points atgames tend to be over quickly monsters regenerate so its best to reach the exit quickly also if you kill all the monsters in the playing area and the clock hand points at a damaging spell you have used it on your wizard this can be very frustrating especially when your wizard is low on health graphically simple the game is addictive and has that one more go vibe as you try to improve your score i can see myself playing this game for a long timemax williamsas a rule i can be bothered with scorechasing games eg roguelikes where you lose all your progress and start again when things go wrong however the highly original to my knowledge core mechanic in loopy wizard is so compelling that it keeps me coming back for another attemptyou have a of spells at the top of the screen and the clock hand goes around each turn if you can cast the spell it pointing at you have to even if that means casting it on yourself so that instantkill spell which seemed so cool when you first picked it up when it time for that spell if there are no enemies then you pointing that gun at your own head and pulling the triggeri learned that often the best spells are ones which neutralise the enemy rather than kill them and cloning yourself is very useful too since your clone can take the heat if necessary but just the order in which spells appear on the clock can make a big difference it an emergentgameplay sort of a game built from simple ingredients but with unpredictable consequencesso i unusually hooked but will probably tire of it in a day or two after a particularly long run it will just be too painful to start again if it had any kind of xpbased permanent progression a roguelite rather than a roguelike then i would probably get fullon addicted and not play anything else for the next few weeks in either case it a very original game with a very compelling core mechanicpierpaolo morgantei played the game a lot because the artwork is super cute and the music is catchy lw is turnbased and your goal is to guide the wizard to the next level of the dungeon while dodging or attacking the monsters that populate each level on your way down you can pick up spells that you can use to your advantage or hearts to refill your life points the game is challenging especially at the lower levels but i never found it frustrating i also saw a lot of replayability in a nutshell this game is a gem it is totally worth itmichael purdythis game is best described as a roguelike puzzle game you move a wizard on a grid with several monsters moving to attack you if you see them you attack automatically as will they if they see you it works like a sliding game moving from square to square trying to get to the stairs to the next floor it is a lot harder than it sounds this game is fun and infuriatingmark abukoffjust like seven scrolls this is great fun simple to pick up fast five or less minute bites of dungeon crawling and fighting andor dodging various monsters the artanimation is cute the music is cute the spells are imaginative and useful i do recommend that you check out the help button to see what each one does its a fun cross between fighting it out youll lose eventually but rack up an impressive score and fighting your way to the exitthe controls work fine the only problem i had was remembering that this is turnbased what i found myself doing when i forgot that was hurrying through tactical decisions and messing up take it slow look at your options and spells and gather those up because they can help a great deal this game like seven scrolls accomplishes exactly what it set out to do a fun turnbased dungeon crawler that easy to pick up and play for a few minutes awesome game that i happily recommendwhat is the app armythe app army is

exploration rts that star discord takes inspiration from are in hot water right now that hasn stopped indie developer illogical games from doing its own thing with the popular ipa part love letter to starcraft and part a minecraftesque experience star discord attempts to take everything there is to love about the terrans and adapts it all onto mobile but while the effort is indeed valiant does it actually pay off in the endtable of contentsthe visuals of star discordthe indie oneman team of amarul natenan crafted this starcraft lookalike in hopes of creating that same realtime strategy feel but optimised for mobile while star discord definitely isn attempting to get the graphics of the blizzard title down pat it certainly is trying its best to keep the vibe pretty familiarfor one thing scvs have been renamed as fcws and buildings while charmingly lowpoly are still reminiscent of terran structures as a starcraft fan myself i do find that it all very welcome even if there are a few things that haven been renamed just yet the text requirements for building a war factory for instance tells you that you need to build a barracks first which is actually called a boot camp in the gamethe boxy visuals are also pretty adorable adding to the accessibility of the game as it adapted to a more casual rts experience on mobile the background music is topnotch as well and is enough to keep your adrenaline pumping when you laying waste to your enemy bases and victory is just within reachstar discord gameplaythe main campaign for star discord serves as a handson tutorial as you be introduced to each unit in small bitesized chunks maps and unit selection progressively get more complex as you go on as do your enemies capabilities once you feel like you gotten a hang of the game you can challenge other players in unranked pvp matches as wellads do pop up after every battle which is actually no big deal a match can last anywhere from five minutes to twenty minutes so having just one ad in between matches is very very generous of the developer and while there is only one race at the moment the dev has expressed plans to expand other races in the future which would be an absolute treatof course while the campaign teaches you about the units structures and overall mechanics of the game it doesn help very much when it comes to mastering the game controls you pretty much have to tinker around with them yourself save for random tips that pop up at the beginning of each mission you can also have a look at the actual textbased tutorial but it a tad difficult to memorise all those commands right before you start a battlestar discord controlsthis brings us to the main issue with the game the controls this as expected is where most of the difficulty lies as the game has taken on this massive endeavour of porting a huge rts onto a mobile device i myself played this game on my teninch tablet but i still get the dreaded fatfinger slipups every now and then i can only imagine how it must be like to play this on an actual phone with a smaller screenthankfully you can adjust the size of the ui in the game settings so that the buttons aren all over the place but then it becomes a matter of squinting to see the text you just thoroughly reduced in particular the minimap is the biggest bother for me as it blocks a huge chunk of your screen on the upper left and can really hinder you from micromanaging units or even just scrolling towards that areaspeaking of scrolling you can also adjust how you want to navigate your map i wish there was a tip that you can actually do this because it took me many painful missions before i found out you could adjust this in the settings you can choose to scroll through your map like you would with a mouse or you can invert it and do something more intuitive with your touchscreen in that you can drag the screen to view certain parts of your map i got mine set on the latter because it a touchscreen and my instincts immediately want to drag rather than scroll but it all up to your preferred stylethat said the biggest thing you need to train yourself to do here is to deselect deselect deselect coming off rts games on pc you simply click from one unit or structure to the next without really giving it much thought here you need to deselect any existing selection or you might just end up sending an fcw you just commanded to build a supply silo right into enemy territory it just a matter of getting used to this new mechanic eventuallywhat the appealbut perhaps the biggest issue i encountered here is that the ai of the units isn all that smart at least not yet when you command a group of units to move to a certain location they do exactly that and only that they won care if an enemy unit attacks them along the way they blindly move to that spot you commanded them to and will likely die in the processnow if you thinking you can just micro them to counterattack it also not as easy as that for instance basic ranger units tend to be on the smaller side so when you tap on an enemy ranger to counterattack you might not always tap that exact enemy unit the first time or worse you might accidentally tap on the ground next to that enemy unit causing your whole army to move to that spot rather than counterattack this has happened to me more times than i like and it can be very frustratinga fix would probably be to make attacking a priority for troops as opposed to moving but as i no dev i not sure how easy or difficult that might be it would also probably help if things were more automated since this is a mobile game and can have the same luxuries as a pc gamefor instance perhaps setting units to autoattack or fcws to autospawn would already make the game easier to navigate while the control groups function and the building planner are quite welcome perhaps it might also be a good idea to set an autoexpand or autoupgrade function for structures and units just to lessen the micromanaging in a mobile gameoverall star discord needs a bit more polish but it an impressive effort especially for a oneman studio perhaps there a reason why starcraft was never ported to mobile due to the clunky controls but this game does try its best to find a solution to all that and i very very glad it did,en,482,Positive

pesky looters so they won be able to steal as much goldpets are your best friends and for good reasononce you unlock pets after you unlock the village you can hatch some pets that give you extra bonuses foxy helps you in raids tiger gives you rewards when attacking and rhino is great for blocking attacks although you can only have one pet active at all times you can swap it out for another whenever you likemake sure you feed your pets to keep them strong and active and during the timelimited events that take place once in a while in coin master you try to get pet food or simply spend a couple of bucks for it in the shop just make sure you always choose the best pet depending on what you want to do and try to boost it as much as you can i personally prefer foxy but if you are a ratheraggressive player who likes to raid tiger might be a better choice for yougot too much gold buy some chestswe know all of these free coins will start to pile up sooner or later the best use invest in some chestsin the shop you will find the usual items that go for reallife money but you can also find types of chests wooden gold and magical that you can purchase by using your ingame gold

good rewards but it might be quite difficult to complete each and every one of them some card sets have limited cards so they will be a little bit hard to getthe best would be to spend your gold on

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/puzzle-quest-3/review/,"Puzzle Quest 3 review - ""Engaging combat, but not the most free-to-play friendly""",what is it about games that really gets our gears going is it the splashy animation sequence that congratulates you on a successful match or simply the satisfaction of linking colours together much like the toddler toys of our youth there definitely an itch there that yearning to be scratched and infinity plus two with games found that secret sauce first with the puzzle quest franchisein puzzle quest players can dive back into the trailblazing ip with a brand new quest to save the world but is the third instalment of the beloved franchise worth coming back tothe story of puzzle quest expected of any oldschool rpg you start off as a regular character that thrust into a quest to save the world of etheria of course it wouldn be an rpg without those random encounters along the way which range from pesky goblin nuisances to the occasional npc that needs help with a few chorescharacters you meet along the way may just join your cause as followers who can grant you special boons in and out of combat the very first one you meet eveline can create and exchange relics for you which are useful upgrade materials you need to buff your gear you also get to recruit minions that can help you unlock special chests or provide support during pvp combatpuzzle quest gameplay and visualsthis lovely combination of and rpg gameplay elements is what made the puzzle quest franchise popular and this time visuals are in full you pick your class paladin berserker shaman assassin or necromancer and engage in puzzle battles with monsters in the field where you can not only match colours skulls and gems vertically and horizontally but also diagonallywhat makes this new instalment even more unique is the fact that there a timer that starts once you start matching your first gem and you can match as many tiles as you want to until the timer runs out it best then to calculate your plan of attack beforehand to execute it in one blow once the timer starts adding a new layer of strategy to the gameplayyou are however manipulating your board all by your lonesome your enemy doesn have the same luxury this means that a tile you may have overlooked will still be there during your next turn each character class also has unique spells that correspond to colours on the board so you can pick the one which suits your playstyle best you can still create new characters in limited slots so don worry if you can make up your mind right awaywhile the elements may seem straightforward the rpg elements are anything but outside of combat you pick up gear from loot upgrade them salvage the ones you don need and evolve your weapons and equipment to the highest rarity for more devastating damage you can do the same for your spells as you can switch up your loadouts to equip the abilities you think will save you in a pinch in the world tab you can also take part in limitedtime boss battles participate in raid dungeons for materials and take on daily challenges for more valuable lootwhat the appealwhile all of these are typical elements of mobile rpgs nowadays the content feels a little too restrictive due to the timers on practically everything for instance opening chests require specific keys and if you don have them you can send your minions to do the work for you which will take hours before the chest can be opened you can also pay your way through gems to speed things up this instantpay feature is also present in followers tasks plus in unlocking slotsin particular you only have limited slots for storing chests and whatnot so if you want more you have to pay up upgrade materials are also a little difficult to come by if you don grind in the dungeons enough plus there a difference between paid currencies and being an actual vip there are just some things your paid currencies can buy if you not in the vip clubwith the many many many materials you need to upgrade gear it can be a challenge to progress if you looking for a more casual experience it not all about your prowess here winning matches means being able to maximize all the gear you got and you can do that if you don pay attention to each detail of each game content it can be pretty overwhelming at times the game definitely isn made to simply feed your hunger as a pickupandgo titlethe pvp element is also a little underwhelming at the moment as you matched with a random player that you can switch out it simply a matter of which player has the higher combat power most of the time which doesn really leave too much room for strategic thinkingstill puzzle quest is an enjoyable experience and it not something you can simply breeze through i myself have been playing the game for a little under two weeks now and i still feel like i barely scratched the surface it meant to be a live game after all with plenty of other robust updates to come as the developers finetune the title in the future,en,384,Positive

anyone who ever wanted to play with figurines and marvel at their collection on a customised shelf i myself am already guilty of this irl but as i sure any collector would agree with the budget and shelf space is limited while we all wish we had unlimited resources to complete our collections it just not feasible in real life especially when you adulting is itthankfully figure fantasy knows your deepest hurts and pains and wants to help you with your fantasy and no it doesn have to cost an arm and a legthe story of figure fantasyinterestingly enough figure fantasy does have an intriguing narrative that justifies why your toys are coming to life all of a sudden out of nowhere it not simply a toy storyesque affair here the characters in the game actually have a deeper motivation apart from just provoking the big fat cat we love you gingeryou play as the master of these figurines in your room and while it can feel a little odd to be talking to them don we all do that in real life sometimes and interacting with them the narrative does a good job at achieving suspension of disbelief i also really appreciate how you can skip a cut scene and still go back to them in your gallery just in case you missed something or you want to leisurely watch the story unfold when you got some spare timefigure fantasy graphicsthe visuals of figure fantasy are what differentiates this title from all other mobile gacha games out there each figure is so beautifully rendered with realistic lighting and textures that i really do feel like i playing with real figurines each time i log into the game characters are uniquely designed as well from their masterfully crafted positions to the gorgeous base plates that the higherstar ranking characters haveto be honest i often spend a good chunk of each gameplay session just rearranging stuff in my ingame shelves in the otaku zone decorating my room with fancy ornaments and finding the best spot for my favourite figurines they simply too pretty to ignore and if i could i love to put them all up for display you can only do so a limited number of times but your shelf capacity does increase as you level upas for during combat the graphics also do a marvelous job at bringing these figurines to life as each battle animation or special move executed looks absolutely gorgeous the character art itself even in mode looks stunning as it is add that to the variety of characters you can pull from the gacha pool and you really will want to collect them allfigure fantasy gameplaytypical of the genre you have your regular dungeons for material collection your pvp modes your endless tower and your rogueliteesque mode battles are your standard idle game affair where you can choose to toggle the auto button on or off you also receive idle rewards to help level up your characters as well as a way to match the level of all your characters with your top five figurinesskills you develop are reimagined in such a way that makes you feel like you really collecting toys from different brands and the gacha system reinforces that same aesthetic you have blind boxes delivered to you when you pull from the summons pool you can even sign up for a kind of collector membership vip card for premium members of courseyou can also hold up your figurines turn them around play with them and paint them all these things make what familiar and wellloved in gacha titles more interesting since the game adds a fresh twist to tired old elementswhat the appealit difficult to find something to complain about here i thoroughly enjoying figure fantasy beautiful roster of husbandos and waifus i just think it absolutely genius to paint everything you normally find in an idle gacha game in a whole new light by making everything figurinethemed even the skills that you upgrade are based on the toys descriptions and manufacturing histories for instance the elemental attributes you normally find in rpgs have been renamed as brands with affinities and synergies based on classesthe fact that you can take a photo of your lovely figurine collection in ar mode also blurs the lines between what real and what not a little bit and it really almost like you own these digital figurines in real life my photography skills need a lot of work but you get the ideaoverall figure fantasy takes your typical gacha game and puts a unique spin into it and it very very consistent even backdrops and sets are all done in miniature mode it doesn feel paytowin at all as ingame currencies are pretty generous you can definitely pull toptier characters as a player in my experience and it doesn feel grindy either if anything it a great way to quench your thirst for collecting figurines because who says digital and physical ownership have to be mutually exclusiveif you like the game as much as we did use some of ourfigure fantasy codesand get a good headstart but you should also take a look at thetier list and a detailed reroll

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/one-hand-clapping/review/,"One Hand Clapping review - ""Figuratively and literally breathtaking""",set in a fantastical world where being pitchperfect is a matter of life and death one hand clapping stands out from other cookiecutter platformers out there in that this time it not all about your leaping prowess knowing exactly how to calculate the distance you need to jump through the air isn going to save you when push comes to shove it all about your vocal chops here and no you don have to be a grammy winner to nail the perfect notebad dream games vocal platformer is laudable in its attempt to do something different with a tired ol genre but is that gimmick enough to truly make this title shinetable of contentsthe story of one hand clappingfrom the getgo the game thrusts you into a dark and gloomy place where everything is pitch black you have to find the strength within you to speak up and sing your song per se as the notes you sing will light the way for you the very first stage is mainly that you walk along some dreary ruins and illuminate your path by singing or rather humming at an acceptable volumesilent city as the first chapter is called doesn really require you to bust out that singing voice you only ever unleashed in the shower you mostly get by with just a few consistent hums you hold long enough to cross certain platforms sometimes staying quiet saves you from the creepy shadows lurking in the corner other times singing drives them away they after you for some reason and you need to do everything you can to escapenow i don say for some reason lightly here as there really is no explanation whatsoever as to where you are who you are and why there are black bloblike goo thingies with eyes following your every move this is one of my biggest problems with the game to be honest as i always connect with a game via its story first and foremostthe lack of a narrative here takes away from my engagement as i don even know what my motivation is or why i even trudging along countless other games can tell a story beautifully despite the lack of any words said and it a shame that one hand clapping couldn achieve the same thingone hand clapping gameplay and visualsobviously with such a unique gameplay mechanic i suppose i can forgive the fact that the narrative fell by the wayside here the highlight is really the unique voicecontrolled movement of the character in that you will need to sing different pitches to create your own platforms break down barriers and even turn switches on and offwhen you leave silent city the game really starts to open up now you can simply rely on random humming anymore you really have to find the confidence to overcome your inhibitions and sing to match certain tones even if you may look absolutely ridiculous this game shouldn be played in publictrue to its genre there is a wide variety of puzzles you need to solve but unlike other platformers you have to sing high or sing low to progress through the levels you also sometimes have to match the beat of rhythms based on onscreen prompts as well as memorise a song sequence to get bynow while things feel intuitive at first the difficulty level does increase mainly because you often wonder what the heck you supposed to do next i do feel like there a lack of instructions here as it easy to get stuck in one place just because you didn know you could actually cross a certain wall that open up a new scenethe movement also isn linear so you may think you need to go right when you actually need to go left these seemingly little inconveniences add up and it can be frustrating especially when you got a hoarse voice and all you want is for a level to end so you can give your vocal cords a restthankfully the visuals of one hand clapping help mitigate the temptation to ragequit the artwork is just lovely to look at and the ambient soundtrack even lovelier to the ear landscapes are breathtaking and colours are masterfully executed to compliment the vibe of certain levels honestly if it weren for the visuals of the game i would have dnfed this game early onwhat the appealone hand clapping i feel is a bit of a missed opportunity i absolutely love how unique the idea is and the visuals are just topnotch i also really love how you encouraged to let go of your inhibitions to succeed herethat said i got mixed feelings with this title precisely because singing through each level is so darn tiring it doesn feel like a casual game that relax you even if the visuals say otherwise you can adjust the pitch and calibrate your mic sensitivity in the settings but that not enough to help you out of a pinch when you just can seem to hit the right noteadd that to the absence of any real story and any emotional investment in the character and it a little difficult to fall in love with the game it also doesn help that doing a running jump on the touchscreen is just an absolute pain you also likely run out of breath from trying to hold notes for too long if you can even hit the right note at allstill it a great game to try out if you looking for a fresh twist to your average platformer so it still worth a shot for a session or two a day if anything it a creative way to help you find confidence in your voice which isn something you can easily find in video games just like thatas you probably a big fan of platformers you should definitely take a look at these,en,421,Positive
pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/gadgets-and-tech/honor-50-review/,"Honor 50 review - ""Great for social media fans, and a strong show from Honor""",everybody has a phone now in fact quite a few of us have multiple phones over the years the market has fluctuated and shifted but we at a point where a lot of the big phone manufacturers out there are brands that we known of for years honor and their honor enters the market in the strangest of ways though it a brand we know but the manufacturer used to be a label a subcompany while it now stands independent of its former huawei parent companyso the honor is in some ways a debut device a courageous foray into the european market and at an affordable midrange price point too but on the other hand this is a company that has marketed plenty of other phones and devices over the years so there an expectation there for them to not only step forward from the issues be that diplomatic or technical that they had in the past but also to push forward technologicallykey hardware features of honor simultaneously a challenging and unique opportunity and for the most part honor has succeeded from looking at their own list of key features oled display honor supercharge ultra clear camera super curved display qualcomm snapdragon it incredibly clear who they made the phone for the design which features a dual ring design on the back the wraparound screen and a borderstyle wraparound casing element only hammers this in it a phone designed for young social media users it a massive market and the price point opens it up for that audiencewith dimensions of x it actually comes in a little larger than the iphone pro max due to its height that said there a thin black border around the screen and the curvature of the screen on the sides is quite subtle so the screen is about standard for a phone in this size range i never actually been a fan of curved screen phones because i have a permanently broken thumb which means i sometimes miss with gestures and inputsi was pleased with the honor curved screen despite the opportunity being there there were not any misclicks and while the gesturing in from the side is present the gripping fingers and thumbs don seem to conflict with the swiping required to use them in fact the only issue i had with the screen was that sometimes it decided it was locked and other times in a simple standby alwayslit mode these seemed to have different unlock procedures which i didn manage to fully figure out during my time with itwhat about the design of honor a sleek thin design and an incredibly light phone but the rear cameras stick out from the back which makes them as well as the sides feel like gluttons for scratching especially if shoved in a packed pocket or if dropped that said the whole thing feels very dense and robust nothing feels like it going to come loose and that sensation is underlined by the feel of the glass when holding it there was also a thin jellyplastic case included which isn the most stylish choice but serves as a good solution to potential camera crisesthe curved screen feels surprisingly responsive and i didn have any weird experiences when using the phone to play games the refresh rate was really good and the phone ran games like genshin impact wild rift and cookie run kingdom well i didn experience any odd slowdown or delayed loading times one thing that i did notice is that the edges of the screen seemed darker due to the nature of the screen although that didn really cause me any issue but might if it comes to taking precise photosbattery and an exceptional cameraas i said earlier the honor feels like it was designed with a specific audience in mind and that audience is an audience that wants a good battery strong internet capabilities and great camera features the phone delivers in all three regards it compatible out of the box and after i was done with the phone i left it at charge back in its box it persisted for three days before finally turning itself off and even then i turned it back on and it had enough charge to power on about not only does it have a really low background battery usage but it also charges really quick that said the one i received had an eu charger in it so i didn get to see how long it charged with the included chargerthe cameras though they the real centre point here both the front and rear cameras have a lot of different uses on the phone and each features a pullout wideview the main camera the rear camera has a sensor and features a zoom even at elements were distinguishable which is more than can be said for max zoom on other devices there are smaller cameras included too which help with exterior and closeup shots i a sucker for pulling focus onto closeup objects in photos and this phone really delivers on that interestingly though it really really compensates for lowlight much more than my iphone i not decided on whether this is a good thing on not yet but if you take selfies and group photos at night rather than scenic shots then this as default will likely be welcomethat also present on the portrait frontfacing camera bokeh and beauty features are present but even with both of these dialled down there a bit of compensation done by the camera when in a slightlylit room in the evenings blemishes freckles and moles can be lost quite easily due to this which is probably great if you sharing online but is a little bit odd while it does this it take an almost perfect detail from the stuff going on around you a book behind you might have a fully legible title but your freckles are gonevideos look decent tooboth sets of cameras work well for photos but they work great for video you can capture at decent resolutions for both although the wideangle lens will only capture up to but the most interesting thing is the multivideo mode which captures from both cameras at the same time showing your reaction to what you see in realtime i quite often take video calls with my children and we regularly flip the camera or rotate the phone to show what we are talking about this while not compatible with how we stay in touch feels like a peek into the future and is a really cool feature for videobased social mediadoes it have access to google serviceslet dip from new features to the elephant in the room the honor is pretty much fully equipped with the core apps in the google play library you can access google play store youtube gmail and more straight out of the box alongside that you find some of the honor staples that you recognise from over the years i was historically a huawei honor user and while i found some of the elements of their design to be a bit out of synch with the rest of the industry my time with the honor and psmart made me really appreciate the efforts they put into optimisation those tools are still there although you probably not going to have to lean on the optimisation tool as often as i had to back in the day in fact it probably of note that the honor comes preloaded with fewer builtin apps than most of its highrange competitorsas a final note the honor is another victim of the recent antiaudio jack movement there are usbc headphones included which is great and you can obviously grab an adapter but this still feels like a bit of an odd trend that is spreading through the industry quicklyif you looking for a phone that can capture video and photos in a variety of interesting ways can function well at night runs games and media well and has a pretty great battery then you can go wrong with the honor ,en,522,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/gadgets-and-tech/redmi-10-review/,"Redmi 10 review - ""Punching above its price point in more ways than one""",sometimes you not looking for the biggest or best phone out there let face it most of us work on computers for most of the day and there are plenty of people out there who have consoles or pcs for gaming or gasp simply play smaller less intensive games on mobile there definitely a space in the market for something like that and that exactly where xiaomi has inserted the redmi an affordable phone with more than a few surprising featuresxiaomi has an amazing broad product library with their poco mi and redmi lines as well as the various variations within each of those some of their phones really punch above their weight but there always seems to have been a deep amount of respect for the consumer wallet that definitely the case here the redmi comes in at just over which is a really respectable price for a phone of this calibreredmi design and sizethe redmi is a thin little thing although there definitely an unexpected weight to it it just under in width which is frankly ridiculous when you consider that the power button also doubles as a fingerprint scanner it not small though coming in at x it a little bit bigger than the honor which also makes it larger than the iphone pro size only means so much though but the gorilla glass screen doesn wrap around like some of its contemporaries so there is a smaller screen size than othersit a very clean design though the whole phone is incredibly flat and has a simple formfactor with the exception of a lip on the bottom of the front and the roundedrectangle camera piece on the back i still not sure why the current camera design is focused on making the cameras look like they been glued on afterwards but it is a trend that doesn seem to be going away any time soon that said i really like how the back of the redmi looks the slightly rounded shape and the positioning and size of the camera assembly reminds me of old cameras and that nuretro design deliberate or not has grown on me a lot over my time reviewing the phoneif you fancy mobile gamingcarrying on with the exterior of the phone i had the sea blue version which did quite quickly pick up a few fingerprints i was a little confused by this because i know somebody who has a redmi and they said it was quite the opposite i guess that down to the colour phone you get the fingerprint unlock on the power button is a great feature and while i don normally use such things it great to see this extra feature slipped into the design another standout is the fact that it a dual sim phone and there a microsd slot the last few phones i have reviewed haven had memory expansion options which can really be a negative if you photograph a lot or download a lot of games onto your phoneanother feature and i can believe that i celebrating this in but i am is the audio jack the audio quality is pretty great through the jack and it great that somebody out there is still making phones which take that fitting if you not using headphones though the speakers come into play the redmi has two speakers one on the underside and another on the top left of the phone that stereo rather than mono and means that if you using your phone to watch a video in landscape view then you going to have a good time perhaps even a better time than you would have with some toprange phones which tend to have mono speakersredmi screen qualitythe screen quality isn bad at all and there no suspicious dark spots or shadows around the frame of the phone i also like the ui that was used especially the split swipes from the top similar to ios devices you can pull down on one side for notifications and the other for a settings menu it very modern and if you got a busy phone then it be more than welcomeredmi camerasnext up is the cameras the redmi has pretty decent cameras considering the price point with a rear main camera an ultrawide camera a macro camera and a depth camera there also an front camera the macro camera is nice and if you not used one before then that be novel enough i mentioned before that i like taking upclose shots and pulling focus while in those shots for extra emphasis the redmi is great at picking out textures up close however it doesn pick up detail anywhere near the quality of topend phone camerasthe main camera does leave something to be desired when it comes to general brightness and light adjustment however the ultrawide camera works really well in both lowlight and daylight settings the night mode is pretty great if you use that feature however the moment i started using zoom in night mode i started getting a lot of false darkness in the photos i also started to experience some slowdown when i had multiple apps running on the phone and that really affected playing some of the more graphically intense gamesamazing batterybut for this price point these kinds of things are to maybe be expected unlike the jack and great stereo speakers there are more positive notes too it also has an absolutely amazing battery that said it does charge very very slow but if you charge this overnight every second or third day then you going to be laughing while other phones run flatoverall the redmi is a bit of a surprise it a really affordable phone and so the expectation and delivery in some areas is that it would be a standard phone however it has quite a few modern conveniences that would normally only be found in highend phones and so it really ends up punching well above its weight,en,412,Positive
pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/gadgets-and-tech/xiaomi-11t-pro-review/,"Xiaomi 11T Pro review - ""Pro in name, pro in nature""",xiaomi has become a phone manufacturing powerhouse over the past few years and has as a result become one of the most recognised brands in phones that in no small part to the fact that they seem to have deliberately tried to break through in several different pricing tiers we recently wrote about the xiaomi redmi which is an almost budget range phone which punches well above its weight and today we talking about the xiaomi pro a midtop range phone which comes in as the swan song of their phone generationwhile writing about the redmi i mentioned the mi range as one of xiaomi brands it actually turns out that it seems to have been put aside with this the pro taking the place of the normal mi brand range that frankly makes a lot of sense because the phone comfortably operates in the pricing region with a features list that definitely justifies itthe timing might not be idealbut there a large elephant in the room at the time of writing we already starting to hear rumours of the next round of devices and with it there rumoured to be some big changes in the works especially considering some of the android architecture is starting to refresh for other brands of course all we can do at the moment is write about what we have in front of us but it does always make you wonder whether you getting extreme value for money or the final push on old kit when it comes to being on this close to a step in technology it exactly the same with retail pc chipsets as one fades out you can get a major steal on a device but if it just before a massive technology leap then you feel it a lot sooner than if you had hopped onboard midgen for a little bit more moneyxiaomi pro designbut all of that said the pro does feel like a premium topoftheline mobile phone the screen is one of the largest out there with only a small camera hole and a tiny top speaker which is practically in the outer frame and much less visible than on iphones it comes in measuring which is a clear step up from xiaomi previous phones that said it a heavy one as a result of this the phone comes in at over which is a notable increase from xiaomi cheaper devicesfront camerathat tiny little camera hole that i mentioned on the front hides a pretty powerful camera a big step up from the one we used to seeing in the lowmid range phones the portrait mode home to the everpopular bokeh effect has a very good autofocus and is great at picking out outlines of things there still the android penchant of softening faces in standard selfie mode which is always a bit of a weird one for me especially when most camera suites have custom bokeh and beauty sliders the pro comes with an autobeauty style filter on it which actually does a pretty solid job if you do want the phone to tweak your appearance for the picturemain camerathe back camera arrangement is great there are three cameras there the whopping main which does video capture an ultrawide camera and a pretty natty macro lens the cameras are all pretty great i like the ultrawide and was very impressed with how it picked out the outlines and details of things the macro camera was the real standout though it easily one of the best macro cameras out there and the sheer amount of work that the ai does while it up close and personal to the subject is phenomenalthe core camera is pretty good too is definitely in the realms you expect for the price point and it performs pretty well in daylight and lowlight you can definitely read messages while at full zoom but quality does fall away quickly and it noticeable that you zooming by the time you hit zoom night view which has always been an important part of phone photography for me is something that needs to be discussed though the auto night mode is blurry at times but mostly very good i found that i ended up manually changing modes and adjusting the lighting in which case the camera did a great job of picking lines and edges when dealing with lower lightone more thing that needs to be added about the camera though is that the default modes doesn include the super macro mode that hidden in a hamburger menu this is almost criminal considering how good the super macro is there are some other fun elements to play with too long exposure mode moving crowd and neon trails are fun to mess around with but things like this tend to only see limited usevideo capture is great the footage really pops and default lightingcontrast settings are fantastic i love that xiaomi has doubled down on their split video feature which is great for making cool reaction videos i do wish that they could be separated though but maybe that something we see in a future phonesound quality and the infamous audio jackelsewhere there a lot going on there a triple microphone array and the phone features stereo audio the bottom speaker does seem to go much louder than the upper one does however both synch up on volume when you play media so this is a bit of a moot point there a dual sim tray on the bottom which keeps the sides clear the fingerprint scan power button as well as volume controls are on the right side there room for the tray to go there because this is yet another phone that opted to abandon the humble audio jack i not sure what the audio jack did to people exactly but modern design is leaving it behindit stacks a big battery which is lightning fast to chargelet talk about the battery life for a second because that incredibly important when it comes to talking about the pro the battery is substantial and would have been considered groundbreaking just a few short years back that said the phone does eat through it if you use it a lot and have the full refresh rate on but what really impressive is that it takes up to charge this is amazing and the phone can go from flat to charged in about minutes which is no mean feat in fact it should definitely be a major consideration when it comes to purchasing choicethe fact is you can eat all the way through that battery if you wish it an incredibly powerful phone and even when i tried to push it to the extreme by running a dozen apps and playing one of the busiest games on max settings it held up there was zero slow down or hesitation and the phone didn even change temperature much under the pressureit an incredibly welloptimised phone although i wish it wasn preloaded with as many apps or the secondary browser and definitely a decent showing from xiaomi

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/gadgets-and-tech/iphone-13-pro-review/,"iPhone 13 Pro review - ""Enhancements galore""",the mobile phone landscape has changed a lot in the last few years and while the names at the top have stayed the same there been a lot of movement outside of the top two or three names as such big names like apple and samsung can afford to become complacent when you on top it incredibly easy to become overconfident and there are always people throwing around terms like or sayings like vs goliath when it comes to the plucky underdogs that people love to see pushing up the sales chartstable of contentsmajor step forwardas it turns out though with the iphone pro the giants are punching just as hard as they always have if not harder it an amazing step forward from the previous generation and a phenomenal leap forward from the generation moving from the pro max onto the pro shouldn have really been a massive step especially considering that most people are in multiyear contracts and so normally wind up with a new phone once their old one is edging towards obsolescence i can imagine the awe if somebody was to slide from a or generation to this because as i said it was a major step just up from the pro maxiphone pro designthe most noticeable differences are the speed and screen quality which happen to be two extremely visible elements of how phones work perhaps it is the fact that these improvements are so immediately apparent that makes it so impressive most people won know what difference a oled display will have when they spot that in the features list or what a phone having an bionic cpu means but the result is simply that every screen transition and swipe is smoother and the images are crisperin fact these two areas make up three of the main areas of improvement for this generation with the cameras being the third screen resolution and processing power have clearly been major focuses of attention and i can see myself willingly moving away from oled as my main phone after this experiencewhile there naturally always the discussion of high refresh rate fps or hz being useless because the human eye can only take in so much information at once what is this a screen for hummingbirds ramping these up still makes for a smoother experience as we take in smoother information in those moments where we do receive itgaming performances and hardware of iphone prothe iphone pro features the same sized oled components as its predecessor however screensize changes the nub at the top is shrunk and the new frame rate has a lot of collateral effects it seems to light up much brighter and the colours and contrast really stand out versus previous iterations it a much more powerful chipset the bionic which features a sixcore cpu and gpu running alongside of ram makes it probably the most powerful phone out there which is reflected when it comes to running intensive apps like toptier games or editing softwarethat said it incredibly hard to track how much better it is than the competition because apple still doesn let us sample frame rates however running cod mobile alien isolation and genshin impact gives a smooth and sleek experience but as it stands there aren many games out there that can truly challenge the topend category of devices and so we unlikely to see a massive gulf over a few years as nobody wants to lock out the majority of playerson the subject of things where there aren massive gulfs visually the iphone pro isn much of a shift in design from the pro perhaps the most obvious design change is that the camera nest on the back of the device seems to jut out even more and that the screen deadzone around the frontfacing cameras appears to be a little smaller in width although stretches further down the screen a smidge the latter is a sign of longoverdue changes and hopefully it will keep shrinking there are still a lot of games and apps which have shallow topscreen notifications which get lost in the darkness of that areacameranow for the ultimate segue on the subject of darkness we should definitely talk about the iphone pro night mode it makes for a really clear image easily the best that i seen from any of the phones that i tried over the last year in fact the pro is incredibly good at handling various levels of lighting likely due to the increased aperture lens on the main camera maybe most impressive is that the night mode now works on ultrawide and telephoto lenses as well a muchneeded evolution for appletheir camera array has undergone a few upgrades with it now being made up of three rear cameras one of which is the previously mentioned telephoto lens zoom the ultrawide camera didn just receive the nightmode upgrade it also had a new sensor added as well as an autofocus feature which works great in lowlight and really helps it pluck out a little bit more detailoverall the improvements to the main camera as well as the sensor for ultrawide are really standout improvements confusingly though the macro camera now automatically shifts on and off which at first caused a bit of confusion and then caused a little frustration for me it a great little macro camera but as i spend a lot of time taking macroshots and manually setting focus it did mean that i needed to adjust how and where i held the phone in order to stop it from shifting there is reportedly a fix in the works but it confusing how this was included when it went on salebut shiftingmacro aside the iphone pro has probably got the best set of cameras that i handled on a phone nightmode across the other lenses is a great improvement and both the portrait lens and telephoto have improved colour recognition and i very impressed with the bokeh effect in the former as a note i exported photos onto my computer to inspect them as perhaps obviously they look a lot better on the screen than photos would on a screenvideo quality of iphone prowhile talking about photography it makes sense to quickly dip over to video i don spend much time making or taking videos on my phone so i perhaps not the most technicallyappropriate person to talk about it however i do think that the cinematic mode that has been added is worth celebrating it basically takes the portrait mode effect and adds it to video simulating the pulledfocus effect that we often see used to draw attention in films it also tracks as well and so can handle the camera or the subject moving while retaining the effectnot only that but there some clever ai at work if the subject of the recording turns around and looks behind them the focus shifts this also works when people look at and gesture at things while it a little bit uncanny it really steps up the effect and when it works which it does almost of the time it impressesi reviewing the version of the phone which unlike the version can record in the prores mode at the can only muster at that fps prores lends itself well to editing which the phone is more than capable of doing due to its power outside of prores all of the range features dolby vision hdr at up to life and charging speed ofiphone prowith all this talk of processing and recording it makes sense that we discuss an area where apple occupy a bit of a strange place batterylife and charging speed the battery life is improved and i don have to charge it every second day assuming its had light usage however the phone still charges very slow i reviewed some of xiaomi range late last year and while their charge rate of is definitely an outlier the iphone pro only charges at a sixth of that it fine if you work at a desk or charge your phone overnight but it definitely an area where the giant needs to improve in future maybe we see the next generation shifting from lightning cable to usbcthe iphone pro is easily one of the strongest phones on the market and in several areas it easily tops the competition pricing is an obvious elephant in the room but i sure anybody reading this knows that iphones are topshelf pricing in no small part due to the ecosystem that you buy into but as this review underlines also the fact that they punch

games that spawned from the blockbuster franchise alien alien isolation has been the one diamond in the rough that shines as an inspiration to all movie tiein video games now i am sure that phrase fills players and indeed moviegoers anywhere with a sense of dread and trepidationtable of contentsthe expectation is that you will usually encounter one of two flavours there are the bland cash grabs that just latch onto a movies popularity to pump out a generic but overall inoffensive game to bring in some easy money look at any of the transformers games from the michael bay eraor much worse you have the oh god what is this monstrosity burn it and the movie it came from just get it away from me flavour let pick an obvious punching bag for this second type et the extraterrestrial a game notoriously so bad that they simply buried a bunch of cassettes of it hoping to forget about the whole thing alien isolation bucked this trend in the best way possible and now the stealth masterpiece is available for players to download on ios and androidalien isolation storyfor those of you that did not play the original it set years after the original alien film and tasks you with playing as amanda ripley the daughter and exact copy of series protagonist ellen ripley amanda is invited along to the salvage ship anesidora which has recently located the flight recorder of the nostromo the ship from the original film what is supposed to be a quick and easy recovery of this recorder almost immediately falls apart as there is an unknown predator stalking what remains of the ships crew all of whom have now split into factions and will shoot at anything that looks vaguely suspiciousalso readseeing as the player is working alone on the ship surrounded by hostile groups of humans who are in turn also being stalked by an alien intent on sticking its claws through anyone it can find you mainly rely on stealth to try and survive long enough to get off the ship you can find various tools to assist with this endeavour ranging from a motion tracker to know which direction to run away from to noisemakers so you can distract that rather meanlooking bloke with a big gun up ahead this is precisely what you will be wanting to do because the touchscreen controls on the mobile version can be a bit of a handfulalien isolation controlsyou move around with the standard two thumb setup you have the virtual joypad on the left for your movement and then you swipe around on the right to look around and aim your weapons both of these work well so far as they are functional however i personally found issues with just how sensitive they were your speed is determined by how far you push the joypad forward however the threshold between walking and sprinting is fairly smallthis is normally fine but when you are crouching and trying to be as inconspicuous as possible but accidentally push that joypad a bit too far as you try to will the door closer you are suddenly no longer crouching you are instead now automatically sprinting at full speed and whilst alien isolation does boast some excellent ai even a game with awful ai would have its enemies notice this and subsequently eat you i looked in the settings extensively and i could not find a way to turn off either the auto sprint or the automatic crouch cancellingaiming sensitivity issuesanother issue i had was with aiming sensitivity when i first loaded up the game and tried to turn left i was spinning like a ballerina even after turning down the trackpad sensitivity to the minimum i still found it a bit difficult to get precise movement whilst aiming which when you find yourself encountering guntoting enemies is not an ideal time to be busting out that saturday night fever impression as you trying to get the reticule to go where you want it your enemies will probably enjoy the show for about two seconds before they get bored and decide to shoot firstatmospherethese two problems however are nothing compared to the biggest problem i found atmosphere the main reason survival horror games thrive is because it makes the players feel genuine emotion you are scared of the shadows because something could be hiding there you are afraid of opening that door because of what could lurk behind it you are afraid of accidentally hitting that empty tin can because even the slightest noise can cause the big bad to burst through that wall and give you a heart attackthis is why we play these games and while playing on a tablet i did not feel anything close to that it is hard to get drawn into the atmosphere when it on a smaller screen and even harder still when you are trying to get that terror from a screen that permanently has two thumbs in the wayferal interactive did a very just job translating most of the controls down to a phonetablet screen and you can survive with the sensitive controls you could even play it with a bluetooth controller instead and avoid these problems completely however for me i cant help but feel like you lose some of the atmosphere that alien isolation was so heavily applauded for when playing on a smaller screen,en,425,Positive

little lines like this that really make sumire shine both as a game and as a memorable protagonist in sumire you follow the tale of a shy young girl in a japanese mountain town slowly discovering what it like to live a socalled perfect day while the game is short at just a little over three hours the whole experience and all the feels it made me go through will stay with me for a long long timethe story of sumirethe gorgeous visual novelslashchoose your own adventure game starts off with sumire waking up from a dream about her beloved grandmother who recently passed sumire feels like her grandmother wants to tell her something so she left with a sense of longing about seeing her again as she mulls over these thoughts in the middle of the night she stumbles upon a magical flower in her house who promises to fulfill one wish for her in exchange for a wonderful day and so begins sumire enchanted and emotional talethroughout the game you encounter different townsfolk and magical creatures along the way and they all remember sumire grandmother very fondly the day seems to be clouded in a surreal mist or blanketed in a veil of overwhelming sadness to be honest almost as if the day is not quite real but still real enough the whole story happens in the course of a single day so you really have to pick the right choices to make each moment countwritten and directed by michael ely sumire made me cry the last time this happened was when i finished uncharted and that because i knew the characters and journeyed with them from the very beginning of the franchise but with sumire you get to know her and her world only for a few hours and already you feel like she always been a part of your life or at least make you wonder where she been all this timesumire gameplay and graphicsas sumire goes about her one magical day you can interact with items and creatures in the background in a pointandclickesque manner picking things up and delivering objects to people just to tick things off your list sumire has jotted down what constitutes a perfect day for her in her little notebook but apart from these main objectives you can also accept a quest or two from a wayward frog or a lovestruck snake here and there just be sure to remember their favours as the day only passes by oncein particular i promised a dear scarecrow friend i come back for him because he didn think he make it past noon and when i forgot about my task i came back to find him dead in my yard but that not even the worst blow yet i get to that laterchoices you make aren all black and white either sometimes what you might think is the right thing to do actually makes things worse for example me helping feed a crane family somehow ended up with his memory being wiped leaving him an empty shell with no memory of his own family it just goes to show you that real life is filled with shades of grey and there nothing you can do but roll with the punchesat the risk of spoiling the beautiful beautiful story sumire needs to face certain realities in her life in order to have a truly wonderful day she and her exbest friend chie have drifted apart and the boy she been crushing on is moving away to the big city the next day her father left her and her mom simply because he didn love them anymore and she somehow has to struggle with her memories of her grandmother and learn to move on without herit this kind of bittersweet setting that we find our lovable protagonist in and it a bit too much of a burden for a young girl to have to carry still sumire keeps her innocence on the inside and her heart on her sleeve making each line of dialogue deeply earnest thoughtprovoking and alltooheartbreaking at the same timewhat the appealsumire made me cry cathartic tears thanks to the brilliant writing and the stirring soundtrack that always seems to be out to get you at every turn the acoustic background music and the ethereal vocals from the japanese band tow are topnotch the gorgeous painterly visuals aren helping they cast everything in an otherworldly and very nostalgic glow adding to the emotional impact of every sceneand it not even the more grandiose things that really got to me it the tiny seemingly insignificant stuff that tugged at my heartstrings and brought on the waterworks i can really stress how beautiful this game is inside and out without spoiling the story but for instance when one of the townsfolk was talking about his wife he casually mentioned that they looked at each other across the dinner table one night and realized that there was nothing left to say it broke my heart into a million little pieceslines like this are littered throughout the entire game and if this were an actual novel i would have devoured every single line of prose characters are all likable and memorable and each one has a special interaction with sumire that hides deep philosophical wisdom with every encounter the fact that it all happens in a single day with no way to return makes everything even more bittersweet sumire will have to learn to live with her choices and her life both the good and the bad aspects of it when the sun setsof course it not all about ninjas chopping onions here sumire does have lighthearted moments of childhood innocence such as minigames with friends and opportunities to go shopping there are also dark almost horroresque moments in the game which are all part of sumire character development and story arcif i could give this game more than a perfect score i would there honestly nothing negative about the game i can think of other than me wishing there was more but even the game runtime is already perfect as it is any longer and it might ruin the impact of sumire perfect day suffice it to say that it really moved me in more ways than one and if you eager to experience the same thing you carry sumire little tale and the lessons learned from it long after the credits roll,en,460,Positive

that long ago that we weighed in on ubisoft lawsuit with apple and google which resulted in the swift delisting of area a closequarters shooter which bore a striking resemblance to rainbow six siege and now we got yet another fairly highprofile gauntlet being thrown down before apple feet but this time it something i can really get behind loot boxesthe loot box debate has been waged before with countries such as belgium outright banning loot boxes much to the ire of big companies such as ea and activision with that in mind the question of whether or not loot boxes are gambling or can be seen as gambling has already been had and governments have accepted that there something to look into here but the mobile market is a bit differentalmost since its inception the mobile market has lived and died on free to play titles yes i know there are plenty of you out there that do not spend a penny on inapp purchases and some of you that stick to premium titles because of monetisation practices but it very hard to avoid if you a regular pocket gamer like i amthe facts are set in stone the mobile market needs free to play titles and those titles need a monetisation system that doesn bombard the player with unlimited ads so what can be done to uphold the mobile market status quo while still conceding a few pointsany game where you collect something knows about gacha mechanics whether it in fate grandorder granblue fantasy or even raid shadow legends we have all experienced gacha mechanics it simple you either use ingame or premium currency to purchase a pull or a summon and you will get rewarded with a creature to keep and fight withcan gacha be considered similar to loot boxes well yes absolutely it something the player can spend real money on without being certain of what they will receive that is essentially a loot box heck while we here we should probably include hearthstone packs as loot boxes toothe problem with gacha games and loot boxes is the not knowing strides have been made with this with previous lawsuits resulting in gacha games now having to reveal the appearance rates for all of their characters and items but all that does is reveal how very much the odds are stacked against youand none of this helps the key point of this recent lawsuit kids are often the primary players of free to play games and if loot boxes and gacha mechanics really do inspire a compulsive response in these kids similar to gambling then they should not play them the unfortunate truth is that if we want to avoid sparking compulsive behaviour in children like rats hitting buttons for a treat they can play these games at all even with apple parental controlsright now you can see from the store page of a game on the app store whether or not it includes inapp purchases but in the modern day they almost all do and this certainly doesn separate moneyhungry gacha titles from games which simply sell dlc or content packs it the difference between the ace attorney selling multiple full games as individual downloads and the love island game making you buy gems for extra scenarioswith parental controls on ios you are able to prevent child accounts from spending money on the app store and block inapp purchases but that not enough if we worried about compulsive behaviour then even the ingame methods of earning premium currency and spending it on gacha and loot boxes are too much these are precisely the mechanics that we must remove from games in order to avoid compulsive behaviour and quite frankly gacha games and card games like hearthstone thrive on it almost exclusivelygrand theft auto v got a big reveal for the playstation recently with gta online coming to all owners for free a nice addition sure but of course it just the online component because rockstar make incredible money from the online component alone so much so that they opened a virtual casino in the gamethis is questionable but we haven heard any controversy surrounding it that simply because gtav is not a kid game it is agerestricted and while some kids may play it they have had an adult make the purchase or should done at least this might inspire compulsive spending in some players and likely does given the amount of money they rake in but as long as they sensible adults and not young children it acceptable enoughso what is the solution well it both simple and difficultfirst apple needs to highlight games on the app store which include what we call random purchases and allow parental controls to entirely block the downloads of those games this is essentially age restricting them unless parents give express consentsecond someone needs to watch the game developers i logged into roblox recently don ask it wasn fun and aside from being shocked at how y bad the game is i couldn believe how filled it was with spending potential around every corner there something to spend robux on which is a premium currency of course this is a game expressly aimed at kids and expressly wanting them to spend money this cannot be acceptable quite frankly it feels insidious and creepy in ways i do not want to share apple or some independent watchdog needs to keep an eye on these kinds of games especially the ones which have a clearly young audiencethe first point should be simple enough though large developers and publishers such as supercell and king which both also have a young casual audience will likely revolt let them languish i saythe second point is much harder an independent watchdog seems like a lot to ask for but we wouldn have this issue in the first place if apple were more willing to safeguard children in the first placelong story short the mobile gaming market will need to change drastically if it wants to keep away from pesky lawsuits like these in the future,en,440,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/fury-unleashed/app-army-assemble/,"App Army Assemble: Fury Unleashed - ""Does this side-scrolling roguelite shooter translate well to mobile?""",after releasing on steam awesome games studios has launched its sidescrolling roguelite shooter fury unleashed for ios it promises plenty of action with players blasting their way through numerous enemies and bosses along the way they can use the combo system to make the combat more enthralling but how well does the fastpaced gameplay translate to mobile we handed the game over to our resident experts the app army to find outhere what they saidbrian wigingtoni can help but start this review by asking if you like castlevania games metroid contra roguelites well what if you blended those genres into a stew that is heavy on the contra this is how i feel playing fury unleashed and it pretty great i love that we get a consolequality game packed with features and replay value the game essentially consists of a comic book style story told in panels with an interesting flair your heavily armed character runs and guns through levels that scroll in all directions while you take out monsters via a dualstick shooter scheme there are tons of weapons and powerups and there is a procedurally generated system of levels the game is tough but fair in my opinion in that the purpose is to challenge the player to improve their character in order to survive longer and go furtheri lasted through several weapons upgrades and quite a few rooms before getting totally destroyed at a moment notice i was not discouraged and jumped right back in to continue the fight the game has quite detailed backgrounds with a good amount of variety and the sounds are appropriately punchy for all the weapons fury unleashed simply has that one more try feeling that will make it a mainstay on my phone i mainly played with my razer controller and the controller support was excellent i highly recommend this game if you love action games or shooters but roguelites or roguelikes have bored you in the past the system of upgrades and fast action is really great and satisfyingdt stroscheini can see why this game currently has a out of rating in the app store this is a very well put together a gem of a game you dropped into a living comic book where pages are levels that change as you progress through panels levels are laid out metrovania style but a bit more bitesized rooms to explore enemies to kill for their ink which acts as currency challenges to find and secrets as a shooter i can help but feel some nostalgia for contra with the different weapons and movement but fury unleashed is in a league of its own this is a very challenging roguelike there are some really nice rpg elements to juice up your character you can equip and hold different range and melee weapons as well as gear there are a lot of upgrades gear that changes your appearance and weapons to be had to make your character unique to your liking i love that there is a pretty rich hero stats menu that breaks down just about everything toothe graphics are rich and colourful very detailed overall you can tell a lot of time and love was spent just watching backgrounds to levels come alive in even the smallest things the music and sound effects blend perfect making the game really come to life the enemies and huge boss battles are very fun and different keeping the gameplay fresh touch controls are as responsive as you can ask and there controller support there is also coop support to add to the mayhem adding to an already highly replayable gamefury unleashed is a premium game and nothing less this game is a complete package with high replayability and i don see it falling into backlog any time soonoksana ryanthis game has an interesting twist in as much as you are playing within a graphic novel i like the look of the game the controls are easy to use but sometimes a little hit and miss and there is plenty to explore weapons are unlocked and again these are plentiful from swords to grenades and lots of upgrades and there are creatures large and small to combat through the various levels the pace is as fast as you want it to be with various difficulty levels and characters that can be swapped unfortunately when you die you start again from the beginning but you dont necessarily start where you did previously so it isnt as repetitive as it sounds all in all i enjoy playing this game and i would definitely recommend itadam rowethe first impression from fury unleashed is fantastic the game has great music graphics and a comic book art style that pops it feels like a premium experience the text is a little small when reading on a phone screen even with a screen as large as the xs max you can adjust the ui scale in the settings but it still felt small even to my eyes other than that one minor gripe i had no complaints the gameplay is also topnotch i started playing via touch controls and i felt a little slower than what the game seemed to expect of me but it was playablei kept missing my intended buttons or jumping into things that i hadnt intended but that is true of any touch control scheme where you cant feel the buttons under your fingers after a few runs i tried the game with a backbone controller and there it absolutely shined suddenly i was flying around the levels deftly avoiding projectiles jumping on enemies heads and smashing them like mario and racking up a huge combo meter after each run i was excited to upgrade my character and try it again fury unleashed has a great feedback loop fluid gameplay and beautiful graphics if you like action platformers andor roguelites you should give this game a try especially if you have a controller to play withtorbjrn kmbladunleash the fury from when a truly angry metal dude named yngwie malmsten expressed his irritation to much amusement fury unleashed takes some of that intense anger and mashes it into a combined metroidvania and metal slug hellish shooter is something we have seen quite a lot on ios but fury unleashed takes it a bit further refining the bitesized action with a bit of story and weapon development it controls well using touch controls albeit it might be far easier using an mficontroller but i could not find that optionshoot stab jump repeat there is also an option to play coop online but i only dabbled in the singleplayer game i found a premium experience and had quite a blast traversing the missions within the missions you also get to play out various challenges such as kill x enemies without getting hit in x amount of time fury unleashed is easy to recommend with seemingly quite a lot of content since it is randomly generated i for one unleashed the furysubscribe to pocket gamer on chad jonesi really had a lot of fun with fury unleashed part action platformer part roguelike with difficulty settings easy and hard is unlocked right away the other are not unlocked as well as other special ways to play the superhot way you only have hp and crypt of the necromancer where you play by the rhythm of the music they were pretty fun and made a nice extra touch to an already solid game i liked that there is a bloodless mode so i could play it around my younger kids that were curious and wanted to play for themselvesthe touch controls weren too bad to play with but i also connected my controller and it worked like a charm which is also a nice touch i loved the style of this game and the challenge and i really had a great time and look forward to completing the hard level and going from there it took me a couple of hours to beat the easy mode and will take a bunch more time to beat the hard mode each run you level up your character and get skill points to make your next run through a bit easier lots to unlock and many weapons to play with along the way my only regret is that i didn find this game soonerjc gai really appreciate the roguelike part the feeling that each play gives points so you can optimize the character is addictive and the different weapons and the generation of the levels are wellprogrammed avoiding any monotony the music is very appropriate and stimulating the graphics are neat but i find them somewhat lacking in originality fortunately the references to a comic book are successful for gameplay the touch controls are precise but their positions are not actually customizable and even on a phone the button for jumping is quite far from the joystick for shooting so the second big level requires more speed and precision becomes difficult overall it offers a fastpaced experience with a lot of fun that i recommend to all shooting platformer loversmatt arenthe story is that your creator has lost faith in you restore his faith and confidence by battling your way through the pages of his comic once more regaining your lost power along the way fury unleashed graphics are quite good packing a surprising amount of detail into a small space i appreciate the visual differences between weapons and various effects no slowdown or lagging noticed while in graphically heavy doss battles the music adjusts to the level of action on screen and your current combo drawing you into the game as things get exciting all of the weapons ive used so far have distinct sounds to tell them apartthe gameplay is similar to an action platformer scenes are reduced to comic book cells in a nod to the story its a nice touch controls are intuitive and easy to use building combos through consecutive kills can lead to greater rewards and resource collection helps you upgrade between missions theres also a surprising amount of depth to the effect of your weaponarmour choices have on gameplay conveniently there is a save and quit feature so you wont lose anything to a short session fury unleashed is fast fun engaging and gory the kind of shooter where you might find yourself laughing at the mayhem on screen in my opinion this is a must buy gameeduard pandelegoodlooking and mostly fun arcade shooterplatformer with rpg elements that offer a lot of playtimethe goodthe badmakara noufirst let me address the elephant in the room the control scheme is translated very well into touch control the right stick is really good and can be used for shooting in any direction if we talk about touch control in general its a great stepup the game also supports physical controllers which is another plus its a roguelike shooting platformer game but instead of going from left to right you also go up and down in boxlike dungeonsits a very fastpaced action game you can enjoy using a melee attack bombs and a variety of guns yes guns lots of guns and the story presents in a comic book style the music also maximizes my experience by making shooting feel super satisfying i was surprised to learn that i could also customize characters my only complaint is my current progress will be removed if i join an online coop but as its fastpaced and players will restart a lot thats probably not too big a dealmark abukoffive been thinking about trying this game but kind of on the fence because of the price tag so i was excited to see it show up in an app army assemble and now i can say that i would have been very happy with my purchase first off the art style is fun youre fighting inside and throughout a comic book lots of weapon variety powerups melee weapons grenades dark matter guns the onscreen controls are sufficient but its a lot better with a controller i started with onscreen controls and occasionally struggled but once i was using the backbone and oriented myself it really took off this is a roguelite game which means that youre going to die at some point and while you retain your unlocks and character progression you start over on levels which are procedurally generated so its never the same twice the weapons are wide and varied and fun and the powerups help triple jumpcons to the game in my opinion minor the story element is really barebones compared to the fun interesting in that it involves the world outside but within the comic itself with occasional glimpses into the unhappy psyche of the artist and there isnt a lot of depth to the main character but i see this as a firstrate die hardramboterminator shooter and thats honestly more than enough im not playing for a lifelike character and deep compelling storyline i want a fun nostalgic arcade shootem up with cool art even the comic book covers look great and wild bosses and thats what this game is all about if youre looking for a deep story you might want to look elsewhere but if youre looking for an awesome arcade shooter a la huntdown youre going to be very happy with this this one is a standout for the genre and i can enthusiastically recommend itwhat is the app armythe app army is pocket gamer lovely community of mobile game experts as often as possible we ask them for their thoughts on the latest

events,as it been recently announced in the mobile legends bang bang patch of november quite a few changes are about to hit the arena we know and love which will affect a number of championsin short good ol clint has been reworked receiving a new kit that better fits the current game meta a new champion has been added some other champions have been adjusted and a couple of new timelimited events are on underway so if you curious to see what patch has brought to the game let dive right innewsnew hero mathildathe swift plumeskill soul bloom mathilda resonates with the power of ancestors and summons whisps that surround her with the movement distance increased more and more wisps will be attracted to her capped at wisps after casting this skill or reaching the time limit the power of ancestors will guide the wisps to attack nearby enemies each time dealing magic damage damage is reduced when hitting the same targetskill guiding wind mathilda creates a field surrounding her and leaps forward upon landing she gains a shield and movement speed the allied units who come in contact with this field will receive the same shield also and guiding wind after using guiding wind the hero will be guided to mathilda and both of them will gain the same movement speed when using this skill during circling eagle mathilda will not change her position mathilda will reclaim all guiding wind if it is used by an allied heroultimate circling eagle mathilda applies a soul mark to the targeted hero and then circles around the target for up to during this period wisps will rush to nearby enemies each time dealing magic damage after casting this skill or reaching the time limit she will rush to the target knocking back enemies on the path stunning them and dealing magic damage mathilda gains control immunity and shield during her circlingpassive ancestral guidance mathilda gains ancestral guidance while moving when it is fully charged her next basic attack will be enhanced dealing magic damage to the target and increasing her movement speedconclusion she a new support class hero which is going to wreak havoc in the land of dawn she seems quite powerful at first glance since her kit is mainly designed to facilitate allies movement towards enemies offering them shields as well as dealing quite a bit of damage to the opponent with a passive skill like hers it should be almost impossible for an enemy to scape mathildarevamped hero clint the west justiceskill quick draw clint shoots bullets rapidly the bullets will hit the enemies in a fanshaped area in turn the damage dealt

grenade in a designated direction he can store up to grenades at a timepassive double shot each time clint casts the skill he will shoot his rifle with his next basic attack dealing great damage in a straight lineconclusion from a rather low tier unit clint rework seems to show a little love for the cowboy making his new kit way more friendly towards the role he plays a marksman his new skills seem to be revolving around his old passive skill now reworked completely which to be honest is quite interesting in addition to that his old skill heel rope trapping recoil is now immobilizing enemies instead of just slowing them making it a way better addition to his kit overall it seems like the rework might have just put clint back on the a and higher tier list given the amount of utility and damage he brings to the table nowhero adjustmentsbrodybase physical attack growth speed growth atk speed gaining ratio adjusted base damage physical attack bonus damage increase ratio for every target penetrated with the limit nerfed extra damage for each stack of the target lost hp scales with skill levelconclusion because of his op snowballing in the early stages of the game his kit

the ancestral blade model have been updated as wellirithelpassive slightly nerfed physical attack bonus of each arrow damage buffed movement speed increased by during ultimateconclusionthere is no major crazy change in her kit they basically reduced her damage slightly but given her a tad bit of extra movement speed during ultimate to catch up with most enemies and unleash her flurry it quite a nice adjustment for the late game where she will be able to pretty much stomp thanks to the extra movement speedclaudehis damage before purchasing demon hunter sword has been increasedultimate buff base damage of each hit to minions damage to minions is now slightly lower which makes his clear speed in the early game a little bit slower but because of the major damage increase to his ultimate that won really matter in the end game also after he purchases the demon hunter sword he will probably be stronger than beforekajapassive buffed extra damage of enhanced basic attack to minions and creeps of max hpconclusionnot much has changed other than his farming speed that means that he is finally on par with other supports and can now bring about a lot more utility to the table earlier on additionally the recommended build has been changedhelcurtskill adjusted silences targets slows targetsskill nerfed base damage physical attack bonus damage to minions and creeps adjusted slows

have an impact in the earlier game stages but shouldn be an issue at max rankchouattributes buffed hp growth adjusted physical attack bonus of the shield nerfed removed control immunity when casting the second phase of the ultimate optimized the skill to ensure its actual and displayed effects are consistentconclusion the aim of this adjustment was to enhance the experience when fighting against chou but in order to avoid nerfing him completely his survivability has been also increasedesmeraldaskill adjusted duration base shield cooldown reduction for each nonhero unit hit adjusted skill cooldown reduction for each hero unit hit nerfed now the cooldown starts upon casting or the end of chargingconclusion all of these rather small adjustments kinda nerfed esmeralda more specifically her ultimate it not a major dealbreaker but it is something to keep in mind whenever taking part in team fightskhufraskill nerfed max moving distanced reduced by nerfed unable to block the battle spell flickerconclusion these two nerfs are mostly situational if you use skill at a certain time the moving distance will not matter that much however the nerf on skill might set a few drawbacks for khufra mains who will have to adapt to these changesuranusultimate nerfed shield and hp regen boost nerfed removed the reduction of targets physical attack and magic powerconclusion these two nerfs will make uranus less tanky so if you fighting against him you might be at an advantage if you playing uranus it should affect his ability to allin and survive so he needs to be played slightlysaferluo yiskill adjusted skill width and casting speed increased by mana cost base damage buffed cooldown reduction provided by this skill these adjustments should make luo yi a better unit

scenario as you might have guessed there will be a battle between good and evil or rather between the immortals and the shadowswhile the game will experience several familiar features such as the destructive environment rifts and quests there is one major difference that basically places diablo immortal in an entirely different universe from diablo ii and iii the skill casting mana will be completely removed as well as every other classspecific resource instead a cooldown system will be in placewho is developing itthe game will be a collaboration between blizzard entertainment and netease which is a wellestablished company with plenty of popular titles under its belt from onmyoji to lifeafter and extraordinary ones the company is known to be a force in the mobile gaming scenewhen will diablo immortal be releasedfinally we have the official release date for diablo immortal and it june you can check the announcement in the video belowif we check on play store we will see the coming soon placeholder and can preregister for the gamethere too and since march apple users are also able to preregister and you both get a nice set of horadrim cosmeticsthe closed beta is out now but it limited to a few regions onlyin one of their announcements blizzard stated that the closed beta will start on october the sad part is that it will be limited to canada and australia for nowin november the diablo immortal closed beta got expanded to japan china and south korea they also announced necromancer as the latest addition to existing classes it also had a couple of patch releases and a first official eventas of february the closed beta has just come to an end and that takes us one step closer to the official diablo immortal release datehow will diablo immortal playin diablo immortal the graphical style will be a mishmash between diablo ii and diablo iii not as simple and pixelated as in ii and not as smooth as in iii fairly simplified isometric graphics make adjusting to the mobile platform a lot easier so don expect them to be highly defined as in other mobile mmorpgsas far as the gameplay goes the multiplayer element should balance out the singleplayer one allowing for plenty of features that resemble your typical mmos such as guilds multiplayer dungeons and shared social spaces but also rich singleplayer dungeons after thewhy has the game has not been released yetthere could be a number of reasons why the game has not yet been released and why there has been such little information on it for start the world hasn exactly been the same the pandemic hit and that set back everyone including developers worldwide secondly after blizzcon we know that blizzard is also working on other titles in parallel including diablo iv could it be that they dedicating fewer resources to it we don knowall we know for sure is that the game is currently an alpha testing in australia and that only means it bound to release sooner or later let hope for the formercan we play it on pcthe short answer to this would be no diablo immortal will not be playable on pc if you are running emulators it could be possible but they need to have the following requirements minimumrecommendedosandroid os lollipop and higherprocessorsnapdragon hisilicon kirin hisilicon kirin gb gb gb internal spacewill diablo immortal be on switch what about controller supportwhat we know for sure is that the game will feature touchscreen controls yes nintendo switch does indeed have touchscreen capabilities but sadly we can say for sure that it will be available if we were to rely solely on what matthew burger said during a qa session at blizzcon in yes its also on the switch youre rightas for the controller support wyatt cheng claimed the following in a reddit post we are actively investigating controller support the main challenge right now is that full controller support isn just movement and skill usage it also menus inventory management paragon trees npc uis chat etc to set some expectations we would love to see controller support but full controller support may not make the release version of the gametldr we might not get controller support at launch but it most certainly something we will see in the futurehow to play diablo immortalat the moment the game is in closed beta stages which is locked only for australia japan korea and a few other regions make sure you follow the official diablo immortal twitter pagebecause they sometimes hold random draws where players can win access to the closed betais the game free freetoplay game will be available for free it will be completely freetoplay but there will be some sort of monetization and iaps of course it diablo so all of the equipment will be available only via grinding hopefully not for hundreds of hoursmost of the iaps will consist of crests which will be used with elder rifts for varied rewards reforge stones specialized reforged stones and you guessed it a battle passthe ageold question diablo immortal vs diablo ivwhen it comes to new names there will never be a shortage of them however in the diablo world this is something quite different while we eagerly expecting new names those names need to meet certain player expectations diablo immortal and diablo iv are different games the former is a game entirely for mobile while the latter is a pc gamenow that we shed some light on some of the crucial aspects of the game let take a look at some more information that you might be interested in we won get into too much detail so you should find these brief answers short and to the pointa the current classes are barbarian monk necromancer wizard demon hunter crusader for more info take a look at our classes guidea yes it will be at the moment the game is in the alpha testing period but once it will be released it will be available for ios usersa yes it will have a pvp feature the battlegrounds where players can partake in pvp battlesa most certainly it is not we expect it to be released in june the game will be online so players will require a steady connection to the interneta there is no certain answer to this question at this point in time while we all too familiar with the mobile games being mostly through microtransactions the actual game requires people to acquire their equipment only by playing and slaying enemies unless there will be some sort of trade system which turns premium currency into gametradeable items it probably won become paytowina to gain access to alpha or beta testing you need a special key follow the game social media because sometimes they hold alpha testing access giveaways at the moment however the beta phase has just come to an end and that means we one step closer to the official releasea warbands are a feature meant to encourage players to team up sort of like parties running dungeons that has been expanded in the beta testing and we definitely going to see it introduced in the official launch,en,568,Positive
pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/arabilis-super-harvest/app-army-assemble/,"App Army Assemble: Arabilis: Super Harvest - ""Does farming, puzzles and roguelike elements make for a good mix?""",arabilis super harvest is a farmingbased game from developertim overvliet that recently released for ios and android it sees players setting about planting crops using colour matching mechanics although that might sound like a relaxing time the game throws several roguelike mechanics into the mix to make everything a bit trickier we decided to hand the game over to our app army to see how they handled the pressures of farm lifehere what they saidmark abukoffi didnt have a lot of time to give to this this week but its an interesting gardening simulatorpuzzler that basically involves planting different kinds of crops in gardens of various sizes timing and techniques and placement come into play there are different modes of play either relaxing with no weather or animals to worry about or you can play with random challenges each timethe music is appropriate for the game but wasnt really to my taste the mechanics are simple and the tutorial takes you through them quickly and effectively all in all im not really a fan of gardening simulator games so it didnt really do much for me on that level but i think its wellmade with appealing graphics and an interesting puzzle mechanic with just enough time pressure to keep you moving if you like puzzles and gardening simulators youll probably enjoy thischad jonesi love garden sim type games and i like a lot of puzzle games at first take i went through the tutorial and my first thought was wow there are a lot of different mechanics to this puzzler hoping i would not be completely lost i found myself understanding this game the more i played through it and i would recommend playing the relaxing mode before you hit the challenging mode just because it would benefit you in better learning the end game of the puzzler but do not feel bad if you feel a bit lost i thought the visuals were just fine plus i really don mind the pixelated style graphics as well as the music if you like puzzle games i think there a lot here to learndiscover and it will keep you coming back i definitely want to spend more time with it and attempt to master its mechanicshope sellersthe game music is very relaxing but i still feel confused on the game mechanics i just tried matching the plants to the last one like it said and kept getting a top score somehow haha but i think i just need to more time with the game but if you like puzzles and are good at them and cute pixel graphics then youll love this game i dont hate it just need more time because im a little bad at puzzlesbruno ramalholovely little puzzler we got here cute pixelized graphics cute soundtrack and cute animal characters that talk to us warning us that something is about to happen i like the varied mechanics of the game where you have to connect various types of seeds in the ground which in turn will evolve into some kind of vegetable and even a super vegetable if surrounded by all sides by fullgrown vegetables we have to be very good at positioning seeds as they will only connect with others from specific sides and we need those connections so they can grow especially when we get to harvest time if we have any seeds with no connections we lose them and thats one step closer to a game overthe mechanics of the game keep evolving and there are even animals that we have to take care of that try to eat our vegetables we bump them on the head whacamole style theres a tutorial in the beginning that i found a little bit confusing at first but there was a problem with the positioning of vegetables on the ground that was promptly fixed by an update and then it all clicked i will surely play this game some more as there are a lot of techniques to be developed to get a high score fun gamepierpaolo morganteash is a wellcrafted puzzle game where the goal is to plant crops and harvest them crops need to have three roots to be fully grown something that can only be achieved if the player strategically places them harvesting is done automatically after a given amount of time all in all ash is fun to play and it has a high replayability value since the gardens for your crops vary in size depend on the season and can be affected by random events such as animals the graphics are pretty although the hen that walks the player through the tutorial is a little creepy i think ash is worth giving a try considering that it has been developed by a single person absolutely recommended to anyone who enjoys puzzle gamesbrian wigingtoni am a sucker for a good match x game and i have enjoyed several farmbased ones before at first arabilis seemed like a bit of a handful due to the multiple ways to match and the time component to harvest your fruits and veggies the tutorial has multiple parts to help understand most of the concepts pretty well although some may prefer to go through it twice to make sure you have it down essentially you are tasked with filling your garden which is a grid of square dirt plots with various veggie and fruit seedlings to grow the best and biggest crops when harvest time comes planting the same typecolour of plant adjacent to each other is key in order to grow themthere are ways to get big bonuses by doing things like surrounding a crop on all sides with the same plant to create a huge veggie or fruit when harvest time comes the crops that have been produced will be harvested and any seeds that haven grown yet are lost therein lies the strategy to stay profitable and keep things moving i did enjoy the various strategies which are shown in the training levels and i can see that the game goes a bit deeper than some other games of this type however those in search of a simple match type of game may get turned off due to the different style of gameplay and the bit of time pressure due to the harvest mechanici liked the pixel graphics and the music while a little bland at times was rather soothing i feel like the asking price is reasonable considering it is pretty well made and has a neat style not quite like other matchingfarming games if you want something a little different that will take a bit of time to master arabilis may be right up your alleyoksana ryanthis game is interesting and easy to play once the tutorial has been completed compared to many games the tutorial is very comprehensive and split into sections for easy learning the retro graphics are cute the background musicsounds fit the retro feel and the gameplay is easy to graspinstead of the usual plant and grow style games arabilis requires you to match plant roots in patterns to grow a bumper crop and if you are clever with the planting you can grow super vegetables that are many times the size of the crop around it there are seasons to follow and various crops to plant giving the game plenty of variety there is definitely lots here for lovers of this genrewhat is the app armythe app army is pocket gamer lovely community of mobile game experts as often as

downloaded mobile legends and instantly felt like this game will take up quite a lot of your time i know how you feel ive been there myself as someone who plays mobas quite a lot i feel like there are too many unwritten rules to these games which players often overlook dont pay attention to or simply dont know about until way later onsince i always thought it would be nice to have an easy way to understand these obscure mechanics ive put together this mobile legends guide where i will share all the beginner tips and tricks that you need to know about everything you learn here should help you get started on the right foot and with a clear understanding of the gamemobile legends what is the games objectivethe games mechanics are quite simple you need to take down the enemy crystal which is located at the core of the enemys base to reach this your team will have to kill enemy outer turrets the turrets closest to the middle of the map inner turrets the second turrets you encounter closer to the base and finally base turrets the turrets located in the base right before the crystal to open the baseeach team will be able to choose a role which is assigned to a lane or to the jungleroamingganking very early on in the game most people will not stick to their roles and move chaotically thats fine until you rank up and start playing with more knowledgeable players roles will impact the game a lot more in these stageswhat heroes i should play in mobile legendsyoure just at the start but you want to have a good one so you should start by learning the skills of the heroes you own and try to practice playing them in their assigned roles you should then save some currency to unlock some of the meta heroes which are strong in the current patchseason you should take a look at our tier list to learn who they areplaying a random hero until you can afford one of the meta heroes is fine because you will be able to adapt to the game and better understand how it works and when you should and shouldnt fight also if you don know what class you should play yet try playing a hero from each role and see which one fits you the besthow do i playyou will start in the base there youll have to purchase items from the top right corner of the screen then move to your designated lane you will see an arrow pointing you towards the lanein lane you should try to kill creeps to gain exp and use the gold they drop to buy more items and upgrade your existing ones when you have a wave pushing towards the enemy tower let the minions take aggro from the tower and then attack itif you want to have a better understanding of each role you should check our roles guide where i broken down each role and explained in great detail how to position accordingly and much morekeep in mind the following tips you dont have to fight every time an enemy engages you dont have to chase enemies if they are running away you should not chase enemies under their tower the more enemy creeps you kill the more exp and gold you gain so thats should be your main objective you dont have to give your life for objectives towers because then enemies could turn towards your tower you should always try to deal the last hit to minions to claim the full gold and exp from themhow do i win at mobile legendswinning can be achieved by destroying the enemy crystal sometimes it will take some time because you might have to siege every tower and have all the lanes pushing if you find yourself in a difficult game aka unwinnable game take a step back and assess the situation see if there is anything you could to do help your team shut down the enemy team and take the chance farm more try to get more gold and exp and catch up with the enemies try to kill the jungle monsters for even more exp gold and buffs pull together your team and try to fight together not by legends how do i get diamondsyou can only get diamonds by purchasing them as far as i know there are no ways of getting free diamonds at the momentmobile legends how do i get battle points bpbattle points can be obtained in a number of ways from daily login to ingame events and much more you can use bp to purchase heroes

pocket gamer on the summoners war world arena championship was a huge success what can fans expect over the next year in the esports scenewe hope that we continue to see our fans enjoying our world

of plans to ensure that this game is the game that our users expected all these years once it hits the global market this will be the game that gives our users that have waited so long to dive deep

tomorrow is a recently released pointandclick adventure from developer glitch games it sees players solving a series of puzzles presented through beautifullooking dioramas our app army is wellversed in puzzling adventures so we handed the game over to them to see what they thoughthere what they saidtorbjrn kmbladsince the early days of the app store i have been a fan of escape the room puzzlers there is usually something soothing about trying to get out or get the idea of why you are stuck where you are quality has always been an issue and most of the games have looked quite poor in the graphics department this is sadly true for another tomorrow as well with a definite throwback ten years back it looks jagged and muddy considering that the first true escape the roommystery game was myst that looked better way back in the days of the pentiumprocessor i dot really understandthe puzzles are a bit disjointed and quite hard due to being well weird i had to resort to getting hints early on as i didt get what part was the puzzle and what part was the solution i get it that all studios dot have the muscles to create a quality game like agent a a puzzle in disguise but given the quality that these kinds of games can have it is hard to recommend another tomorrowrobert mainesanother tomorrow is a neat twist on the point and click adventure as you play you will pick up objects take photos and combine objects to progress in the adventure while suffering from occasional flashbacks that give you a clue about your situation the rooms are nicely rendered and the music is sublime the usual problem of point and click adventures is that frustration can quickly set in if you encounter a problempuzzle that stumps you its here that the game hint system is invaluable all in all another tomorrow is a good game that i look forward to completingsubscribe to pocket gamer on oksana ryanthis is a brilliant example of a puzzle game great graphics great puzzles and a great storyline that moves you forward there is an added facet to the game which entails taking photos of scenes for later reference there are all the usual codecracking key finding and headscratching puzzles that make this genre so enjoyable and to help in case your inner sherlock holmes has failed you there are clues to help you over the blank moments i also notice it has no inapp purchase all in all although i havent finished it yet this is definitely a game im enjoying and can recommend it for all puzzle fansmark abukoffas a point and click mystery this stands above the crowd in many ways the music was excellent and a perfect fit that added to the experience the environments have dimensions and atmosphere i like that you actually have to combine things and that yes youll have to sometimes in order to affect nonspoiler that environment the story and cutscenes and unique mechanics kept me interested and the clue system helped me the few times i needed itplus the ingame camera lets you take pictures to refer back to important clues comes in very handy if theres any complaint and its a small one id like the ability to zoom in for some of the smaller clues old eyes looking at an iphone screen would very much appreciate that overall however i found it a very good game that fans of the genre should enjoy happily recommendjc gathe first look at the game is very refreshing the isometric graphics are precise and offer a change from the usual firstperson pictures we generally find in this kind of investigationpuzzle game the great slow and serious music and the sounds give these nocturnal places a very successful twilight atmosphere the short cutscenes inserted in a violent way during the investigation insist subtly on the traumatic nature of the reminiscences of the character that we playi therefore found the atmosphere in which the game abruptly plunges us brilliantly immersive and very motivating to delve into the puzzles that make up the main gameplay they are neither too simple nor too complicated and do not give the feeling of dj vu as one might have feared the progression by adding new places gives a real satisfaction of discovering a new part of the investigation even the clues system is very clever and allows you not to get stuck without spoiling the reflection the time needed to complete the game is adequate and the story is interesting until the conclusionanother tomorrow is a beautiful challenging and innovative game it offers a very successful addition to this genre which is nevertheless very represented i therefore absolutely recommend it even for players feeling tired of a genre they would have already played a lotdiane closeif you enjoy finding clues and solving the puzzles in adventure games from syntaxity fire maple games and mediacity games then youll love glitch games another tomorrow the hook in this one that makes it different from those others is the set pieces are detailed dioramas rather than flat images you approach them from a firstperson perspective to zero in on their details exposing both clues and puzzles to solve and this game is definitely all about the puzzlesyou find clues and solve puzzles to unlock more clues and more puzzles until you finally reach the end of the mystery im loving it the overarching story arc is fed to you in extremely short cut scenes phone calls and bits of paper strewn around the environment but there are enough early reveals that you can figure out pretty quickly whats going onthis is a large game gb that takes hours to complete it runs seamlessly on my older ipad air running ios the graphics are crisp and detailed the sound effects and voice work are very well done the only gotcha here is its a british production which is sure to mess with north

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/silent-dot/app-army-assemble/,"App Army Assemble: Silent Dot - ""Is this minamilist puzzler worth shouting about?""",silent dot is a minimalist puzzler from indie developer sander vanhove that draws inspiration from barte bonte colour series and studio waterzooi please touch the artwork it promises to provide a simple but engaging puzzling experience so we handed the game to our app army to see if they thought it deliveredhere what they saidmike lisagorsilent dot is a rather simple straightforward puzzler that has you getting a dot to the finish in the fewest moves possible if you do you earn a star but the game doesnt tell you the number of moves necessary to get that star that is one of my gripes with the game you have to do trial and error other than that the game is ok and i breezed through about levels and decided to take a break nice game for short bursts of time but nothing special i have not seen a new mechanic introduced which makes the game sort of boring after a whileeduard pandelesilent dot is a beautiful minimalist abstract puzzler where you must traverse a hexagonal maze each move you make changes the state of most maze cells that is turns their floors on or off needless to say you don want to go into a cell whose floor will disappear on your next move so you need to carefully count your steps and that it there a single gameplay mechanic at work here which is interesting at first but as with all the purely logicbased puzzles it soon gets a little boring as you reach your own intellectual limit also who knew counting can get boring huhanother problem is that easy and medium puzzles are very simple actually because they almost always reduce to dilly dally around until you can pass through the last couple maze cells and then the difficulty skyrockets in hard mode where oftentimes there a single path to victory and every misstep sends you back to cell one with all the frustration that entails it might seem like a negative review but i actually had fun with this game and i think it worth the yup it a premium game with no ads a rarity these days so if you like abstract puzzles give this a shotsubscribe to pocket gamer on mark abukoffit took me a while to figure out the secret to this game but once i did i sailed through most levels with little difficulty in ways this is very much like a bunch of other similar games find a way to get through to the end of the level or try again or reset your progress on the level truth is i dont play many of this type of game because theyre more alike than different and so the attraction wears off quickly for me it does remind me vaguely of some of the go stealthtactical games where you have to find a way through a level while avoiding guards and cameras i liked that aspect of this gamewhat i didnt like was that i had to find a youtube video to show how to safely pass through each cell without getting sent back to the beginning in my opinion you shouldnt have to do that not early in the game a quick and simple tutorial could have eliminated that bit of early if brief frustration but thats not a dealbreaker overall i thought it was an interesting game and if you iike games like this its worth the inexpensive purchasetorbjrn kmbladsilent dot is a streamlined mellow puzzler where you basically have to move a dot into a triangle the levels challenge you by introducing different obstacles that have to be traversed to reach the end initially the difficulty is low but it soon ramps up with no tutorial i had to get into quite a bit of trial and error to get past the obstacles and quite a lot of backtracking with my dot to get past as mellow puzzlers go it i a quite nice experience playing silent dot the presentation is sleek with relaxing music i have however seen and played this kind of game before many times there is little to nothing special or innovative making it hard to recommendrobert mainessilent dot is a rather charming puzzler where you guide your dot across a field of hexagons to reach a triangle in the fewest moves possible you can only move one hexagon at a time and things start off very simple the difficulty soon ramps up with revolving hexagons that open and close hexagons to your dot land on a closed hexagon and you are sent back to the beginning of the level graphics are simple music is chilled and there are levels over three stages of difficulty some instructions would have been nice as it can be frustrating trying to work out what you need to do still its a keeper for meoksana ryanthere isnt a lot to this game but it is enjoyable to play the graphics and sound are simple and the gameplay straightforward moving the dot to the triangle without falling through the highlighted blocks i didnt find a tutorial and it took me a couple of levels to get into the rhythm of the game but once i did it was plain sailing through the levels i found it a good game in small doses and returned to it when i had ten minutes to spare its not a game that offers anything revolutionary but its a steady game that has enough challenge to keep me happypierpaolo morgantesilent dot is a puzzle game whose goal is to guide a little ball towards the end of the level represented by a tile with a triangle the levels are organized by difficulty roughly sixty in easy medium and hard the game is very simple and one picks up the rules very quickly maybe in the first five levels the challenging part is that the tiles switch continuously between solid and transparent and if you get stuck on one of them while the floor is not there the level starts againthe concept of the game is simple yet captivating the difficulty ramps up so that the last levels of the easy difficulty prepare the player for the first levels of medium as of now i played around levels and i tried some of the hard ones another strong point of the game is the graphics simple yet very polished the music is relaxing and it is enjoyable to listen to maybe the only drawback of the game is that it becomes a little repetitive somewhat boring perhaps but it is definitely worth the

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/encodya/app-army-assemble/,"App Army Assemble: Encodya - ""Is this point and click adventure an enjoyable throwback?""",encodya is a point and click adventure game from assemble entertainment that follows the story of a young girl and her robot companion our reviewer catherine recently shared her thoughts on the game but it never hurts to hear a few more opinions so we handed encodya over to our app army to see what they thought of ithere what they saiddiane closeon an android phone this game opens with an over download of necessary resources the first time you play it once thats done youre greeted with some of the crispest clearest graphics ive seen in some time it runs seamlessly with no glitches or delays subtitles are rendered in grammatically correct english the voice and effects work are excellent with only some of the speakers struggling a bit with their lines and the soundtrack is lovelyin gameplay you swap between a girl and a robot and on the small surface it can be difficult to get close enough to a hotspot to trigger the hint system doesnt identify all available hotspots making it trickier than necessary some of the puzzles can be quite frustrating so this is a game that requires a bit of persistence and patience at least on a tiny phone screenif you love linear old school point and click adventure games this is definitely one of the best in a while some users may be turned off by the story which makes questionable fun of racism discrimination and recent politics but if you can get past that youll find a polished classic adventure thats simply gorgeouschad joneswhen you start the game there are options story mode easy or harder difficulty after playing this game for a few hours i don really know what would be the difference between the two you can ask the robot for a clue but he states he would give you one except if you ask too many times he would basically shut down i don remember the exact verbiage i could see this being difficult to play on a smaller screen because there is a lot you can miss plus the characters can get in the way because no matter whom you pick to operate the other character is right there beside you and i constantly changing characters just to move them out of the way instead of accidentally clicking on them instead of the object i am trying to interact withthe music and visuals are great it been a great game to play with while i snowed in but it does have its little quirks i love the atmosphere and world the game is set in but the puzzles are a bit difficult at times and there is not any handholding at all point and click enthusiasts may really enjoy this game but occasional partakersnew players may get frustrated pretty quicklymark abukoffthis is really a good looking game mostly the two main characters the ability to switch back and forth between them has been done before but i always kind of like that i also liked the characters you meet as you go out collecting the things you need to collect the music is good as is the voice talent howeverthis game would have benefited with even a brief tutorial the hint system starts off by telling you not to use it very often that adds to the challenge but for people like me who are more interested in experiencing the story than the struggle of figuring out how to get past challenges its not an inviting aspectadd to that the not always precise controls and the fact that often one character will be so closely grouped with the other i frequently found it difficult to click where i wanted to maybe this would be better on a tablet of some kind but even on the decentsized screen of my iphone pro max it wasnt optimal i also noticed what seems to be a glitch early on i used my bad sushi wrong apparently and dropped it it was gone an extensive search with the very handy magnifying glass failed to turn it up and there was no way to replace it so i had to start over i hadnt been playing long so i didnt lose much time but it annoyed memy last note about this game is that i dont want to see the devs political opinions on display i just dont thats not why im here and i especially would be very unhappy if ive spent to be exposed to someones politics so heres what i have to say this game has lots and lots of potential its gorgeous and theres a lot of content but even a short basic tutorial would have helped the glitch so early in the game annoyed me and i while i appreciate that some games will have social points to make i would say to the dev leave out the political attack for this is good but could be a lot better i was disappointedjim linfordi have played a bit of the game and it is very blade runner inspired which i like a lot the game doesn really have a tutorial so took a few guesses and looking at the controls for how to control the characters the game is an old school point and click so it is a slowerpaced game the look of the game is both modern higher def and also low detail character models so it reminds me of something like the original oddworldthe controls took me a while one thing that is tricky is when you need to swap a character to reach an object you need to move the other character out of the way if they are originally occupying the space it would be nice if there was an animation that moved the characters out the way this may be too much of a nitpick also moving in and out of the plane you have to drag the character around and sometimes you can get stopped by the ui also trying to select the right thing can be a bit tricky at timesok onto the good the music and atmosphere is really nice the story great too the dialogue options and hint system controls are responsive sometimes a little overresponsive but it emulates an older point and click adventure game with an engaging story if you are a fan of these types of games and understand the quirks and internal logic of point and click games i would definitely check it

lockdown zone recently the game softlaunched in australia and new zealand in comparison with other shooter titles in the market lost light stands different due to its unique gameplay and conceptin this basic lost light preview and guide we will briefly discuss the different elements of the game and will take a closer look at what makes lost light different from the rest first we will start with the baf factory mapbasically the baf factory map is a small area filled with crates and ladders that connects to each and every corner of the location this particularly map tests out your skills in closerange combat and sniping although there are multiple maps to choose from initially the game asks you to complete various tasks in this particular map and after you level up you can proceed to unlock other maps as wellsoldierslost light has two types of soldier squads one is firefly and the other is marauder interestingly both squads operate differently and possess unique attributes firefly can be played when you first log in to the game whilst marauder can be unlocked after you reach level after completing certain tasksfirefly soldiers are tasked with invading the marauders territory and extracting valuable items for their survival when prompted to choose gear before heading to battle firefly soldiers can use any type of equipment they want and this can then be customized later on one of the best attributes of this type is they dont consume any energy when deployed on the battlefield but keep in mind firefly has no ally on the battleground you can and will get attacked by other firefly and maraudersmarauder is for the skilled players who can survive on the battlefield with any equipment or gear they are provided with marauders have allies on the field and the only enemy you need to shoot are the firefly the objectives are the same for both the squads but this type consumes a certain amount of energy during combat and during the pregame lobby there is no option to choose a loadout as the game randomly grants you one this type is preferred by those who dont farm exp points and only want lootstoragelost light has three types of storage for you to use and each serves a different purpose the first one is the common backpack that you take along with you into the battlefield to loot enemies after killing them but once youre dead those items are up for grabs for any nearby enemy or allythe second is secure case well this works as a safe or hidden section in your backpack that actually retains your items when youre dead however you want to save this to store the rare or exclusive items as it has very limited capacityand the last type is the main storage which is located in the lobby and can be found near the wall of your room this acts as a locker facility where you can transfer all the loot you have collected and later use them before heading to a battle this can save you from buying items that you have already collectedadditionally you can upgrade all the storages which can be done by spending some amount of ingame currency also you can sell some of your items if you run out of cash or your storage is fullpreparationuntil now we covered some of the essential information but here comes the most important of all what we mean by preparation is that the player has to select and modify the loadouts collect essential items from the storage and check their current health stats which we will discuss nextinnormal shooters you can collect guns and ammo once you land on the battleground or you select your desired loadout and the rest of the things are readily available once the match startsin lost light you will have to head to the action section to buy guns with your ingame cash and select a primary and secondary gun before you can move out of the base additionally you will have to buy ammo for each of the guns remember to follow this process unless you want to face the enemy without any weapon and youre not playing as marauderhealthlost light asks you to look after your characters fitness and health stats in every battle the damage your character takes affects one of their body parts which later needs time to heal or you can instantly recover by using a health kit one of the new interesting feature lost light has is called bleeding it continuously causes blood loss if your character has absorbed massive enemy blows if any temporary medical kit isnt used on time then the character will die on spot and the player will lose the roundafter you return to the base you can click on the human body icon that lets you see your characters overall health stats and to cure them the kits are available for a certain amount on the right side clicking on each item will indicate its use and a green colour blinks on the affected part that directs you to use that particular item on itfew basic lost light tips and tricks to use during the battlethese were some of the basic lost light tips and information about the different ingame

make you bop your head to the beat""",bright lights neon signs and some sick sick beats these are the very first things that dislyte throws at you right from the getgo and its an absolute thrill from the intro scenes to the electrifying tunes zapping away at your soul in the first battle alone its already pretty obvious that this isnt your average gacha rpgthe story of dislyteset in the nottoodistant future dislyte follows the tale of brynn rocking out on stage with her musical partner sieg right when shes in the middle of the performance of her life she gets attacked by unknown assailants that turn her whole life and everything she thought she knew aroundsieg disappears in the aftermath with a hasty apology and a cryptic goodbye while brynn is whisked away by a group called the esper union thrust into a world of humans granted with special abilities from gods and goddesses of varying mythologies these espers fight whats called the miramon which are basically alien thingies floating ominously in the skydislyte gameplay and combattypical of the genre dislyte features an energy system that you consume each time you go on missions in the main campaign you also use up stamina each time you participate in special dungeons to farm materials like relics equipable items that give bonus stats the cube miracle in particular is a rogueliteesque dungeon with increasing difficulty that you can try to beat to score awesome rewards while the point war is the pvp arena where you can try to attack or defend against other teams for points you can exchange in the shopcombat is a battle with your typical autofight function up to speed which is still pretty slow the espers you place in the front and the back lines dont really matter as theres no formation effect here neither are there any melee or ranged effects your attack power will really depend on your characters skills as well as on the star rating of your espersthis brings us to the summons pulling a character to be honest feels satisfying enough as you can always increase their star rating by feeding them fodder in the form of twostar summons whats actually more important here is how you level up your espers abilities plus the relics you equip them withfor instance mona the free esper the open beta grants you at the very beginning is an absolute beast on the battlefield despite her not being a character shes pretty godtier in my opinion because equipping her with the hades set of relics grants her a lifesteal effect where she absorbs the hp of her opponents equip her with an avatara set and shell steal foes hp each time she counters she basically takes care of herself and is a powerhouse of a farming unit plus she looks really cool toothe graphics of dislytespeaking of coollooking characters the strength of dislyte i strongly believe is how hella awesome every single esper looks character designs are just topnotch so much so that youll want to keep units too just because theyre such eye candy everything is just so beautifully designed down to the last detail which applies to both the art and the graphics of the unit when in combatskill animations and victory poses are a joy to look at and the voiceacting is simply amazing id keep playing this game for the aesthetics alone to be honest add that to the music pulsating with life in the background can we make dislyte radio a reality please and each playthrough becomes an absolute thrillboss fights that are not against fellow espers are totally exhilarating too theyre mostly largerthanlife monsters and their coolness factors are amplified by this disembodied voice telling you to get ready for the boss youll really have to play it to feel it the vibe is just brimming with so much energy with each battlewhats the appealguilty of judging a book by its cover i started playing dislyte because the app icon drew this classy anubisinspired butler looks super fly a week later and im still addicted to the game maximizing my stamina and lamenting my tortured fate each time it runs outi think its because you cant simply breeze through levels as in other gacha games here youll have to painstakingly level up even the most useless summons to consume them as fodder to increase your fave espers star ratings in fact this is the only gacha game ive played where i actually wanted to pull fodderplus because of the unique abilities of each esper its so darn difficult to play favourites when choosing who to include in my roster thankfully my esper named hall has both the looks and the skills to be a party staple his poison stack passive ability is op against single bosses and hes only a charactersuffice it to say that dislyte has effectively swallowed me whole i cant remember the last time something like this hooked me in with a vice grip i also really appreciate how when you choose to skip cutscenes you get this little oneparagraph summary of what the scene is all about making sure you still know whats happening even if you skip through everythingi suppose the only complaint i have is that i somehow cant connect using my wifi network and always have to resort to a mobile hotspot before i can log in i did report this to dislytes customer service team who was quick to respond to my issues now i can connect to my wifi on good days they did say theyd improve their network connectivity during this open beta and i think they somehow deliveredin summary dislyte is a musical cyberpunk journey that sets itself apart from cookiecutter gacha games with its oneofakind aesthetics its a delight to play it on portrait mode too just make sure youve got headphones on to appreciate the beats in the background im still waiting for them to upload their playlist on spotify which is hopefully something theyll launch once the game is officially released,en,494,Positive

legends mobile every day so we created this resource for you to read through to get up to speed with what could be one of the biggest mobile games of been talking about apex legends mobile for years now and while there was originally some fear that the port had been shelved announcements last february confirmed that it was in the works and we be finding out more soon this is no surprise ea has made it clear that they interested in expanding their grip within the mobile market in fact in the ceo andrew wilson went on record saying unlike many people in the mobile industry we built a very strong and profitable businessif you found yourself here then you probably looking for more information on what changes will be coming to the game the platforms it will release on and even the release date regardless of what you come here looking for we got you covered here everything we know so far about apex legends mobilewhat is apex legends mobileapex legends mobile is ea port of their incredibly popular battle royale title apex legends apex legends is a freetoplay battle royale game that was released on pc and xbox one back in february of it was recently ported to the nintendo switch last month in march apex legends mobile will be available on both ios and android devices via the appstore and google play we currently waiting on confirmation as to whether they come to other androidbased storefrontsapex legends mobile is expected to follow the same gameplay loop of apex legends players form into small squads of two or three then deploy from the air onto an extremely large island players land with no weapons or equipment and so have to quickly gather materials from the island they have to be quick though because there are generally around people in each match and while the island is big the match is over when only one team remains being quick means they also can be too picky players will need to learn to adapt to apex legends varied arsenal of weapons and equipment because you won necessarily get the equipment you most used towhat is the apex legends mobile release datewell here where it gets a bit tricky as many of you reading will know apex legends mobile release date isn necessarily global nor is it the end of development what that means is that we can expect to see its release on both ios and android around june or july the moment for the selected countries the regional launch date is officially march at pm pst those countries includeit will be available until may that when all of your progress and unlocks will get a reset and the servers won be active afterwardas an interesting note one of the games closest competitors pubg mobile is unavailable in india at the moment so deliberate or not this is some excellent positioning from ea co putting them in an optimum chance to capture an audience who cannot access either fortnite or pubg mobile on the two major app stores phewwill apex legends mobile be the same as apex legendsthere are a lot of questions out there about apex legends mobile will it follow the route of call of duty mobile and pubg mobile being a separate entity from the core or will it instead be more like fortnite or mmos like where the game will match and be crossplay with the other versions of the gameit been confirmed that the former is the case with respawn entertainment reportedly working with external partners to deliver the mobile version in information released on the of april ea confirmed that the game would be freetoplay built from the ground up for mobile and will not feature crossplay that said we not sure precisely where the differences will be although there is a regional beta starting rolling out right now in a few regionswill apex legends mobile be freetoplay and feature regular updatesbased on the fact that apex legends itself was freetoplay and that the developers have gone on record saying that it will be freetoplay it safe to assume that it will be what might interest you is that it is likely to follow the battlepass led structure of the core game each season brings new legends and new limitedtime modes of play but players can also grab a battle pass which will give players content as they continue to play the gamethe battle pass is reasonably priced and is a concept that will be familiar to most you pay a little bit of money into a game which frankly didn cost you anything to start and then it gives you cool new cosmetics and items as a reward it finely balanced and also adds a degree of structure to apex legends by giving people more challenges to overcomewho is making itthe original expectation was for ea to outsource the porting or redevelopment of apex legends mobile to tencent this wouldn have been too outlandish an idea due to the two partnering previously to work on games like fifa online and need for speed online while tencent involvement hasn been confirmed or denied we do know that members of the respawn entertainment team will be handling development albeit with collaborative efforts from other partnerswill apex legends mobile be crossplayapex legends mobile will feature crossplay with other mobile platforms from android to ios but it has been confirmed that because the game is being built specifically for mobile it will not feature crossplay with pc or console versions of the gamewhich legends will be available in apex

and when you step inside your journey to discover more about the world around you and about yourself beginswhile the amnesia trope is fairly common in narratives as a convenient excuse to make the player experience the world through fresh eyes i didnt feel like it was executed too well in revived witch its just that the main protagonist is already pretty blah as she is with no personality and no lines of dialogue of her ownfor a game thats supposedly narrativedriven its a shame to have a bland main character whos not compelling at all plus when you pit her against all of the other more colourful and more interesting characters from the gacha pool shes clearly the first choice to remove from your party lineup without hesitationby the way you can also increase your affection with dolls characters you summon to unlock their stories sadly these are simply texts of their past with no actual cutscenes so it begs the question of whether or not increasing affection is worth itrevived witch graphics and gameplaythe aesthetics of the game thankfully have more than enough flavour to make up for the static main character the pixelart graphics remind me so much of retro star ocean games youll have to explore dungeons and solve puzzles to get from one point to another whether there are levers you need to manipulate or switches you can turn on and offduring dungeon explorations youll come across treasure chests as expected of the genre as well as restoration spots that replenish your hp you may also stumble upon boosts that give you a quick buff for instance one particular boost can render you invisible to aggro enemies so you can easily slip past them in a narrow passagewaycombat in revived witchwhen you do encounter a monster along the way you enter the games battle mode where you fight foes with a party of three the formation is very important here whoevers in the frontline will take the most damage so be careful about slotting your party members in the preparation screen by the way the rightmost slot is for the frontline character and not the other way around i learned that the hard waycharacters will have different specialities beyond their unique skills tanks will of course keep your squishier character protected while assassins deal the most damage when it comes to physical attacks you also have your regular mages and your healers and its an absolute joy to test out the different character combinations thatll give you the strongest partyof course with this being a gacha game theres an autofight function here as well as a speedup button which is a little weird for me to be honest the game wants you to spend actual time and effort when exploring the dungeons and yet allows you to rely on autobattles when combat starts i just think its a little contradictory exactly which kind of gamers are they trying to please herewhats the appealthat i feel is really my main issue with revived witch i wasnt quite sure how much time and attention i should allot with every playthrough because its a combination of focused dedication and afk elements its a gacha game with your typical summons staminaenergy system and grindy raid dungeons for collecting upgrade materials but at the same time it wants to appeal to retro gamers whore looking for actual puzzlesolving and realtime navigation through dungeons and maps which are a little bland and repetitive if im being honestthere are also tons of other features to unlock including a cottage for your summoned characters to hang out and a bunch of other crafting mechanics while i do appreciate the added features it just feels to me like the game is trying too hard to be everything at once without really knowing how to pick a focus and stick to it it doesnt feel paytowin though which is a plusalso oldschool rpgs normally have convoluted storylines that grow deeper and deeper as you go along for the closed beta test i didnt really feel like the story was anything to write home about in fact if it werent for the absolutely breathtaking background music i wouldnt be motivated to go through the main campaignoverall revived witch is waifu galore with an adorable pixelart aesthetic plus a stunning musical score sadly it suffers from an odd lack of focus as to the kind of game it wants to be its nothing like another eden which shines as a successful modernization of oldschool rpg games still theres no official release date yet at the moment so heres hoping the game will still have plenty of time to work on improvements after this

game youll have to outhunt diana survive plutos wrath or triumph over jupiters trials for glory and ultimate bragging rights of coursethe story of runestrikein runestrike the gods lust for power led to a cataclysmic war that threatened all existence for both immortals and men as the resulting battle waged across the heavens magic trickled down as spoils of war birthing unspeakable monsters and giving rise to both heroes and villains among men with the divine power now in the hands of mortals the gods have unwittingly created their own downfall as champions rage against the immortals in an epic struggle for dominancethe exhilarating online turnbased strategy game lets you play your cards in a single campaign mode pitting you against jupiters various trials or tasking you to rid the world of ras villainous hordes you can also play pvp in the arena if you fancy a friendly fight or two whether youre hungry for a real human foe matchmaking is quick and seamless by the way or looking to test your wits against ai of a similar rank to yoursgiven that its a freetoplay game you can purchase currency and packs using real money but scaling the paywall isnt as hopeless as it sounds you can earn currency as you win battles in the solo campaign and in the arena as well as in the path of glory which is the games season passesque progression system with enough currency at your disposal you can craft cards purchase xp potions and even buy championsrunestrikes gameplay mechanicsas for the card battles themselves the mechanics are simple enough for a total newbie to get into yet deep enough to hook veteran ccg players for hours on end using a champion of your choice youll fight against other players or ai with decks you build from rune card packs each deck of cards can have minions or spells in them with varying levels of rarity from common to legendarymatches are incredibly wellbalanced with no single card that can dominate a battle or an overpowered deck that can ruin the player economy in fact ive had a handful of matches myself where i thought my seemingly op deck would bring me sweeping victories only to get totally wiped out by a beginner champion who simply knew how to play his cards betterthat to me is the mark of a truly balanced ccg that no matter how legendary you think your runes or your champion is you can still fall flat on your face if you have no idea how to use your cards effectivelycrimson company preview may the best decisionmaker winnow heres where runsetrike differentiates itself from other cookiecutter ccgs each champion will have their own set of abilities as well as cards they can use based on runestrikes realms of magic order cards usually provide various buffs while damagedealing chaos cards suit offensive players best nature usually deals with plants and healing myth deals with magic and light provides angel cards and health buffs as wellthe shadow realm contains undead minions while neutral cards are universal runes that any champion can use each champion can only use two kinds of realms at a time plus neutral ones as well as three blood abilities you can unlock as you keep using that champion to win battleswhats the overall appeali have to admit the very first thing that caught my attention with this game is its stunning visuals every card is so meticulously detailed that its hard not to spend half the match just ogling at the character designs in your deck plus exhilarating sound effects and a stirring musical score both make the next victory as satisfying as the lastto be honest its difficult for me to find fault in such a brilliant title when its as beautiful on the outside as it is on the inside if theres one thing id consider a con to runestrike is that the story never really takes you anywhere with such a gorgeous intro cinematic and compelling descriptions for every character youd think the plot would somehow advance into something as deep as the lore itself its such a shame that making fun spent all that effort developing the world of runestrike only to hold back on following through with the narrativefor instance every loading screen features little snippets of mythology here and there with such enchanting words and intriguing backstories i wouldve loved to see those character histories somewhere in the game even if it were just an almanac or unlockable gallery of sorts i can totally obsess over when i need a quick break from all the battlesheres an example of a character snippet from the loading screen vangelis touched draupnir at his arm recalling the moment he took it from the defeated form of odin he mused how those champions who thought him soft would learn the same terrible lesson that he had visited upon the allfather im dying to know what happens next or more importantly what were the events that transpired to lead to such an epic moment do you see what i meanoverall runestrike is a musthave ccg for fans of the genre and even for those who simply enjoy eyecandy art i wouldve loved for it to feed the narrativedriven gamer in me as well but i suppose i cant have everything can i,en,464,Positive
pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/seven-scrolls/app-army-assemble-seven-scrolls-dont-judge-a-scroll-by-the-quality-of-its-parchm/,App Army Assemble: Seven Scrolls - Don't judge a scroll by the quality of its parchment,seven scrolls is a deceptive game on the surface it appears to be incredibly simple and its unassuming art style adds further weight to that impression but once you played the game a short amount of time you realise it much more indepth than you be expected we sent our own app army in to find out if this surprising depth makes for a good gamehere what they saida very simple and intuitive game this is the kind of game that does its combat by turns all very simple and is good fun for those who like this style it has a cool soundtrack that completes the package of this game that will bring you fun in your spare time and especially when you are in line at a bank or something the matches are fast and require a lot of thinking to pass the stagessimple frustrating addictive if ever there is a game to illustrate that just one more go addiction this is it as some of the best titles this game takes a matter of minutes to learn but will take a long time to master with each run combing a mix of luck and skill i do find that the game can be unnecessarily evil with the scrolls it randomly generates at first which can lead to some very shortlived runs but guess thats the nature of the beastit would also be nice to see some bonus effects that can be carried from game to game rather than just over rounds to give some feeling of progression but overall despite these small criticisms its great and im going back for another quick go recommendeda highly addictive game you play the role of a monk with some weird powers in a roguelike game with randomly generated enemies you must kill said enemies to obtain keys to move into the next room whilst collecting scrolls that trigger different things during the gameyou may be dealt with a bad hand of scrolls that hinder your gameplay or one that helps you defeat enemies the art style is simple but is enjoyable and shows that you dont need amazing graphics to create a game with high replayabilityat first glance the game seems like a very simplified roguelikelite with an easy swipe to move or attack scheme upon replays of the game one soon realizes that a deeper strategy is involved as you acquire scrolls with various abilities both positive and negative you have to adjust your playing tactics to adapt to effects such as when a monster is killed it becomes a ghost or can travel through walls or it shoots to the rightmany effects can be used to your advantage such as the player healing after exiting the level the battles and movement are turnbased and you start to think about where the monsters will move as you carefully choose your moves attacking a monster as it moves towards you from several squares away helps you to get hit less often which scroll you collected is actually in play changes the dynamic of the game and keeps it interesting as you kill monsters to obtain the key and exit the levelthe game is great for playing in short bursts as the levels are compact and the scrolls you collect keep the game fresh being at home with the current state of affairs makes me go to this game for many short sessions as i try to improve my score and survive through more levels the game is worth the asking price as long as you dig a bit deeper and play a few rounds to see it strategysimple graphics and sounds will fool you into thinking the game itself is simple swipe to move swipe to attack poke to use spellswhat could be easier by the time you die you realize there is a much deeper game here equal parts addictive and frustrating this is a strategy game at its bestgarbage stripped away and the shining centre left for you to chew onkill the enemies to obtain the tools to progress farther in the game keys lives and scrolls are all there taunting youis the risk worth the reward as the screen gets more crowded the game gets harder to play trying to figure out if you can grab that key and escape before something slugs you pacman like tunnels add an extra layer of strategy this game is definitely on the just one more round lista game that is very basic and simple in its graphics and gameplay can be a winner if its interesting enough and seven scrolls nails that effectively the graphics are very simple and plain and my first reaction was not enthusiastic but the whole package is a winner a small map simple and workable controls brief and effective instructions the different types of scrolls resulting in different results some helpful and some just the opposite all of this adds up to an addictive game that can be played in short spurts but still challenges your patience and creativitythis game reminds me of imbroglio because of its graphics and art but it is a different game all in all i wasn expecting this game to pressure me to come back to it often but i have completely stumped by it so it works as you are in a dungeon and you are given scrolls that will affect your gameplay you can carry seven at a time and the scrolls always define how you play the gameyou have kill monsters and go deeper into the dungeon and it endless i think you can delete the scrolls if you think they are going to hamper your chances on winning but a price will be paid the controls are pretty simple swipe to move and swipe to also attack simple and works great it so addictive that it has that one more turn feeling because when you start playing you will die a lot and i am not even kiddingit frustrating at first but after a while you see a different layer and another and another and so onit very strategic and it very deep and it will make you think before you make a move and you will fall love with it because of its high score chasing as you want to play more to break your high score it very hard there are various strategies to get higher scores with one time you can go for a high score but when monsters surround you it gonna be bad i will highly recommend this if you are into turnbased dungeon crawlersthe game itself is actually very fun and addictive but it can also be very frustrating when you first start because you die a lot but once you get used to the whole idea behind the game and how it works it becomes clear that it is a very clever game and makes you plan and think about your next moveyou move your character around with simple side swipe controls and collect scrolls which have different effects on the game some help you out and some hamper your efforts collecting keys to move to the next level and life tokens to survive and see how far you can progress the game is simple but well designed and works well i recommend giving it a try if its the sort of game you interested inseven scrolls is a classic style of puzzler in which each move you make draws obstacles closer to you in this case those obstacles are monsters and your monk is capable of combat when directly across from a monster you must defeat the monster that is hiding the key in each room to advancegraphically the game is very simple with minimal animation however the art style is very unique and the muted colour palette lends to the feeling of progressing through a dungeon the music is catchy in a minimalist way but very enjoyable with enough sound effects to punctuate whats happening on screen the gameplay is handled by very simple swipe controlswhat makes seven scrolls stand out are the titular scrolls each level will present you the chance to get one or more scrolls each scroll has a different spell effect that is activated by the events on screen or single forced use the key to success in this game is utilizing these spellsthe spells add an interesting wrinkle to what could be an overly simplistic game overall id recommend seven scrolls to anyone who enjoys the type of puzzle game that is easy to pick up but difficult to master its good for a fiveminute time waster and extended playing sessions alikea simple looking turnbased dungeon crawler strategy game along the lines of hoplite and auro controls are simple just swipe and you either move or attack a monster in that direction monsters with hearts appear and will turnbyturn approach and attack you when monsters die they may randomly drop a heart to heal you a key to unlock to the level exit or a scroll with help or hinder youthe unique gameplay mechanism here is the scrolls you might get a scroll that kills a monster when the monk gets hurt but you might get a scroll that hurts the monk every time a monster is killed with triggers and effects that could be applied to either your monk or a random monster you never know what is kind of scroll you end up gettingyou can collect up to scrolls and supposedly there are only seven levels of the game the gameplay is pretty quick challenging and both addictive and frustrating thanks to the randomness of the scrolls so far my high score is only but i have to keep trying before long i might be as bald as the monkjt later returned with an improved high scorei finally beat level with a new best score it on to round more fun stuff to discoveri love this game it makes you think through your movements and gives lots of ways to move forward and defeat enemies the background music and sound effects are fit for purpose and the graphics are plain but adequatescrolls with various objectives help you defeat enemies and navigate to the next levels which can be very rewarding when you have several scrolls working together it makes you concentrate on your next move but you can never predict what might come nexttheres not a great deal to the game but there doesnt need to be its simple to play and great fun id definitely recommend itas you fire up seven scrolls there are two credits the sound design by jake almond which is great with soft gregorian chanting on the menu and soft ambient sounds under footsteps on cobbles as your purple monk navigates the grid be wary of the three basic enemies and four special enemies who spawn at shorter increments as you navigate to end of the level on the floorwhen reaching it you keep one of scroll slots for your next journey of floors every type of enemy has a drop chance the weakest little demon has a chance to drop health the strongest an angry chicken drops the key you need to exit level between them bear head drops scrolls every level also has a scroll on it scrolls consist of ifthen functions generated from a pool of targets conditions and effectsa scroll can be helpful or harmful and the sheer range of obscure effects can compound in a variety of interesting and unexpected chain reactions the aim is to hold onto powerful effects while burning harmful scrolls in ways that minimize risk burning executes a scrolls function even when the conditions for activation are not met destroying it when you have a powerful synergy going and the room erupts into destructive chaos every time you heal or fulfil a condition it really feels like a powerful deity lending its power to a devout vesselthe second credit reads inspired by michael brough the father of a genre this gridbased chesslike abstraction of the roguelike was carved into the genre with broughs phenomenal but the game that seven scrolls is really inspired by is cinco paus five wands the obscure follow up to broughs opus imbroglio cinco paus is a portuguese language game no localization for intentional obscurity where you have on a similar grid of a blue wizzard who wields wands each with secret powers which you only learn when casting the wand on the right conditionswhen you learn all the powers of all the wands they reset with new mysterious powers in cinco paus you have at best a brief slice of powerful magic to cast once per level in seven scrolls that same magic exists the way you draw from it is where the differences lie seven scrolls is the perfect companion to cinco paus they explore order and chaos through their contrasting models of magic a terrific title and a worthy addition to

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/punishing-gray-raven/punishing-gray-raven-review/,"Punishing: Gray Raven review - ""Beauty, tragedy, and awesomeness in a sleek, cyberpunk package""",very few games nowadays can catch your attention and keep it there with a vicelike grip especially when there are just too many titles on mobile vying for it in the virtual world where your time is a rare commodity choosing where to invest is a difficult decisionthankfully punishing gray raven makes it easy for you with its stunning visuals and engaging storyline the action rpg unapologetically demands your attention and youll find that its something youre all too willing to offerwhats punishing gray raven all aboutthe rich lore of this postapocalyptic world is too deep to explain in just a few sentences but suffice it to say that its a cyberpunk journey through a lost earth the deadly punishing virus has driven all mechanoids to turn hostile against humanity forcing the former inhabitants of the planet to flee as refugeesnow aboard the space station known as babylonia the human race looks longingly upon the blue marble they once called home yearning for the time when they can reclaim whats been lostas the commandant of an elite team of constructs called gray raven you lead missions and fight against the malevolent corrupted but as a group called the ascendants begins to sow seeds of discord among cyborgs and humans alike its clear that not everything is as blackandwhite as it may seemthe plot thickens as you unlock hidden chapters that put you in the shoes of the villains which i feel is one of the most ingenious gameplay mechanics ive ever had the pleasure of experiencing in recent years you can relive past missions from the point of view of your socalled foe and discover that perhaps motivations that appear villainous may actually have some merit after allmissions and combat in punishing gray ravenwhat makes the game stand out from your runofthemill jrpgs nowadays is its realtime actionpacked combat system there are no autofights and fastforward buttons here youll have to play through each battle fully invested with all your time and effort as you dodge shoot hack and slash your way through ruthless enemies whore out for your bloodeach construct you play will have its own set of abilities and combos and every new move is as stunning as the last the breathtaking graphics will have you watching in awe as your character flips through the air and performs sleek stylish and ultracool moves while dealing devastating damage to your enemies on the fieldthere are three orb types you can chain together in a way as linking a will unleash more firepower than a single orb on its own corresponding orbs will also match the colour of a reserve party member in your team so you can tap on a then tap on a construct of the same colour to have him or her aid you with a special move in battleyou can swap between constructs any time during a match but do keep in mind that theres a cooldown period when youre switching on the flywhen you dodge incoming enemy fire at just the right time youll enter a matrixlike bullet time that gives you the upper hand over your enemies dodges are limited however so you cant just zip around like mad unless you want to run out of dodges when it matters the most i cant tell you how many times ive needed to dodge only to find ive run out of juice and then i immediately perish in battle as expectedthe deep combat system of course also means that you cant just speed through each chapter willynilly youll eventually get to a point where the enemies will become too difficult for you so youll need to farm resources complete challenges and upgrade your gear as is typical of other gacha gamesnotsotypical of the genre like another eden is the fact that the gacha pulls dont seem as important since pulling a lessthanstellar character can still help you achieve sweeping victories if you know how to play your character right and if you can upgrade them properlyapart from constructs you can also pull weapons and memory which are stats you can equip to boost your performance in battle constructs have their own tragic backstories that are as engaging as the main campaign ive talked a lot more about this as well as the dorm and affinity functions in my punishing gray raven preview during the closed beta test and memories have character backstories as well all these histories make the narrativedriven gamer in me pretty wellfed and happyoverall punishing gray raven is a highly engaging game with one of the best storylines ive ever encountered so far unfortunately because the stories are what drive me forward i cant foresee how ill still be motivated to play this game when the arcs are done and the last chapter closesi dont see why id still play the game just so i can do random battles as the robots you fight and the backgrounds you fight them in can be pretty

december square enix announced just cause mobile for both ios and android it an exciting prospect on paper a franchise known for bombastic overthetop action making its way to mobile devices of course there will always be questions about how well it will play on a touch screen device but we like to remain optimistic here at pocket gamerif you parasailed onto this page you most likely looking to digest as many details about just cause mobile as you possibly can for your convenience we collated all of the currently available facts and a few speculations into one place whether that information on the just cause mobile release date or how it will differ from its pc and console counterparts we got you coveredwhat is just cause mobile and how does it differ from the console and pc gamesjust cause mobile is an upcoming action shooter that has been designed specifically for mobile devices this means that it be a little bit different from the main entries into the series whilst trying to maintain the dna of the games as such we can still expect to grapple glide gun down foes and blow almost everything up it just wouldn be a just cause game otherwisehowever a thirdperson action game with the usual level of just cause explosivity would likely be too frenetic on mobile devices therefore square enix has instead opted to go for a topdown perspective in just cause mobile the game will also have four different game modes for players to enjoy when it releasesthe first is a story campaign that sees you becoming a member of the agency secret program firebrand from there you be dispatched to deal with an enemy organisation called darkwater whilst battling against this organisation you rise through the ranks and form important alliances with various characters whom you likely be familiar with if you a fan of the seriesnext up we have triple threat a competitive multiplayer mode however whilst that immediately sounds like a smaller scale battle royale it actually a teambased game variant it will see three teams of battling against one another to secure bases and net points whilst fighting across large mapsthe teams can utilise a huge arsenal of weapons and vehicles to eliminate their opponents before capturing the bases additionally this mode also gives you the option to form clans with your teammates leading to bigger and better rewardsif pvp isn your idea of fun then you might be interested in the coop missions for a spot of pve instead in this mode a team of four will battle against waves of enemies in a series of missions these won just be your standard foot soldiers either the enemy won be shy about deploying armoured mechs and heavy tanks in a bid to destroy your teamfinally challenge mode is the last of the game variants that will be available at launch here you will aim to attain high scores in three different scenarios destruction wingsuit and race this might be causing as much explosive chaos as possible within an allotted time in the former or setting a speedy lap time in wingsuit or race challengessubscribe to pocket gamer on can i create and customise a character or do i play as rico rodriguezwhen just cause mobile releases for ios and android you won be playing as the usual series protagonist rico rodriguez instead you be creating a character from a selection of different aesthetic choices how extensive this feature will be remains to be seen thoughadditionally the game will have a loadout system that allows you to select your armour and gear these different pieces of equipment will bring set attributes that will suit different playstyles there isn too much specific information on what this involves just yet howeverwhat is the just cause mobile release dateat the time of writing square enix hasn announced the just cause mobile release date they have simply stated that it will launch for ios and android sometime in judging by the snippets of gameplay we seen so far it looks like the game development is progressing well but these are cherrypicked bits of footageit also worth remembering that the game will have multiplayer as such square enix may look to carry out various beta tests to ensure everything runs smoothly online before unveiling the just cause mobile release date therefore it may slowly roll out in softlaunch before it releases globallywill just cause mobile be premium or freetoplayunlike the pc and console entries into the just cause series just cause mobile will not be a premium title instead square enix has opted for a freetoplay model like with their other mobile games such as final fantasy brave exviusdetails on what the inapp purchases for the game will be are fairly scarce at the moment an answer to an faq regarding iaps on just cause mobile website reads yes there will be opportunities for players to acquire items ingameitems is a fairly vague term by itself this could refer to anything from gameplay boosters to cosmetic items for your custom character however given the game focus on multiplayer it certainly seems likely we see some cosmetic items available through inapp purchases there also the possibility that equipment can be upgraded

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/hardware-reviews/gamesir-g4-pro-controller-review-jack-of-all-trades-master-of-none/,"GameSir G4 Pro Controller review - ""Jack of All Trades, Master of None""",we don see mobile controllers that work for a variety of devices often enough if you like me you already have dozens of controllers for console and pc in addition to a fair few mobile controllers and accessories and i have so many because there aren many controllers which do everything i need i need fight sticks for fighting games and i need gamecube controllers for super smash bros ultimate i need xbox controllers for my pc and xbox and of course i need playstation controllers for my pc and possibly too one day soon and that list ignores the pad i used on mobile over the yearsso when a controller comes along and promises to replace several of the gadgets i have to juggle i celebrate i love the idea of condensing everything i need from all of these controllers into a single device it almost as good as when respectable cameras started getting included in phones by default and the gamesir pro has waded into my life and has promised to replace my nintendo switch pro android pc and ios controllers but can it do everything it wants tothe gamesir pro is a very traditional controller upon first glance it would be easy to misidentify it as a thirdparty controller for nintendo switch or xbox but that also the point you would identify it as a console controller first the layout and the way the controller is shaped is built to be comfortable no matter what the purpose and it feels goodthe two ergonomic handles sit in your hands comfortably and are coated with a soft textured rubber if you ever held a controller with offset analogue sticks think xbox and switch then your thumbs will immediately fall into place and it feels good the controller has a nice premiumfeeling weight to it and is genuinely more comfortable than most thirdparty controllers you use for any console having said that the plastics do feel a bit cheap and the rubber coating for your hands mask that until you pay attentionfinally there a phone bracket mount that flips up from the centre of the controller which extends to the width of your phone ready to play xbox game pass apple arcade or perhaps even emulator titles the hole in the bracket acts as a convenient place to pry it open with your finger while it also neatly encloses the led home button when closedi get this one minor weird thing out of the way the home button on my controller is upside down inside the clear plastic button you can see the gamesir logo and in my controller it is upside down only frustrating once you actually put the gamesir logo to memory of course so maybe just don look if your controller has this defect with that out of the way it is very nice how the logo lights up between four different colours depending on whether you attempting to connect the controller to pc switch android or iosthe four face buttons are very cool they have a satisfying semisoft press and the coolest feature by far is the fact that they are magnetic you can use your fingernail to pry the buttons up from the left side and swap them around this doesn change the button placement in software very important to note though it does mean you can easily swap their positions depending on whether you playing on xbox game pass or nintendo switchthe analogue sticks are also great and while i not a massive fan of the shoulder and trigger buttons they do mimic what you would expect from a modern xbox controller two big issues do arise though first the dpad is mushy and bad i do not like this dpad i do not recommend using it in games second the share button is located underneath the flipup phone bracket meaning you can easily access it while playing nintendo switch unless you leave the bracket propped open while playing a bit sillythe controller has printed on the back the instructions for pairing the controller with each of the compatible devices you simply hold the home button in addition to one of the face buttons for two seconds and the home button will illuminate with the correct light on android pc and ios you connect through bluetooth and it really is that simplenintendo switch is a slightly different experience though and i encountered two significant problems that gave me cause for concern first is that i had issues pairing the controller once i had finally had the controller paired leaving the pairing screen on nintendo switch would cause the controller to turn off instantly i found a fix for this by simply navigating to a different menu after pairing instead of immediately closing the pairing screen odda second issue is regarding amiibo functionality this controller has none that not a problem at all but when playing splatoon suddenly the system flashed an error message about not being able to read amiibo something i had never seen before from that message onwards my controller was exhibiting a ridiculous amount of input delay literally unplayable as the twitter gamers would saythis happened while playing splatoon a game which does occasionally use amiibo features in this game i was also able to test the gyro controls and sensitivity which work fine but feel a bit loose and less responsive than an official nintendo switch pro controller while playing on a game with no amiibo function i did not see this message and the controller worked perfectly as intended this was all on the latest firmware for the device and we can hope the controller has additional firmware updates in the future to iron this out but as of right now i could recommend this as a secondary nintendo switch controller but not your primary way to playthis is broadly a good controller both for mobile gaming and sitting down at your pc or nintendo switch there are a few hiccups along the way such as nintendo switch errors and the mushy dpad but if you going to be playing xbox game pass on android the occasional apple arcade game the odd multiplayer title on pc and nintendo switch then this is going to be an excellent supplement to your setupif you want to play a few xbox game pass games on your mobile in addition to your console or enjoy multiplayer on nintendo switch or play whatever on any of these devices then this controller is compelling it not perfect but down to the sheer amount of compatibility you should consider it for your next controller,en,434,Positive

Pass""",microsoft xcloud and xbox game pass initiatives can only mean good things for the mobile gaming space mobile is finally being seen as a proper platform which you can use to play traditional aaa console titles and game streaming is a huge part of that sure if you don want game streaming then services like apple arcade are there to provide you a highquality and affordable subscription with access to hundreds of games built for mobile play and touch screens but only on android can you seamlessly enjoy the likes of destiny halo guardians yakuza kiwami and much morewe already seen the razer kishi an ideal mobile controller to slot your phone into that delivers a nintendo switchlike experience but at razer usual premium price if you don like the idea of paying nearly double the cost of a new console controller for a mobile pad you might not use as often then you in the market for something just as capable and a bit more affordable if that what you want then the gamesir typec mobile gaming controller is exactly what you looking forthe gamesir takes after the razer kishi in several ways both of the devices go for nintendo switchlike design where the controller slides open and you slot your android device inside giving you a traditional controller layout on the left and right sides of the device when i first slid it open i was afraid i was going to break it but after opening it up to insert a variety of fairly large devices it it has held together perfectly and most of my fears have gone awayi like the controller placement after playing with the nintendo switch and particularly the hori split pad pro this feels entirely natural despite how unusually long the device looks the offset sticks are objectively the correct choice and the red and blue highlights to the analogue sticks seem almost like a homage to the nintendo switch design choice that and of course the split dpad buttons which are exactly like those found on the joyconthe back of the device has a convex bump covered in rubber for your fingers to claw around while playing and it certainly a good choice the whole device manages to be compact enough to easily slide into a bag while also being robust enough to feel comfortable even while gaming for long periods of time not bad at alland a final note on the design the typec connector on the controller does move back and forth slightly so you won worry about snapping it while fitting your phone into the devicethis device is positioned at a fairly budget price and therefore it makes sense that not every aspect of the controller would necessarily feel premium in this case it is the incredibly clicky selection of buttons the shoulder and trigger buttons made a fairly loud audible click while the dozen face buttons make a softer more muffled click if i had to guess i say there a rubber membrane underneath the face buttons in addition to the face buttons and split dpad there are s g home and share buttons s and g are just start and select or whatever names modern systems are using for them now while the home and share buttons again take after the nintendo switch with the home button working as you expect and share taking a screenshot of your mobile devicethe buttons are acceptable if this were a controller that i intended to use for long periods of time regularly i wouldn be happy but i use xbox game pass on mobile the way it is often intended to be used as a nice alternative to playing games at home i will always be playing games at home more and while portable these buttons are all perfectly serviceable though if you using game streaming regularly you might want better than thisas a plus point though the sticks are pretty much faultless there are luckily not like the analogue sticks you find on the joycon but instead are much closer to a proper traditional controller they spring back perfectly feel perfectly smooth to move and i just can really find a complaint the surface area of the thumb grip is a bit small perhaps but i feel like i being pedantic by just saying thatbut possibly the strangest decision gamesir made here is copying the face button position of the nintendo switch with the button on the right side when this controller is so perfectly positioned for xbox game pass otherwise this feels like a very weird oversight while jumping from games on console to mobile i almost always became slightly disorientatedthe gamesir typec controller is one of the more affordable mobile controllers of its kind and still does everything just as well as the bigbudget competitors like the razer kishi it almost as compact looks stylish feels comfortable and plays games greatbut the buttons aren fantastic and the general build quality while comfortable does make me think that the device won last through multiple years of heavy playthe gamesir typec controller is perfect for what it is a budget mobile controller perfectly designed to enjoy streaming games on services like xbox game pass google

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/hardware-reviews/pantera-pico-pc-review/,"Pantera Pico PC review - ""An affordable multimedia PC that fits in a pocket""",i feel like i hear the team a pc in your pocket to describe mobile phones on a semiregular basis the device despite originating as a portable way to stay in touch dominates most of our lives from vocation through to vacation however they lack some of the nuances of the modern pc which is where freshfaced kickstarter candidate the pantera pico pc steps inthe pantera pico pc is a palmsized pc complete with usb ports various ram options a dualband wifi receiver and more it not specifically targeted at mobile users instead offering a device that sits somewhere between mobile microportability and a laptop multitasking capability while right now at the end of a major multinational lockdown might not seem like the best time to discuss how to make laptops smaller as many of us have been working from home this is easily the smartest option ever offered in this spacesmartest that is from a nongaming angle this pico pc isn a bad little offering and at if you grab it at early bird prices on kickstarter it cheaper than picking up a prefab pc by a country mile however in the same way as you wouldn expect a prefab unit to be able to run the latest aaa game or be able to edit videos without major slowdown you shouldn expect the same from the pantera pico it aimed at filling a void in the workspace rather than the downtime however there are some notable exceptions that we get to lateras far as being a replacement or alternativeto a laptop or towerpowered workspace the pantera pico really delivers rig it up to a monitor or projector and you away you can quickly continue your work or dial into wifi and resume anything you were working on online it great for hotdesking or even for dialling in as a terminal however its portability is limited by the screen you have to employ to use iton that note though i found the patera pico pc that i was sent along to review to be useful for a couple of things that might not initially spring to mind mostly it has become a media storage device i got movies and music on there as well as a few tv shows and a couple of small games those are roles that i normally prep my laptop for when i going to be away from the house for a few days or out for an event all day i can now just carry the little pico with me plug it into a mains socket and plug it into anything that takes an hdmi input in order to get it goingnot only is it of course capable of running all of those various forms of media but that means that as i mentioned earlier with it being set up as a terminal i can remote into my pc or network to my pc from any screen in the house that means that it can quite quickly replace a few different devices from my collection the raspberry pi i run emulators on the steam link and quite a few of the memory cards i normally carry around for music or moviesthere are three more things that i want to discuss before i conclude this article the first is that without accessories the pc as with any other pc is pretty much dead weight you need to be able to connect it up to a screen and you need interface units like a mouse keyboard or controller in order to actually interact with it that is of course if you not just hotdesking while not majorly tricky it is something to remember when you look into the pantera pico laptops of course have screens keyboards and micepads built into them and phones run on a touchscreen the pico is a powerful little box but isn the complete package unless you pick up some extra accessoriessecondly is the power supply earlier this year i moved home this meant going through boxes unplugging excess cables and trying to pair five people worth of cables with the associated devices something became apparent very quickly there been no cable but every so often the industry gets close pantera pico pc uses a usbc power charger the usbc format has been seeing an increasing amount of use although confusingly there seem to be more wallsocket power variants out there than there have been other charger types over the years that not a problem out of the gate but it might become one further down the line if the charger is lost as there are a lot of options when it comes to replacing themthird and finally despite active cooling if you place the pico down on a flat surface then it start running hot fast uncomfortably hot too while the kit inside the box will no doubt be equipped to handle this and heat outside is not indicative of heat inside it does make it quite tough to handleas a multimedia centre or transportable workspace the pantera pico is sleek and easy to move around there are even accessories to focus it more towards any of those although the absence of a battery does limit its use while in transit considering its price of or for the version complete with ssd it is a complete bargain as a workspace desktop solution or media centre or media storage or terminal setup or many other intermediary roles in a tech setupif you interested in the pico pc then head over to the kickstarter where it is live through the end of september at the time of writing it is over funded and it unlikely to slow down we reviewed the ram version,en,417,Positive

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/hardware-reviews/anda-seat-t-pro-2-series-review-gaming-chair-meets-office-chair/,"Anda Seat T-Pro 2 Series review - ""Gaming Chair meets Office Chair""",i didn really want to start this review off as some sort of philosophical metaphysical pondering but i do have to start this review with a very simple question what is a gamer chair or gaming chair if we don go down the funny route of explaining it away as a chair that plays games indeed see reader chairs and moviewatching chairs then it is arguably a chair in which somebody sits when they play gamesbut there something else too there are usual characteristics and design choices that go hand in hand with the title gaudy or garish explosions of red alongside lumps of padding all held together by leather or some other sleek black fabric the anda seat tpro doesn really fit into the category instead it looks like a slightly steroidinjected office chair but with a lot of the modern conveniences and innovations that have sprung up in the gaming chair space over the last few yearshere at pocket gamer we play and review an awfully large amount of games however due to the portable nature of the phones where we play our games we often have the luxury of playing our games from our sofas or even our beds that not the case for most people who play mobile games though and definitely not the case for most people who play games on a pcin most cases people are sat at a desk of some sort floating about a meter away from a big screen briefly spinning away from the keyboard they tapping away at for a lot of people the way that we work has changed over the last year especially in the uk where we are based where workers have all been encouraged to work from home this has meant that there been a lot more time spent at desks at home many more than before and with that has also come an inability to get out and about and with that comes aches pains and exhaustioni not going to say that a good chair is like a caffeine boost that simply not true but what it can do is give a little bit of extra support where there normally isn any and that can mean that if you one of those people who normally shifts from leg to leg or lays diagonally across your chair back you going to be much less likely to do that on a chair with adequate padding especially if it set to the right heighti one of those people the fidgeters and as i start getting weary from sitting at a desk i start wrapping my body into strange positions like one leg up tucked close to my chest and the other dangling over the chair arm or another one laying with my head off the side of the headrest one leg tucked under the other which is in itself roughly in the right position both of these are fantastic ways to make me go from a situation where i can concentrate into a situation where i need to get up and pace the room in order to ease my lower back pain this might be a sign of me getting older but it probably more related to my activity levels and the fact that i fell off of a lot of moving vehicles and tall buildings in my youth i was actually quite surprised that i fidget a lot less with the support of the anda seat tpro it turns out there a big reason why people who have chairs of this ilk continue to talk about them it because they designed to alleviate stress from the parts of a body which are normally left sore after sitting in place for a while it safe to say that not everybody reading this or who already owns a gaming chair has fallen off of a house or off of a car that was going and so maybe a total cure of resting pain isn something required by the masses in which case it a solid upgrade from an office chairthat the thing as a somewhat expensive upgrade from an office chair the anda seat tpro comes with more than enough benefits and design strengths that justifies its cost in fact my complaints and curiosities about the chair can be counted on one hand and most of those come down to an issue that will likely always go handinhand with ergonomically designed chairs humans come in a variety of heights it safe to assume that the average basketball player and the average jockey are not the target audience for gaming chairs however clocking in at this reviewer is not too much shorter than the canadian or uk male average height both of which clock in at despite that it feels like the chair is designed for somebody about tallthe reason for this is the removable lumbar and head support unlike other designs from anda seat the tpro head lacks fitting holes instead of using an elasticated strap with a clip fitting while there enough play in the elastic the cushion cannot move down enough to support my neck while i sitting flat on the chair it a different situation if i sit on the lumbar support pillow at this point the lumbar cushion gives a lot of support to my lower spine through the ability to sink into the cushion however doesn provide any back support as per the standard use of a lumbar cushion to be placed behind the back and leaned back into ultimately i have a choice to have solid back support but no neck support or have lesser back support but solid head support this isn ideal a fix for this would possibly be an optional second lumbar cushion which can be fitted to the seat of the tpro users might end up feeling like they sitting in an oyster shell but it would make both included parts feel useablethe cushion situation aside this king size chair also comes loaded with a few extra features beyond comfort for a start it almost fully reclinable you can set the chair from a slight rock backwards into an almost fully laid back position with the chair aluminium structure reportedly being able to support up to of weight in any of the alignments i got to admit that it took a lot of getting used to especially considering that it on wheels and i have a wooden floor however since i grown used to it i found myself leaning back in the chair when my work shifts from desktop screens to smaller screens with the various cushions and your own weight pushing you down into the chair this is actually a surprisingly comfortable way to sit more so than the average sofa or chairin addition to that there the standard height adjuster however even at the shortest setting as you might expect from above and from the king size title my legs dangle away towards the floor with my heels unable to touch it when i resting back against the chair it feels a bit reminiscent of when you first changed from junior to senior school and spent about a year getting used to the larger chairs and benches but it does pass after a whilefinally there are the arms these can change elevation pivot inward and outward slide forward and backwards on their mount and also slide inward and outward these arms can be a little distracting if you prone to fidgeting and i certainly found myself idly sliding them around while thinking a side effect of being so adjustable is that the arm plate itself which can slide along two axes can feel quite loose at times that a shame because that and the pivot function which does also contribute a bit to the wiggling due to the mount casing are critical to the posture correction that you get when you fully lean back against the back of the chair it a minor flaw and i sure a lot of rd has gone into it because rattling noises really stand out when it comes to chairs especially ones that are a contender in the officeworkingfromhome marketplace like the anda seat tpro chair isnow here comes the conclusion it tricky because the above could be read like a long list of problems with a chair or it could be read as what it is a short list of minor niggles with a chair which frankly is the best chair that i ever owned i never had a gaming chair before so i can only compare it to the many office chairs that i had in that regard it is leagues better than any chair i ever owned and the fact that anda seat has clearly targetted a new audience with it is very impressive that audience targeting isn just underlined by the lack of bright red streaks down the furnishings but by the sensible selection of styles available grey black black and the fantastic blue black,en,828,Positive

deserve comfort""",comfort cannot be understated especially now when many of us are stuck indoors for long periods of time yes for some of us the pandemic has been a wonderful opportunity to be reacquainted with our beds but for others this has just meant an exceptionally long amount of time stuck at the desk staring at monitors and a lot less exercise i feel the struggle for even though i may usually work from home regardless i can feel my hips tighten my waist widen and my motivation wane with each passing day yes the pandemic has taken its tolls on us all in one way or another thus comfort is essential for getting us all through these difficult times whether it while wrapped up in bed or wedged between two monitors for hours on endbut hey even if you not sat at your desk you might be under a lamp for reading a traditional book you know the ones made of paper you might have a preferred nook to hide away in while playing nintendo switch and mobile games it might just be that you like pulling a chair up to the tv to get a bit closer to the action when playing an intense shooter regardless of what motivates you a good chair will benefit any and all of these situations and i am pleased to report that the anda seat dark demon premium gaming chair is an excellent choice for all of these situationsi am usually very active i used to go to the gym up to five times per week work out for more than an hour each time and then settle back at home to work with the pandemic i have been sat at home for months and in that time comfort has become more important to me than ever before i have always used multiple pillows to support my back during work and play while sitting around but the constant hassle of repositioning cushions and shifting around so my back stays comfortable while my posture stays proper is a frustration and without it i would be suffering from mild back pain in a matter of minutes thank goodness the dark demon chair from anda seat does so much to alleviate that stressthe dark demon is by all accounts a pretty typically designed gaming chair it has a similar form factor compared to many racingstyle gaming chairs and is made of the same kind of highquality pvc leather material you would expect from those chairs too the design aesthetics have a clear throughline to anda seat background making racing chairs for car manufacturers such as bmw and mercedes benz and for the purposes of designing a comfortable and stylish office chair these credentials are pitchperfect the chair looks striking to see whether that when guests enter the house or when you showing off your new throne on stream but still understated enough to not look out of place or gaudy at least this is the case for the allblack version of the chair which a little more quiet than the version with redaccentsthe removable headrest and lumbar pillow are going to be divisive for some users of the chair but i say this give it a good honest try before you decide against them there is a bit of a caveat to using them having the backrest of the chair pulled all the way up to make the lumbar pillow and headrest incredibly uncomfortable almost as if these two lumps are pushing you out of the chair you trying to sit in pull back the lever and recline just a bit however and suddenly they fit your posture perfectly when reclined ever so slightly i can suddenly sit in excellent comfort with the one caveat being that my bald head can sweat against the pvc headrest slightly those with hair won have to consider this one thoughyou can easily remove each pillow as they held on with elastic and clips which hold them firmly in place i did for a while use both pillows as support when sat on my sofa and for that purpose they not too bad as i said i always use pillows as lumbar support when sat down anyway and this chair just makes that process much easier though if there a downside to it from my perspective i say that the lumbar pillow does end up raising my shirt at the back quite oftenbut all in all if you want to be comfortable and keep your posture intact so your spine doesn crumple in on itself the dark demon ergonomics and aesthetics are excellent to make you feel comfortable in a position where you can also either focus or relax easily now what if you don care too much about posture and just need somewhere comfy to lounge aroundunless i sat with a mouse and keyboard and focusing really hard on a fastpaced fps i like to lounge while playing games i not usually here to put in my fullfocus and race to be the best i most often playing a singleplayer adventure and exploring whether that taking my time with genshin impact collecting items in pikmin deluxe or spending far too long on my horse in the witcher wild hunt in these moments i don want to be locked into whatever position is best for my posture i want to be in whichever position is most comfortable for me at that moment and i be damned if the dark demon doesn do a good job of delivering in those aspects tooone thing i must note while sat in the dark demon i had an unbearable urge to put my feet up on whatever was nearby i mentioned that with the pillows attached reclining the chair slightly is pretty much essential and while in this position it hard not to want to put your feet up on anything a stool a bed another chair a nearby person anything this is because it so easy to want to rest while in this position i did in fact pull up a blanket and lay it over myself and yes i could easily fallen asleep in that positionwithout the pillows in place there much more space for you to wiggle about in this dark demon and i found myself pulling my legs up on it sitting on them crossing them throwing one of them over the armrest while trying to get comfortable and the nice widebacked design of the racinginspired seats meant i could do all of this while still feeling comfortable and support even while typing this with a keyboard on my lap while sitting in the chair arm closely tucked in at my sides the ergonomic curves of the chair and resting against my triceps ensuring i never struggling to be in the comfortable working or resting positionluckily the chair is softly padded and comfortable all over including a very thick layer of comfortable form at the front of the chair so you won have any steel digging into you while leaning forward the weighty sturdy metal base might get scratched but will help you feel perfectly balanced even while reclining the chair all the way back and putting your full weight down build quality in general feels topnotch aside from one minor issue being the armrestsnow these armrests are not bad they just not inspiring they are meaning there are levers to raise them in height lengthen them away from your body push them out and in towards or away from you and then you can also angle them to point away from or towards you for me personally the most comfortable position was often just to lengthen them and keep everything else at default though it is nice to angle them slightly so you have a bit more room to pull a leg up if you so inclined the problem isn the adjustments you can make though it that the material on top of them is fairly stiff and hardit isn hard plastic but a hard kind of plastic foam while is certainly could been far worse than this i feel that i might have a sore elbow if i happened to push my weight into it while leaning for any length of time though the armrests are good if you happen to have a wireless mouse and keyboard using my lapboard combo and the tv as a monitor made for an excellent gaming experience though not a perfect working experience pulling this up to a desk is always best practiceand that basically what this chair boils down to it sleek stylish attractive and very comfortable but it also essentially a desk chair a really comfortable highquality desk chair if you are spending more time than you would like at a desk right now whether that for work play or both then you owe it to yourself to ensure you comfortable and supported while sitting there and for that purpose the anda seat dark demon is excellent while this is never going to give you the edge to play games like a professional streamer it will ensure that you are feeling strong and healthy no matter how many hours you spend sat at your desk,en,549,Positive

essentially a highend pc squeezed into an ergonomic sleek portable gaming devicetechnology is always advancing and while we may not always be able to predict what the next big technological advancement or refinement is there is always a rather simple pattern the new technology appears at a premium accessible to the wealthiest or the military it becomes more accessible and third parties adapt bundle or attempt to replicate it then somebody comes along and makes it all smallerhowever we never previously had crowdfunding to the scale that we had it now and it allowed creators like onenetbook to get to the finish line without going in front of a board of investors instead they took it to the public who lapped it up the onexplayer was funded in about when it reached indiegogo earlier in the year with the campaign closing out at just under to pocket gamer on a pc in your handswe received a prototype version of the device specifically the gen intel core variant which comes with of ram for those who don live inside the somewhat confusing world of pc components the gen is the current generation the is the thirdhighest of four subbrands and the g at the end means that it includes a discrete graphics solution that g is frequently swapped out for h hk hq u y or other variants when it comes to mobile but this is not a chip designed with mobile in mindthat does show of course while portable the onexplayer is wide at its widest point just over tall and roughly four centimetres deep on the shoulders compare that to and on the nintendo switch the device this will most certainly be held up against and it quite a hefty beastto be perfectly honest with you though it outshines the nintendo switch in almost every category and it does that because it pulls on each of the strengths of the various windows powered devices out there it like a windows tablet but it much more powerful it like a windows laptop but it much more portable even with the optional keyboard it like a windows pc but it actually portable and features a touch screen the onexplayer is a chimera a hybrid of a tablet laptop and pc dressed up as a portable consolethe onexplayer as a consoleall of that said the onexplayer is marketed as a console rather than anything else and that makes a lot of sense it answers a call that is being asked increasingly by those who game on their regarding controls by coming complete with its own controller literally built around the screendespite its visual appearance being closer to nintendo offerings the controller layout is closest to the xbox wireless controller with the face buttons joined dpad and shoulders being closer to that than other contemporaries notably where the xbox has the right analogue stick and dpad tucked in more central to the controller the onexplayer inputs are close to parallel to those above them on the faceperhaps most notable for me though is that the entire monitor is a touchscreen this is great touchscreens are brilliant and this means that i can play grand strategy games and realtime strategy games with immediate input there something more dynamic feeling about a touchscreen input than a mouse keyboard input when it comes to those games especially the kind i really like the ones stacked with menus and filters of course being that the device comes equipped with usb ports there no reason why you can plug extra peripherals init also equipped with a kickstand so you can sit further back from it when watching movies or if using a bluetooth controller to play it also useful if you optin for the extra keyboard for the device which mounts onto the bottom of the unit and can fold up over the screen to cover it for when it not in usefeatures features featuresthat not all though at times it feels like the onenetbook team have crossed the line between efficiently addressing concerns and featurestuffing it comes complete with a fingerprint scanner a microsd port and a whole array of shortcuts tied to extra buttons around the fasciathese include a turbo button which pushes the device to perform a bit better when running games like the witcher forza horizon or grid this is clearly felt although you do start seeing the battery drain down a bit quicker as a resultcleverly though there also a keyboard button this will instantly pull up the windows onscreen keyboard and also put it away however something i didn know as i didn run through full setup and the prototype version we received didn have instructions was that you could hold the button to switch the left analogue stick into a mouse replacement that incredibly clever and incredibly welcomebut then there also rumbleas somebody who mostly plays games on mobile and pc i was caught offguard by the oldfashioned rumble that built into the onexplayer it was reminiscent of the early xbox rumble not quite as crude as with the nintendo or playstation but definitely a little bit jarring and frankly a bit louder than needed combine that with the fans which do a great job of keeping the console cool but can get quite loud and you find yourself leaning toward using earphones while gamingas a gaming machinewhile you could due to the windows os and usb inputs quite easily use this device to sit there and do exciting things like tax returns or reading about celebrity mishaps it is arguably created with gaming in mind it performed admirablyi ran natively on the device the witcher grid and rainbow six siege with littletono problems on average settings ramp it up and there was some slowdown however when you dealing with an resolution screen that you holding at arm length there in my opinion very little need to push settings up to maximum maybe that my background in indie and mobile games speaking thoughthere something to be said about devices where the screen is held directly in your hands especially so when the controls are right there with it it almost hypnotic and feels much more absorbing than cramming a controller into a pcthe onexplayer gave me an opportunity to boot up a few old favourites and dive back into my steam library for a few hours i played games like switch cars spelunky rogue legacy and dead cells each require quick reactions and responsive inputs the device really delivered here i vastly preferred playing dead cells here rather than its nintendo switch counterpart where i really struggled with the inputsa future of portable pc gamingit been a great experience playing around with the onexplayer and for somebody who has thousands of games in their steam library i excited at the potential of playing through them on the go with something less unwieldy and spaceconsuming than a controller plugged into my laptop however it feels like the device hasn fully reached its potential in the spaces that it exploringit a powerful console and definitely the most powerful handheld console out there but it could lean into a few more learnings that we seen in the mobile space notably if there was an option to put a sim card into it so that you could get a connection then it would really complete the hybrid nature of the devicewith the windows os comes a stack of pros and cons when i received the prototype it had been used elsewhere it was full of relics of the previous user install directories uninstalled drivers and a lot of relic software new owners wouldn experience this as their first impression but it did make it incredibly obvious that despite its outward appearance windows is still an os that is trying to cater to too many audiences at once which means that there are lots of cracks where things can go wronga bespoke os isn the solution here but a tight customsetup and an optional resourcecleaner software like huawei early honor management suite could keep the agingupdating os management closer to the simple almost background update loops of most consoles and phonesthe elephant in the room though is the price point if you don dabble in computer construction and we in an age there where few need to then dropping on a device that as powerful compact and utilitarian as this isn actually outlandish if you have the finances i know people who have spent more on gaming laptops with lower specs if you do find yourself with that kind of money laying around and you looking for a high spec gaming pc dressed as a handheld console with solid features and a lot of modern functionality then you don need to look any furtherfind out more about the next wave of onexplayer consoles on the official indiegogo page,en,828,Positive

that will show you the best party for lords mobile monster hunt those lists have been tested they work great and you can deal the most damage with them but theres a problem though what if you dont have the specific heroes that are on those lists what if you dont have their passives maxed out or gearso with that being said i thought it would be much better if we do a general lords mobile monster hunt in this article sure you might be doing or or less damage than the best party out there depending on the level but i dont think thats the end of the world right but more importantly youll learn how to figure out on your own what kind of parties you want to send out against each monster based on the heroes that you havewhat is a lords mobile monster huntfirst things first though what exactly is a lords mobile monster hunt new players might be wondering the answer is pretty simple in lords mobile a monster hunt is a part of the game where you just send a hero party to hit and kill monsters on the map to get rewards any player can do it no matter their level the only requirement is to be in a guildwhy you should do a monster huntas a new player if you are wondering why you should bother with a hunt the answer again is simple you get rewards such as gems shields speedups hero chests and monster chests plus you are being a good guild member but more about that later on you can also get some of those rewards throughlords mobile codes of courseso in this picture we see that tidal titan does physical type of damage and its strong against high pdef that automatically means that we dont want to send heroes who deal physical type damage to fight it instead we should focus on sending out casters aka magic damage dealerswe see that the manual gives us another tip bring healers and heroes with powerful magic to take it down so there you have it put together a party of your best healers and magic damage dealers against this onelets check another one blackwing we see that blackwing deals magic type of damage and its also strong against high magic defense you already know what that means we dont want to send magic dealers to kill this one but lets continue reading the manual for more tips that will help us figure out our partythe blackwing constantly hungers for blood and will always lock onto the healthiest target in sight its venomous fangs nullify all life leech effects and its thick hide protects it from the strongest magical attacks take it down with brute physical forcebased on that tip we see that its pointless sending out a hero that deals magic damage plus life leech has no effect against that monster we also see that this creature will attack the hero with the most hp so a good party would be something like demon slayer black crow scarlet bolt tracker trickster are you missing some of these heroes its fine just send another one that does physical type of damagehunting busthis is when a guild decides to go on a monster hunt people people or whatever they all go hunting highlevel monsters in the end youll be rewarded with a large number of chests depending on how many monsters you slay obviously you need to find a guild that does that

also provide an energy boost its important as a new player to start working on maxing those passives heroes trophies and medals should be maxed out in order to get the most damage its important if you want to have high dps to work on these passives of course gear should be as well that goes without saying but if you are a player worry about that full energy hit should be used only if a you have no time and you are in a rush then its understandable and b when the monster that youve worked on is really low and you can secure the kill be smart about it and dont waste your energy for no reason calculate how much damage you need before you decide to go for a full energy hit every time you use a single hit the next hit you will do it will deal more damage as the damage boost buff goes try to

pocketgamer,2022/05/04,https://www.pocketgamer.com/clash-mini/interview-fan-fang-vlad-perge/,Clash Mini Interview: Fan Fang and Vlad Perge discuss the upcoming beta and creating an accessible strategy game,clash mini is heading into beta soon in canada and the nordic regions meaning a few lucky folks can get their hands on these adorable miniatures before making them do battle with this casual strategy game supercell shangai is looking to create the most accessible clash game to date in a whole new genrewe recently had a chance to chat with game leaddesigner fan fang and community manager vlad perge we discussed various aspects of the gameplay alongside the studio desire to create the most accessible game we also touch on clash mini thriving social media community and whether the team expected such a positive response before anyone had played the gamehow would you sum up the gameplay style of clash mini for those unaware is autochess a term you trying to avoidfang i think for myself i always call it a casual strategy game because a lot of strategy games give people the feeling of hardcore and stress where you have to think and learn a lot we want to do something different we think some strategy games can be very easy to play and stressfree so that our idea it just happened to be automatic fighting because it a cure it a solution to solve complexity issuescan you tell us about the star upgrade system and how that worksvlad the star system is basically there to incentivise players to differentiate their playstyle with the exact same mini that they have already in their deck you unlock the mini just by playing the game and doing quests all that kind of stuff and then you get the mini at zero stars and that the basic version as you unlock more copies of it you going to get the first star second star third star over timethose stars basically mark a milestone at which they get upgrades or new abilities once you unlock a star when you bring that mini into the match you can choose which upgrade goes next if you want to stack the minis on top of each other you don have to either because if you drag the same unit over another it will automatically upgrade it but if you want to have more depth in the game you can choose the order as long as you unlocked itthat been really exciting for the development team to do we did experiment with automatic upgrades and also manual upgrades originally it was all manual and people had to make a choice but then we also wanted to address the accessibility and ease of use so that been a cool experiment for us to try outfang the other reason for designing the star system is that we don want to have a traditional stats system because a lot of games use stats and ask players to pay and get more power but as a pvp game if vlad gets more power i have to and then we are equal again so it like a trick of getting the player to get more power but in the end they are the samewe wanted to do something different where you don need to get a higher level to be competitive so the star system is something players collect outside of the game but within a single game they still need to spend resources to activate a star upgrade so ingame players are the same because we have to use the same elixir we are given which is fairsimilarly could you explain what the special tiles are and some of the variantsvlad the tiles are tied exclusively to the maps that we have so the boards which you unlock just by going through the ladder and you unlock them very quickly you don have to be a super pro player to unlock all the boards we make them really accessible the first two maps you unlock are healing temple and the electro valleyhealing temple has a healing tile that you put a unit on top and when the battle commences that unit is going to get healing over time for a certain number of seconds that is extremely strategic because you can position a dps unit or a tank unit there depending on your strategy then on electro valley you have the energiser which basically increases the super bar of a unit but with that one you need to be careful because you need to put a hero or mini with a super barthe last one is the banquet hall the countess map and that one has the mirror tile which doubles any unit into two but with halved hp so you can either double your tanks or your dps or whatever you need to react to your opponent the good thing is we also randomising these tiles every round so you cannot just fortify yourself in one position and just go for it you need to move around and adaptfang the reason we designed this is because we want the game to be stressfree and accessible so the gameplay itself is super simple you just drag things to the board and they fight but the problem with that is that the game depth is not there and the game would become really boring because players all do the same thing so we need other things to differentiate players and game one from game two we implemented this system to keep the accessibility but also have some depth therei noticed there is a sudden death feature if the timer runs out what does this involvefang so when the timer runs out the game goes into a sudden death mode and all minis start to lose hp at the same rate and whoever has the last surviving mini wins the game basically we don want the game to go too long we don want the minis to fight endlessly it all goes back to accessibility because the fights are automatic if they are the same people will get bored so we have to cut the boring game before players get angry about the repetitivenessclash mini is a new take on the familiar clash characters they have a new look and personality why did you decide to take this approachfang it goes back to accessibility again i keep going back to accessibility because we are a group of chinese developers and we know at the bottom of our hearts we know we are more hardcore than our audience so we keep reminding ourselves whatever we do we should be extra focused on accessibility otherwise we are making something too hardcore for our players so the art style is the sameif the characters looked too real or too humanlike it does not make sense for them to not listen to me in most games where we control humanlike things we actually control them they listen to you but in our game they don so we need to explain why they don listen to you it because they not smart enough to know they are not human they kind of have their own personalities they want to do things on their own and they can communicate with us so we wanted to use that to explain why it automatic fighting because we want the game to be accessible that why they are toylikethe other thing is we want them to be recognisable but we also want them to be simple so we trimmed down a lot of the unnecessary detail and only kept the most iconic part of them so they were easy to recognise that why we ended up having this art style for players it cute but for us because we want to communicate the gameplay to players and make the game accessiblevlad yeah a lot of art styles in other games are very detailed and it really hard to differentiate things if there a lot of visual effects and graphics everywhere in our game we trying to minimise that and only focus on very specific momentsin the advertising for the game you often present the minis being played with by the regularsized clash characters is that official lore or is it just to emphasise how tiny these minis actually arefang that a great question because we been back and forth on this for so long we like okay so now we have these minis do we need to explain to players who they are at the start we thought it a board game that being played by the characters in the clash universe and we been doing this for the entirety of the development of this gameit wasn until very late we realised that a lot of players just like the minis themselves these guys are cute enough bringing a different art style bigger guys into the game isn needed maybe for clash players it fun but for other players they are just fine with the mini world it a new thing because we need to consider players familiar with supercell but also new players so for new players it would kind of confuse them so in the end yes in the lore we all know that it a board game within the clash universe but we don put the big guys in the game itselfwhich of the minis or heroes is your favouritevlad okay so when we started our community the first custom emoji we had was bowler he has these two white teeth that are sticking out and that it it like a little grin that he has constantly and these big black eyes that are just staring at you and it hilarious so i love him i am absolutely a fan of his designfang to me it is miner because when we first introduced this game to supercell as a new team they were excited about the china speed like you guys can make a game very fast but is the game fun can you guys make a fun game and miner kind of answered that question he dives under the ground and comes out on the other side so how do you place miner how do you use miner it really gave people a feeling of mastery and excitement when we showed miner to the company they were like suddenly this game has become fun you guys can make fun games not just make them fast so i think miner changed the perception of this game and team which is why i like miner the mostsimilarly what is your favourite combination of charactersfang for me i like miner and archer because archer special thing is that she aims the furthest instead of the closest all the other minis targets the closest enemy but if you combine archer and miner the miner goes to the back archer goes for the furthest so together they can get rid of the enemy squishy backline before your frontline gets killed with this you can surprise a lot of new players and get a lot of wins so i like this company it simple straightforward and very effectivevlad yeah i a fullon dps kind of player so i like dart goblin and healing ranger when she increases the speed so if you upgrade the healing ranger she has the ability to increase the speed of the units and the dart goblin is literally a machine gun at that point if you keep him alive for ten seconds he will take down a bunch of minis in a rowfang because he gains attack speed whenever he attacks he starts very slow but in the end he like a machine gunvlad yeah he ramps up and it can look really crazy i have created a bunch of videos for the community where i am cherrypicking the most overpowered looking scenes so everyone is judging them by that video and thinking everything is overpowered so if everything is overpowered then nothing is so therefore we got the balance rightclash mini has been described as more accessible than the other clash games was that a deliberate choice and why was it the path you decided to takefang everyone who joins supercell here in china wants to learn the supercell secret sauce we all know that we are not good enough to design something simple and beautiful we know how to make really complicated crazy big deep games so we knew that we needed to make something accessibleit hard to make something simple and fun it always easier to make something complicated so that you have more tools to use so for us it like the first game we making at supercell shanghai we may fail nobody has any expectation of us so we better learn the hardest thing so that we can use this chance of people having low expectations of us to grow as much as we can so how can accessible can we govlad coming back to the supercell culture our mission is to create games that are played by as many people as possible for many years to come our goal is always longterm accessibility with every game so our challenge was to create the most accessible game it always the goal a mission for us if you don make an accessible game not many people in the world are going to give it a shotclash mini is a freetoplay game can you tell us a bit about how the game will be monetisedfang we talked about monetisation very late because our goal is to build a successful game so the game didn have any progression for the longest time and realised it probably needed some for players who don care about competitiveness and just want to feel like they getting stronger every day that also important to keep them playing we want players to feel they getting stranger rather than making money from themso we have a very simple progression system you can collect minis and you can collect heroes the minis will get more star levels and a hero will get stats but they are really low you can play the game for free for one month and you will have on maxed out hero and be almost at the peak of the power of the game everything else is just variety but in terms of power playing the game for one or two months you get the peakin the future we are going to create more cosmetic content so players who want to support us like the game or want to make their characters look cooler they can spend some money but if they don they don have to pay anythingthe clash mini twitter account is incredibly active and the game already has a fan base dedicated to creating fan art and skin concepts did you expect this level of engagement and how does it feel to know people already like clash mini enough that it inspires their creativityvlad no i did not expect it i worked previously on a bunch of beta games before people can get their hands on something that tangible it really hard to engage and get their attention but i think the game packaging the way we announced it the way we talk to players and were approachable is extremely valuable and people react to thata lot of betas keep everything tight everything quiet until they have major announcements but by the time they announced something the excitement has gone and you have to reignite everything again but with mini and its unique art style the team being excited me being behind the scenes in the dev team trying to produce content to show the progress you can really see visually how the game improved and evolvedso it is very telling for the players to be like this is shaping up this is really exciting we getting somewhere i personally didn expect to have so much fan art but then once i saw it let make mini mondays a thing so we kind of incentivised that and that amazing because people organically come and love it and i am here for it i wake up at like or am and just check the clash mini twitter account for fun which is not something people do generally i just simply enjoy going on discord and twitter and having fun with people i hoping that going to go when we enter beta,en,718,Positive

items, and everything you need to know",in this league of legends wild rift seraphine guide you find everything you need to know about the champion from her skills and how to allocate them to her build skill combo and runes this is what you will find in the seraphine guide belowseraphine the starryeyed songstress is the next wild rift champion we will cover seraphine kit makes it so that she can be played both as a mid laner mage or aggressive support because she simply that awesomeif you would you could even consider her a sona basically her skills are extremely similar to sona except she has a lot more crowd control and a lot less healing as for damage depending on the build she can be a beast quite literallyalthough seraphine is quite squishy has a very low def and not a lot of hp when she surrounded by teammates she can provide a lot in terms of damage support and sustain i would recommend her for a complete beginner as long as you play a couple of games beforehand to get used to her rangeevery third ability cast will echo casting it again casting seraphine abilities grant a note to nearby allies for each note seraphine next basic attack gains attack range and bonus damageseraphine deals damage in an area increased by enemies missing healthseraphine shields all nearly ally champions and grants them movement speed if seraphine is already shielded nearby allies are healed increasing for each allyseraphine deals damage and slows enemies if the enemy is already slowed they are rooted instead if they are already rooted they are stunned insteadseraphine deals damage in a line charming and slowing enemies encore extends if it touches an ally or enemy championhow to combo as seraphine in wild riftyou could say that seraphine has quite a few combos having played her for quite a bit i gotten familiar with most of them but i really suggest that you practice her beforehand the reasoning behind that is that it not always easy to land her full combo since the area can be quite difficult to pinpoint all the timealso since she has good synergy with other allies that slow or immobilize enemy champions you need to know when to actually cast her skill and whether or not you need it empoweredthis combo is the best for supports or in team fights but it also the longest one the shield cooldown is the longest out of all three skills so you should always use it only when necessary and not to proc the passive also never use the shield as a random skill for charging the doublecast it almost never worth itthe cooldown of skill is fairly low so you can use it twice in fairly quick succession for the doublecastthis is one of the very few times when you can start your combo with skill because if you aiming for doublecast skill you aim to root or stun the enemies therefore chances are you won need a shield right away to mitigate damage and you have it right back in about secondsthis is not a superdupercombo per se but rather a skill cast that will be useful in most situations the first skill cast will slow the enemies down while the second one will root them for a second while they rooted you can then quickly use skill to poke them in the lanethis combo if you start it at stacks will doublecast skill and root them in place you can then use your ultimate skill to charm the enemies this combo is extremely useful in team fightsif you looking for a flashy skill combo that features the element of surprise you can maximize it by using flash in front of the enemies then quickly stun them by using skill and lastly use skill for additional damage if you want to you can even autoattack an enemy to proc the passive notes for extra damagein what order to level up the skillsfor seraphine depending on how you plan on playing her you want to level up her skills as follows for support seraphinelevel skill skill skill skill skill skill skill leveling skill until it maxed then focus on skill and lastly on skill don forget to keep adding point into your

combo and runes here is what you will find in the graves guide belowgraves the outlaw is the next wild rift champion we are going to tackle he a powerful and fearless pirate who is not afraid of getting his hands dirty after all he from bilgewater where plunder kills and outlaws are every man breakfastgraves is usually played in the jungle where he doesn have any difficulty clearing the camps and getting ahead in farm although he a marksman he won do that great in the lane because his kit is quite similar to jhin in the sense that he has to reload his gun however unlike jhin he doesn have any other waveclear abilities apart from skill which is not that great for laning phasehe extremely fun to play and although he not that beginnerfriendly you can definitely try to learn his kit if you want to shift into a jungle position he is and has been for the longest time a very good jungler both in casual and competitive play so give him a go you won regret itgraves shotgun has some unique properties he must reload when he runs out of ammo attacks fire bullets which cannot pass through units nonchampions struck by multiple bullets are knocked backgraves fires an explosive shell that detonates after seconds or seconds if it strikes terraingraves fires a smoke canister at the target area creating a cloud of smoke that reduces sight range enemies caught in the initial impact are dealt magic damage and have their movement speed reduced brieflygraves dashes forward gaining an armor boost for several seconds if graves dashes towards an enemy champion he gains two stacks of true grit instead hitting enemies with basic attacks lowers the cooldown of this skill and refreshes the resistance boostgraves fires an explosive shell dealing heavy damage to the first champion it hits and pushes graves back with recoil after hitting a champion or reaching the end of its range the shell explodes dealing damage in a conehow to combo as gravesgraves doesn have that many combos since hit kit is fairly straightforward you want to use his abilities depending on the situation for example you can drop the smoke screen to try and leave a fight by blinding the opponent however there are a couple of useful combos to pull off just keep in mind that you might need to head on to the practice tool to train using them a little bitthis is a pretty simple combo to pull off since graves has two bullets in his shotgun he has to reload every two autoattacks so you will use your skill to dash towards the opponent and shorten the distance between youalthough his ultimate has a set range you can use certain walls like the walls between midlane and river to send it off from one side to the other this will work only for specific terrains for example it doesn work on the big round wall next to the bluered buff but this is a nice way to snipe unexpecting enemiesthis is a very easy combo to pull off you can use it to escape when you being chased by enemies by dropping your smoke screen and then quickly using your ultimate which will push you back along with flashthis is a combo you can do before you get your ultimate and it usually ideal for when you ganking a laneusing your skill will quickly reset the autoattacks making it easier to stick to enemies and burst them downthis unique combo is quite difficult to pull off it takes advantage of graves high burst damage sequence and uses skill to catch up with the opponent and reset the autoattacks and deal tons of damage endgame this is one of the strongest combos on graves that can pretty much oneshot any squishy enemiesthis is yet another difficult combo but it slightly easier than the previous one however you need to make sure that the opponent is in plain sight and not anywhere close to their towers because the shots from skill will not go through turrets or any terrain for that matterwhat the best order to level up the skillswhen you level up his skills you want to prioritize skill then skill and finally skill skill

the second champion in wild rift that i will cover thus continuing on our journey to learn more about every single character in league of legends wild riftahri is a mage with immense powers and not only in the stories on the rift she an extremely high burst high damage champion who has the ability to inflict crowd control and even sustain to a certain extent her kit is not particularly easy to use but not crazy hard eithershe relies mostly on her mobility in the form of her ultimate which allows her to make some amazing plays and utilize her kit to the fullest of the time on her auto attacks manawise she is exactly what you expect from a mage a little bit manahungry and quite reliant on items and teammates to peel for herif i were to think about ahri kit overall i would say that it was designed to make her some sort of assassin mage but with the ability to get herself back to safety also she could play from a safe distance since her skill allows her to kill minionspoke players from a relatively ok distancein this league of legends wild rift ahri guide i walk you through everything you need to know about the champion from her skills and how to allocate them to her build skill combo and runes in this ahri guide you will find the followingwhenever ahri hits a target with a spell she gains a stack of essence theft when she has enough stacks her next spell that hits an enemy also heals herahri sends out and pulls back her orb dealing magic damage on the way out and true damage on the way backahri gains a brief burst of movement speed and releases three foxfires that lock onto and attack nearby enemiesahri blows a kiss that damages and charms an enemy it encounters instantly stopping movement abilities and causing them to walk harmlessly towards her the target temporarily takes increased damage from ahriahri dashes forward and fires essence bolts damaging nearby enemies spirit rush can be cast up to three times before going on cooldownhow to combo as ahriahri has quite a number of ways that you can execute her combos since ger kit allows for a multitude of plays i will name just a few down below but i am sure there are like a million more ways to go in and out with ahri and obliterate your lane skill activate it before going in skill skill skill once or twicethis combo will pretty much allow you to go in charm the opponent and burst them down with foxfire and orb of deception if you follow up with the ultimate you can quickly close the distance between you assuming that the enemy not dead and they flashed away it would be ideal if you could save one or two dashes from spirit rush to get yourself out in case you end up too deep in the enemy skill skill skill skill doing this combo you can initiate a fight basically you can go in with the ultimate activate foxfire on your way in charm the unexpecting opponent and hit them with orb of deception you can dash around them with the remaining ultimate charges to get the kill or dash back out to flash skill skill skill skill combo is the ultimate allin you basically use your flash to engage the enemy player who probably doesn expect it then you charm them and follow up with the rest of the skills bursting them down you could do this underneath enemy towers as well as long as you have your skill to take you back to safetythese would be three ways in which you can combo with ahri of course there are a number of other ways you can engage disengage burst enemies down or assassinate unexpecting enemies appearing from a bush i won get into all of them because you will most likely discover them on your own however these three are some very basic ahri combos that work like a charmin what order to level up the skillsfirstly you want to max out ahri skill orb of deception then skill foxfire and finally skill charm of course every time you can level up the ultimate make sure you do solevel skill skill skill skill skill skill leveling skill until it maxed then focus on skill and lastly skill best summoner spells for ahriignite ignites target enemy champion dealing true damage based on level over seconds and inflicting them with grievous wounds grievous wounds reduces healing effects by you played ahri before then you know she is quite manahungry manaflow band and regeneration will help you especially during the laning phase as for hunter vampirism you can swap that out depending on the situationother viable options are triumph weakness goes well with ahri charm gathering storm for more scaling ap or brutal for more penetration choose this rune depending on what the enemy team is playingthese items are what you would call core on ahri you have plenty of burst damage ultimate haste ultimate cooldown reduction plenty of ap and magic penetration through void staff there could be a million variations to the build but in essence these are some of the best items that you could build on herdepending on the matchup you can swap out morellonomicon or void staff for liandry torment or even build infinity orb for more execute power which will have a good synergy with triumph runebootsi personally consider gluttonous stasis to be some of the best for the sheer sustain that they grant magical vamp the stasis is great because as ahri you can dive the enemy under their tower and use the active stasis to go invincible for secondsanother option would be ionian boots of lucidity ability haste with ionian shadows enchantment or ionian protobelt enchantment these are completely situational as sometimes you might want to slow enemies down with ionian shadows or have an additional dash with protobelt,en,413,Positive

and everything you need to know",next up on the list of champions we cover is yasuo he one of two brothers whom i had the pleasure of playing against a million times and none of these times was particularly enjoyable of course playing yasuo is extremely fun because you can use his skills in a lot of ways both defensively and offensivelybut let talk about the actual champion for a second yasuo is a fighter with heavy assassin tendencies his skillset might seem quite easy to pull off at the start but in fact it not as easy as it seems you always need to think ahead see which champions and creeps you can dive to and if you have a way to get outhe can be played in the top lane baron lane or mid lane because he can heavily influence the map his wave clear is quite good especially after an item or two which will allow him to roam freely across the map there are so many other things about yasuo worth mentioning but i will start with the most important ones his skills and how to actually pull off a couple of basic combos i won write them all down because then i be writing a yasuo bookin this league of legends wild rift yasuo guide you find everything you need to know about the champion from his skills and how to allocate them to his build skill combo and runes this is what you will find in the yasuo guide belowyasuo critical strike chance is doubled additionally yasuo builds toward a shield whenever he is moving the shield triggers when he takes damage from a champion or monsterthrusts forward damaging all enemies in a line on hit grants a stack of gathering storm for a few seconds at stacks steel tempest fires a whirlwind that knocks airborne steel tempest is treated as a basic attack and scales with all the same thingscreates a moving wall that blocks all enemy projectiles for secondsdashes through target enemy dealing magic damage each cast increases your next dash base damage up to a max amount cannot be recast on the same enemy for a few seconds if steel tempest is cast while dashing it will strike as a circleblinks to an airborne enemy champion dealing physical damage and holding all airborne enemies in the area in the air grants maximum flow but resets all stacks of gathering storm for a moderate time afterward yasuo critical strikes gain significant bonus armor penetrationhow to combo as yasuowe not played with yasuo enough to have fully figured out his best combos but there are plenty of places to find that out including this very informative video from assassin dave so if you want to fully grasp the power of the unforgiven make sure you check it outin what order to level up the skillsyasuo skill is one of his signature skills aka the tornado we all know and not love especially if it followed by last breath his skill is the one that allows him to dash to minions and players so these two should be your main focus with his ultimate whenever it possible to level it up wind wall is not a priority so you can keep just point in it adding more will only lower the cooldownlevel skill skill skill skill skill skill leveling skill until it maxed then focus on skill and lastly skill best summoner spells for yasuoignite ignites target enemy champion dealing true damage based on level over seconds and inflicting them with grievous wounds grievous wounds reduces healing effects by teleport a short distance forward or towards the aimed directionhealrestores health and grants bonus movement speed for second to you and the most wounded nearby ally champion healing is halved for champions recently affected by healother good options to replace hunter vampirism are triumph weakness or brutal for more penetrationthis build works great on yasuo because it makes him less of a squishyfighter assassin and more like a steady damage killing machine three of these items give yasuo life steal which will make it extremely difficult for the enemy to burst him down even in extended team fights unless they have grievous woundsadditionally you could replace one of the items withstatikk shiv and another with guardian angel but believe me when i say this build is extremely strong and in situations he will be unkillable it more a matter of positioning and not taking unnecessary fightswith these items yasuo can split push and take objectives quite fast and is less likely to die to burst damage from lux annie or any other champion that has cc and burstbootsgluttonous teleportis one of the best boots you could get if you planning to win games through objectives at the moment not a lot of people are playing that because it fairly easy to get around the map however on yasuo it can work extremely well for split pushing and joining team fights getting away from difficult situations or drawing a couple of enemies towards you in a different lane yasuo could do very well in situation depending on the championsif you would like to check if yasuo is currently in meta take a look at our wild rift tier

and everything you need to know",next up i going to give you a complete wild rift guide for janna who is a champion that helped me climb in rank quite a bit the storm fury is an exceptional support champion and is ideal for both complete beginners and experienced players alike janna can do well in most matchups because she extremely mobile has one of the highest movement speeds ingame if not the highest and easy to understand and playall you need to know in order to play this support champion is how to target your shield and crowd control the enemies because that pretty much what her kit is all about janna is the best pick against teams that have a lot of engage champions because with her ultimate and skill you can knock people up and even throw them away from your teamin this league of legends wild rift janna guide you find everything you need to know about the champion from her skills and how to allocate them to her build skill combo and runes this is what you will find in the janna guide belowjanna passively gains bonus movement speed and nearby allied champions gain this bonus when moving toward herby creating a localized change in pressure and temperature janna is able to create a small storm that grows in size with time she can activate the spell again to release the storm on release this storm will fly towards the direction it was cast in dealing damage and knocking away any enemies in its pathjanna summons an air elemental that passively increases her movement speed she may also activate this ability to deal damage and slow an enemy movement speed the passive is lost while this ability is on cooldownjanna conjures a defensive gale that shields an ally champion or turret from incoming damage and increases their attack damagejanna surrounds herself in a magical storm throwing enemies back after the storm has settled soothing winds heal nearby allies while the ability is activewild rift janna how to combojanna has no particularly difficult combos because she is not a burst champion whose skills you need to use in a rapid success for guaranteed success instead she has one major combo that can really leave your enemies speechlessdepending on the situation janna could pull a crazyultimate combo that most enemies will not expect basically if you use flash skill monsoon behind the enemies you will knock them towards your team or under your tower that is not always easy to pull off and it requires very good coordinationthat would be the best combo you can cast on her and also the most impactful the others are pretty simple and i wouldn call them combos either way let me give you a couple of hints about them you can use your skill in the direction you want to run let it charge and when the enemy will chase after you you can release it during the laning phase you can poke with skill then quickly cast an autoattack because the enemy will be slowed down when trading attacks you or your ally with an enemy make sure you use skill because it adds additional damage and mitigates some of the incoming damage you can try to steal objectives with your charged skill or use it for vision if you using aery as a rune aery will cast if your skills hit an enemy you can do that to check if the enemy is doing drake or baronin what order to level up the skillsin most situations you want janna to start with skill or skill if the enemy has no real damage skills at level you can start with skill otherwise start with skil to mitigate a lot of the incoming damagelevel skill skill skill skill skill skill skill leveling skill until it maxed then focus on skill and lastly skill add a point to skill ultimate whenever it availablethe best summoner spellsignite ignites target enemy champion dealing true damage based on level over seconds and inflicting them with grievous wounds grievous wounds reduces healing effects by teleport a short distance forward or towards the aimed directionorexhaust exhausts target enemy champion reducing their movement speed by and their damage dealt by for secondsflash teleport a short distance forward or towards the aimed directionbootsthe main difference in the janna build would be the boots you can choose between two types of main boots depending on how you want to play if you want to roam a lot then you want to go for boots of swiftness if you want to stick to a lane mainly and not roam that much then ionian boots of lucidity are for you i recommend boots of swiftness of the time because janna can outrun every single champion ingame with them and her passiveswift redemptionis the best choice if you want to focus on teamplay and team healing you can target it in a big radius around your character even after your champion has died and it will heal all allies within rangeswift shadows are an alternative but i believe that redemption will be more useful for the entire team since janna has a slow on her skill by defaultif you would like to check if janna is

and strategypacked parts of the game by levelling up quickly and advancing in the game you one step closer to those bitsanother great reason to focus your attention on these quests is that they will slowly introduce you to the actual battles that you fight in the long run where you will slowly get accustomed to the mechanics of the game and all the other elements of the battlesyou will obtain all of the officers by completing these chapter quests so the faster you do it the more officers you will have available to deploytip scout to reveal the great resourcerich areas around your baseour second warpath tip is related to scouting every time you are idle in the game you should go ahead and scout the map around your base when you notice a camp or a raven that you can raid then assemble your troops and get going this is one of the best ways to stock up on resources in the early game all while gathering exp as wellyou should also try to estimate the respawn time for some of these camps especially if you are farming a specific resourcewhen in doubt fight raven campsravens are camps that you will notice scattered all around the world map you can fight these in order to farm resources so try to discover as many as possible and loot them alltip open chests to unlock powerful campsas you slowly level up you will start to collect universal coupons that can be used to summon various units make sure you always collect of them before you summon because the odds of getting and units are slightly higheralso readnever summon using universal coupon at a time because it simply not worth it have some patience instead and collect before you go ahead and use themwhen you get any camp unit start upgrading it right away chances are it will be a lot stronger than any of the and below units that you already own so swap them out in your army as well after you level them up of coursetip make sure you are always researching a new featureas soon as you are able to build your research center you should go ahead and start researching one of the most important features that you need to research is industry engineering tests because that will increase the general tech research speed but you should also consider upgrading the military functions that fit you the mostsince there are three main types of troops camp liberty vanguard division and martyrs watch if you focus on a specific one then prioritize that otherwise just focus on upgrading all of them equallyafter you unlock the other research branches you will focus mainly on collections and whatever else you feel is necessary to boost your cp according to your play styletip join one of the top active alliancesof course this is one of the basic warpath tips as most similar games are encouraging you to do the same it might take quite a bit of time but joining one of the top alliances comes with its benefits and they are quite important believe it or not first of all you will be able to receive help from the other players whenever you are researching or buildingdeveloping something thus reducing the number of speedups you will need to usethen you have unlimited access to a bunch of great features

increasingly difficult game mode where you have to complete specific tasks in a certain amount of time or by following very specific orders these tasks get more and more difficult so you won be able to finish them all as soon as you start playing if you are stuck at one of the levels don despairgo ahead and continue playing as usual and keep on upgrading your warpath units you might need your

your own roblox gfx most people use blender blender is an opensource tool used to create animations and images you can use it to animate your character and create little scenesblender is free to use and download but does take a powerful computer to run having a computer that can run it to create these images is one thing that you do need to have you will also need to be patient when it comes to exporting images as exporting images will take a lot of time especially in complex imagesat the end of this article we will talk about a second mobilefriendly option that is actually a lot easier but it will not create images as realistic as the ones in blendersubscribe to pocket gamer on how to export your roblox avatarwhen it comes to creating your roblox gfx you will need to import your avatar i am assuming here that you have roblox installed on the computer you are working on what you will need to do is open up roblox studio not any of the games the studio application then you will need to select the baseplate template if you do not see the properties and explorer boxes on the righthand side of the screen you will need to expand the view tab and make sure they are selectedfrom here youll want to hit the play button under the home tab at the top of the screen this should load your avatar into a blank world on the righthand side of the screen after your avatar is loaded you will need to click on the word workspace and find your username you will then need to rightclick your username and press export selection save your avatar somewhere safe so you can then open it up in blendergfx images were created and provided by celerat a gfx artist currently looking for work on the roblox formswhat about backgroundsonce you have your avatar you probably will want a background to go with it you do have a couple of options with this you can either find other creators backgrounds using the search feature in roblox studio or you can create your own using the toolbox in roblox studio its up to you to tinker around and figure out what works best you can find lots of background creators on instagram if you are looking for oneit is worth noting that if you want a background you can actually export it with your avatar instead of exporting your avatar on its own you can import your background of choice into the scene move your avatar so that it is not on top of the background but do keep it close to the scene and then save them as a obj together this will be much easier to upload and tinker with within blender itselfusing blenderwhen it comes to using blender to create your roblox gfx there are so many things to keep in mind from exporting your avatar and possibly your background youll need to open these up in blender itself from there there are a lot of options you can use rigs to position your character move them by hand change around the lighting add different filters and so much more blender is a powerful tool used for animation and design after all so its dabbling in the world of animationif you are interested in the rigging side of things picklepiehas a bunch of rigs that you can download and tutorials on how to specifically use themas you develop more knowledge in blender through courses and tutorials you should be better suited to understand what you can do in blender it is a long process and does take a lot of time and you will probably be better off following stepbystep video tutorials for exactly what youd like to createwhat if i want to make roblox gfx on mobilenow if you are looking for a quick and easy way to create roblox gfx on mobile you can do so many developers have created photoshoot games which you can find by searching for the word photoshoot on roblox there using your mobile device you can go to greenscreen areas select poses and then take a screenshot on your mobile devicetwo good photoshoot games for example are tiger photoshoot center and gfx studio green screen there you can also select a bunch of different poses for your character which can really helponce you have your character all set up you can take a screenshot with a greenscreen background this image then can be cropped and uploaded to a photo editing app of your choice a popular app often used is ibs paint in these apps you can select your avatar and remove the green screen behind it uploading your own background images
