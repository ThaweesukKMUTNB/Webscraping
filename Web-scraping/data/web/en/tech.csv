illness?",computer gaming was one of the lucky industriesto growduring the pandemic global revenues are expected to pass billion in the next two yearsbut the industrys financial success is drawing some concernlast month the world health organizationformally recognizedvideo game addiction as an illness butquestions remain about how prevalent the issue is particular among adults parmy olson hosted a twitter spaces on march withhenrietta bowdenjones a medical doctor and founder of the uks national center for gaming disorders they were joined by lisa jarvis a bloomberg opinion columnist covering healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry below is an edited transcript of their conversationhenrietta bowdenjones my national problem gambling clinic was going very well and in was replicated times i managed toadd on this gaming clinicbecause of peoples concerns around loot boxes peoplewanted to know whether young people who were attracted to loot boxes while gaming might eventually be more likely to sufferfrom gambling harmhenriettathese gamers arestill living at home but what i see at this clinic is by no means representative of who is really suffering from this problemim still perplexed by the fact that im not really seeing one has to ask thequestion are they out there and dont know we exist thats unlikely so are the ones who are gamingcompulsively not ready to come for help or is there a spontaneous remission that gets people to stop and start getting betterhenriettai dont think there is a clear answer yet people ask me whether the decision to classify gaming addiction was a good idea or noti was delighted that decision was made because its allowed people like me to open a clinicthe nhs would never have allowed me to offer treatment to people for something that was not deemed to be a disorderlisa jarvisi think there might be a little too much scaremongering we have allseen the headlines calling video gamesdigital heroin or blamingviolent crimes on video game addiction those tend to stick in our brains especially when youre a parent and trying to weigh how much time you should allow your kids to spend on minecraft or robloxits worth remembering that the disordered behavior only becomes a problem for a very small percentage of people who engage in gaming i think studies have put it at to of people who are at risk of becoming addictedremember thatfor some people the social component of gaming can be very helpful especially during an isolated period like the pandemic theres also some science to suggest that when you dont use gaming in excess it can be beneficial improving attention spanhelping with spatial relationships and problem solving some companies in the biotech world are actually using gaming to try to tap into the positive effects on the brain the fda has approved a video game that helps kids with adhd improve their attention span as a digital medicineso there is potential for harm but i dont think we should assume that all gaming is bad which can too easilybecome the narrativehenrietta we still dont have a clear understanding of the prevalence but its unlikely to be extremely high itcertainly isnt an epidemic lisa mentioned to but there are much higher prevalence ratesin several research studies particularly in asian countriesone of the first things we need to do here in the uk is to have a very thorough gaming disorderprevalencestudy to understand who is suffering from this illnessfor most people gaming is funi would also pick up on the social side several of our patients were very scared about being sent for treatment at our clinic because they worried that we would cut them off from their support networks wecreateda program that allows a couple of hours a day for people to remain connected while at the same timeimproving the activity sideoutside of gaming developing skills returning people to their clubs andsports becausea lot of these kids were very competitive in real life before they translated it all into gamingthepeople weve seen with gaming disordersare gaming without any controlin our patients were gaming for to hours a day on average you hear about patients refusing to go to school there is an element here of the game replacing something for these childrena third of our patients said that theyd stopped looking after themselves whether its changing their clothes or showeringhalf of our patients reported violent responses when parents try to remove consoles or phoneslisai think about this as a parent all the time when it comes to parental controls different gaming consoles have ways of letting you set limits directly on the device or from your phone i know parents who use an app that turns the wifi off at a certain time in the evening so that kids are forced to take a brain break from games and social media tooone thing is to start early with trying to set limits around the use of screen time generally the american academy of pediatrics has some clear guidelines making sure youre setting a time limit that is based on the childs agemaking sure kids do their gaming after theyve completed other tasks like their homework or choresmaking it really clear what happens when a child breaks a rule on gaming and making sure the content of the games is appropriatethe toughest one i think is being consistent withenforcing those rules to prevent things from going out of control in the first place many of our rules went out the window during the pandemic when our kids were home during remote schoolhenrietta ive got two children who are a bit older now but i wouldcut gaming off at two hours and then put their nintendos in the oven which was high up where the kids couldnt reach of course sometimes id forget and turn the oven on and thered be these two consoles getting warmer and warmergaming disorder is rare but severe when you come acrossit weve had patients openthe window andthreatento jump out leaving the house in the middle of the night to walk for miles to go somewhere where they can find internetattackingthe parents breaking down doors to try and get tolockedup devicesthey are inventive and they are assiduous in their pursuit of these activities in a way that is very hard to imagine in such young children by the time we see them there is an exasperation in the parents and a hopelessness sometimes feartoo arecurring themeis when the children get angry they take it out on their brother or sister or the family dogpeople we treat present with poor regulation of boredom low mood with social anxiety and low selfesteem if you match that with the idea of the escapism that gaming provides and indeed the rewards ata time when schools were closed you see how someone could easily get into gaming morelisasome of these games purport to be educational i think it would help if there was more research on whether those actually have benefitshenriettai agree with that age verification is also really important and technology must come to the help of our young playersbecause we know that impulsivity can be an issue for some of our patients making it too easy to purchase things is an issueive been advocating for a long time for an independent board that can receive concerns from parents about specific games and look at harm we often talk about a harm indexand how helpful it would be for parents to understand

Minecraft developers challenge game industry’s NFT love affair,a fierce divide has emerged between some of the worlds largest videogame publishers and their staff over the adoption of nfts and blockchain technology now a team of insiders wants to hold the industrys crypto advocates accountable for introducing any damaging consequencesstudios including square enix holdings co konami holdings corp and sega have indicated an openness to adopting nonfungible tokens and blockchain technology in their games spying a potential for profit in an industry that has typically struggled to make money from the products it creates blockchain featured heavily as a topic of discussion at this years game developers conference a toptier annual gathering for creators with companies promoting a decentralized future where players can buy a sword in one game and play with it in anotherbut the gulf in opinion between leadership and the employees who actually create the games is vast proponents supporting the introduction of digital ownership into games visualize players amassing inventories of tradeable merchandise or turning their hobby into a side hustle but many developers say nfts are an exploitation of gamers trust creating tiered communities in games that benefit the wealthiest players while failing to address the risks of crypto scams and inherent environmental costs publishers such as ubisoft entertainment sa and group plc were forced to roll back or entirely abandon nft projects this year after staff showered leadership with hundreds of scathing commentsagainst this backdrop an independent group of game developers artists and staff from minecraft maker mojang studios joined forces to draw up a pledge on digital ownership which calls on studios to commit to being fully informed about the downsides of nfts and cryptocurrencies before implementing them in games signatories must promise not to build games that foster artificial scarcity and speculation disproportionately benefit early adopters or wealthier players or use energyintensive and volatile cryptocurrenciesfor us as game developers nfts change the meaning of what a game is and that to us is quite worrying said cory scheviak a minecraft game developer who coauthored the pledge with fellow minecraft concept artist mariana salimena people can make all of the side arguments they want about giving people jobs and the things they say are positives but at the end its never really been about players its never really been about helping people its always been about making as much money as possiblepublished on tuesday by scheviak and salimenas ecogaming group climate replay alongside a sprawling guide to nfts and their impact in the games industry the pledge also reflects input from the

to over billion players and we have an opportunity to show them a world that could be different escuadra added but in reality playtoearn and nfts are perpetuating the harm caused by the financial and economic systems that we already have in the real world it creates a portrait of a world that is very much still focused on making moneythe million hack that axie suffered last month represents another risk too in taking more of players money gaming companies hold even more responsibility for ensuring the security and relative value of those funds since the attack was made public in late
